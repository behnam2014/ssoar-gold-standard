Modern democracies are unthinkable without parliaments. Parliament provides the	60.5275993347168	360.2086486816406	10.0	355.1629524230957	5

The parliaments in communist Eastern Europe existed more or less as rubber-	61.945396423339844	99.67108154296875	10.0	331.1290054321289	10
stamping bodies. Although no Eastern European communist regime abandoned its	37.85039520263672	111.38299560546875	10.00006103515625	355.1659927368164	10
parliament, it was so subordinated to the Communist Party apparatus that particu-	37.85039520263672	123.09503173828125	10.0	355.1599807739258	10
larly its legislative activities and oversight functions were minimal, at least until the	37.85039520263672	134.80694580078125	10.00006103515625	355.2139663696289	10
1980s, when communist leaderships throughout the region began to lose their grip	37.85039520263672	146.51898193359375	10.0	355.1519546508789	10
on society [see Nelson and White 1982]. The wave of political change that swept	37.85039520263672	158.23098754882812	10.0	355.1449661254883	10
across Eastern Europe in the early 1990s propelled parliaments almost overnight	37.85039520263672	169.9429931640625	10.0	355.1559829711914	10
from institutions with very limited autonomy in decision-making into bodies that at	37.85039520263672	181.65499877929688	10.0	355.1709976196289	10

least two reasons for the pivotal role parliaments acquired. First, parliaments were	37.85039520263672	205.07901000976562	10.0	355.1569595336914	10
handed the task of drafting and ratifying the new democratic constitutions. This	37.85039520263672	216.791015625	10.0	355.17603302001953	10
presented them with an opportunity to cement a strong position for themselves	37.85039520263672	228.50302124023438	10.0	355.14298248291016	10
within the emerging political system. Second, parliaments were endowed with sig-	37.85039520263672	240.21502685546875	10.0	355.1349868774414	10
nificant powers from the start of the transition, as the previous communist consti-	37.85039520263672	251.92703247070312	10.0	355.15894317626953	10
tutions had made parliaments powerful institutions (at least on paper), and it was	37.85039520263672	263.6390380859375	10.0	355.1609878540039	10
these same constitutions that established the rules of the game under which the	37.85039520263672	275.3510437011719	10.0	355.1480178833008	10
new parliaments began operating in the post-communist era.	37.85039520263672	287.06304931640625	10.0	260.94397735595703	10
However, like most other institutions in the region, parliaments have under-	61.945396423339844	300.4760437011719	10.0	331.0519790649414	10

immediately after the uncertain and extraordinary period of transition to democracy	37.85039520263672	335.612060546875	10.0	355.1569595336914	10
(i.e. from 1989 to the mid-1990s). This article provides an introductory overview of	37.85039520263672	347.3240661621094	10.0	355.1759719848633	10

there are no differences. CEE parliaments have always differed in many institution-	37.850677490234375	452.7432861328125	10.0	355.1750183105469	10

However, the rapid and somewhat disorderly process of party formation had	61.945396423339844	123.41900634765625	10.0	331.0559768676758	20
negative consequences for the links between parliament and the electorate. Many	37.85039520263672	135.19598388671875	10.0	355.1309585571289	20

were formed instead. For example, in contrast to the initial eight parliamentary par-	37.85039520263672	158.74996948242188	10.0	355.1070022583008	20

1991. In Slovakia, eighteen parties and coalitions registered for the elections in 1994	37.85039520263672	194.08099365234375	10.0	355.16199493408203	20

The fragmentation of parties and the party system caused a good deal of con-	61.945396423339844	301.7740478515625	10.0	331.0639419555664	20

the representatives and the represented. However, it also affected the internal func-	37.85039520263672	325.32806396484375	10.0	355.1659622192383	20

Consequently, individual MPs introduced their own legislation, often against the	37.85039520263672	360.6590881347656	10.0	355.15396881103516	20

The links between parliament and the electorate are also shaped by the elec-	61.945396423339844	397.6900939941406	10.0	331.0400161743164	20
toral system. The system of proportional representation (PR) based on party lists	37.85039520263672	409.46710205078125	10.0	355.1599807739258	20
combined with large constituencies generally favours representation by parties	37.85039520263672	421.2441101074219	10.0	355.19104766845703	20

the British first-past-the post, is more favourable to the formation of such links. The	37.85039520263672	456.57513427734375	10.0	355.1249465942383	20

However, the key problem with electoral systems in the region has always been	61.945396423339844	528.9371948242188	10.0	331.0649185180664	20
the relatively frequent changes they have experienced. Manipulation of the electoral	37.85039520263672	540.7141723632812	10.0	355.21399688720703	20

is certainly a positive development given the scale of party fragmentation that exist-	60.5275993347168	98.63616943359375	10.0	355.1900215148926	23

Nevertheless, certain patterns are now emerging across the region as parties	84.62159729003906	183.87521362304688	10.0	331.0869903564453	23

during the first half of the 1990s [e.g. Baylis 1996]. The conflict between the former	37.84989929199219	360.9839172363281	10.0	355.1619415283203	36

[Kopecký 2001]. Parliaments of course benefited most from these conflicts, because	37.84989929199219	408.4159240722656	10.0	355.13401794433594	36

However, they also created (or continued) a system of government that comprised a	37.84989929199219	493.1219482421875	10.0	355.15394592285156	36

This means not only that the governments or presidents were initially unable	84.62159729003906	123.41900634765625	10.0	331.05992126464844	39
to create and maintain the executive dominance that is typical for the established	60.52759552001953	135.19598388671875	10.0	355.17806243896484	39

been poor, as is evident from the frequent amendments and changes to existing	60.52759552001953	158.74996948242188	10.0	355.14498138427734	39

The civil service in CEE countries is still considerably politicised [Grzymala-	84.62159729003906	219.33499145507812	10.0	331.0850067138672	39

been involved in this shift. First, as mentioned above, parties and party systems are	60.52759552001953	266.4430236816406	10.0	355.1989974975586	39

This process had a significant impact on governance in CEE countries in gen-	61.945396423339844	123.98516845703125	10.0	331.0240249633789	42

[e.g. Verheijen 1999]. It is of course still too early to assess how well these reforms,	37.850406646728516	183.43521118164062	10.0	355.1479148864746	42

led to the professionalisation of central administration in key policy areas, and this	37.850406646728516	230.99526977539062	10.0	355.1569175720215	42

The position of the executive in the region has moreover been significantly	61.945404052734375	256.4762878417969	10.0	331.04400634765625	42
