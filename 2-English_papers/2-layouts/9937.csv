generation Cuban immigrants in South Florida. The analyses are derived from biographical	144.6999969482422	194.99249267578125	9.0	363.51905822753906	5
narrative interviews with six Cuban Americans. Three key subjects were in the biographical life	144.6999969482422	209.1925048828125	9.0	377.6040802001953	5
stories—the notion of escape or leaving, the sense of home, and constructions of Cuban identity. In	144.6999969482422	223.29248046875	9.0	398.27711486816406	5
assessing these themes, we found there to be profound differences between the generations.	144.6999969482422	237.49249267578125	9.0	374.27406311035156	5
Moreover, these Cuban biographies demonstrate how differing stories of migration provide new	144.6999969482422	251.592529296875	9.0	380.9341583251953	5

and discussed here connect to the ambivalence and complexity of belongingness and	144.6999969482422	279.89251708984375	9.0	343.25111389160156	5

How do immigrants from Cuba and their children characterize their sense of	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	369.4929962158203	33

experience of leaving and settling? These are the questions explored in this	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	368.9729766845703	33
article, which is part of a larger qualitative study of ethnic identity and sense of	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	381.36097717285156	33

(see CHAITIN, LINSTROTH, and HILLER's introductory article in this issue). [1]	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	387.7470245361328	33
This article presents analyses of interviews with six informants from among the	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	384.36097717285156	34
total sample of ten Cuban-American participants—first- and second-generation	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	384.55995178222656	34
Cuban immigrants. These six informants were chosen based on the factors of	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	379.1809844970703	34
gender, generation, and immigration pattern. In turn, we wanted to assess how	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	384.81288146972656	34
these particular characteristics influenced the experiences of these Cuban	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	361.5698699951172	34
participants. The ages of informants ranged from the mid-twenties to late-fifties,	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	388.3769073486328	34
and the sample was divided evenly between men and women. We identified	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	370.28187561035156	34
emergent themes in the biographical interviews, placed those themes within a	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	379.15882873535156	34
wider theoretical lens, and then explored our findings in relation to the sense of	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	384.9229278564453	34
home and identity. Furthermore, it should be noted our sample size was	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	350.2398223876953	34
particularly small since these were life-story interviews and our study followed	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	377.81678771972656	34

devastated by disease and forced hard labor, as occurred in other occupied	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	368.87391662597656	78

interwoven in the island's culture and language (THOMAS, 1998). African slaves	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	392.2378692626953	78

In the 1800s, the Spanish colonists looked to the authority of Madrid, but many of	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	396.24183654785156	79

two decades. The next several decades saw periods of political corruption and	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	382.06288146972656	80
instability under several governments. This instability continued until the mid 20th	144.6999969482422	659.359130859375	11.62060546875	391.36085510253906	80

Batista administration was a key factor leading to Castro's takeover of the	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	359.35877990722656	80

to Castro's rise to power. Although he had broad support initially, due to	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	349.66783142089844	84

(NACKERUD, SPRINGER, LARRISON, & ISAAC, 1999). There were four	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	359.7899932861328	86
specific "waves" of Cuban immigration into the United States: the Early Exiles	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	377.8386993408203	86

Mariel boatlift in 1980, and the Rafter Crisis in 1994, which led to the policy	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	365.05674743652344	86
known as "wet-foot, dry-foot." This policy allows Cubans to stay in the United	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	374.17579650878906	86

refugees left the island as they saw their industries nationalized. This early wave	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	391.86378479003906	87

as undesirable. Despite the labels of "criminal" and "scum" given by the press,	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	381.60084533691406	88

determined to tighten the rules regarding Cuban entry into the U.S. and thus	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	371.9757843017578	92
created the new policy (NACKERUD et al., 1999). Because of the continued	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	370.4687042236328	92

However, the reality of the situation is that more and more are economic refugees	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	398.7499542236328	92

economy. Regardless of the motivations for migration, one result of these four	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	380.80885314941406	92
waves of emigration is that a large segment of South Florida's population has	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	376.95887756347656	92
Cuban ethnic roots. Over 650,000 Cuban immigrants live in Miami-Dade County	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	389.9278106689453	92
alone. This broad Cuban community has economic and political influence in	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	368.65382385253906	92
South Florida, especially in Miami (MORENO, n.d.). [11]	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	273.14698791503906	92

We now turn to a short description of the mutual influence resulting from the	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	371.46974182128906	94
historical relationship between Cuba and the United States, a relationship that	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	379.62086486816406	94
has impacted the sense of home and belonging for Cuban immigrants. For some	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	394.1619415283203	94
two hundred years, the proximity of Cuba to southern Florida led to trade,	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	357.7967987060547	94
tourism, and commercial linkages (PEREZ, 1990). In the nineteenth century,	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	372.77882385253906	94
North Americans came to Cuba to invest in the sugar industry, while many	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	362.0318145751953	94
Cubans moved to Key West and Tampa to work in cigar factories. In the latter	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	380.42384338378906	94
half of the 1800s, wealthy Cubans traveled to North America to vacation or to	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	376.4748077392578	94
study. In the 1920s, working class Cubans came to Miami as entertainers and	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	379.35682678222656	94
workers (PEREZ, 1999). Political exiles, too, have made the short trip from Cuba	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	393.5358428955078	94
to the United States from the time of José Martí prior to independence from Spain.	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	393.10670471191406	94
Such political exile to the United States continued in the late 1920s and 1930s	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	380.11610412597656	94
and has been ongoing ever since to the present day (BENJAMIN, 1990). [12]	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	375.54701232910156	94
Following the war for Cuba's independence from Spain, the United States'	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	360.85487365722656	95
occupation of Cuba had a longstanding influence on the island. Aside from the	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	382.31593322753906	95
political ramifications, the U.S. presence left its mark on the culture and the	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	366.54176330566406	95
landscape of Cuba, as well. The period of occupation included massive	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	347.2588653564453	95
reconstruction, including the building of banks, stores, homes, and a new capitol	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	391.4130401611328	95
building all resembling U.S. architecture (PEREZ, 1999; BENJAMIN, 1990).	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	367.8616485595703	95
Meanwhile, North Americans developed a growing fascination with Cuba,	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	356.3778533935547	95
beginning in the 1920s and continuing through the 1950s, as a nearby destination	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	398.5410919189453	95
that was both exotic and tropical while maintaining old-world Spanish charm. At	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	386.08876037597656	95
the same time, as Miami grew, some neighborhoods were modeled after the style	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	397.7090606689453	95
of Havana; and hotels and housing developments were given Spanish names	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	377.67396545410156	95
(PEREZ, 1999, 1990). As a result of these mutual influences, when Cubans came	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	399.17897033691406	95

different from their own, yet at the same time not completely strange. They were	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	391.04994201660156	98
in a region filled with Spanish street and town names, where architectural styles	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	388.14588928222656	98

relatives or business associates. Thus the land of exile was at once foreign and	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	387.47499084472656	98

Before turning to our results, it is also important to discuss briefly the history of	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	383.01881408691406	100
Cuban nationalism, since this relates to the construction of Cuban identity for	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	375.22084045410156	100
both first and second generation Cuban immigrants. For the majority of Cuba's	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	383.3388214111328	100
history, the notion of Cuba Libre (Free Cuba) has been at the core of the	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0162353515625	354.10496520996094	100
imagined homeland. This democratic vision, popularized most famously by José	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	390.03785705566406	100
Martí in the fight for Cuban independence, served as the cherished dream	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	360.94300842285156	100
throughout years of colonization by Spain and occupation by the United States	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	382.70094299316406	100
prior to official statehood (BENJAMIN, 1990). Along with the establishment of the	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	394.96571350097656	100
Republic of Cuba, was the Platt Amendment, which allowed for United States'	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	378.60987854003906	100
interventionism in Cuban affairs and thereby instilled in most Cubans an	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	350.9438018798828	100
unfulfilled sense of independent-nationalism. It was not until the 1930s that	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	364.8368377685547	100
independence emerged, resulting in great national pride but short-lived	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	345.7627716064453	100
satisfaction. In the following decades, the strong-man rule of Machado and	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	364.40501403808594	100
Batista left Cubans seeking real freedom. At first, the revolution of Fidel and Raul	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	396.0988311767578	100
Castro was welcomed by many as offering hope for a democratic republic. With	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	387.8378448486328	100
the coming of the communist regime, however, many felt the dream of Cuba	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0162353515625	372.0240020751953	100
Libre remained unfulfilled. As a result, most of Cuban history has consisted of	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0162353515625	378.4798126220703	100
longing for an imagined free nation. This imagined belonging is an important part	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	394.30592346191406	100
of the continued identity that we found in our interviews with Cuban Americans.	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	384.87403869628906	100
We will see in the following analyses that the imagined homeland is a prominent	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	390.4009552001953	100
theme for both generations of Cuban immigrants. [14]	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	262.2469940185547	100

Among the six biographical interviews discussed in this article, four came from	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	381.69190979003906	103
the first generation of immigrants from Cuba. These immigrants had quite	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	359.1167449951172	103
different experiences, while their divergent views evoked distinct political eras	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	377.5307159423828	103
(ECKSTEIN & BARBERIA, 2002). Victor was a young adult when he left Cuba in	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	392.5679473876953	103
the early 1970s, having earned his visa by working several years in the sugar	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	376.3979034423828	103

immigrated to the United States in 1988 after years as a political prisoner. These	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	393.3709259033203	103

Cuba, their lives altered forever. Another interviewee, Nina, was a generation	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	375.8588409423828	103
younger and grew up in Havana under Castro's rule. She did not want to leave	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	382.50282287597656	103
Cuba, but eventually did so as a young adult when frustrated by the hardships.	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	383.3279571533203	103

This article summarizes these different lives and interprets how our biographers	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	388.6189727783203	106
conceptualize their sense of belonging in relation to their immigrant experiences	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	389.75184631347656	106
from Cuba to the United States. [16]	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	176.54701232910156	106
3.1.1 Victor's story	144.6999969482422	164.7958984375	11.0	90.62890625	107
When asked to tell his life story, Victor immediately introduced the traumatic	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	370.7216339111328	108
impact of the Castro revelation. He begins his story, "Oh, well, I was very happy	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	388.7398223876953	108
in my country until the revolution; you know; they make laws until I didn't like it,	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	383.0746612548828	108
and I have to leave my country and leave my family." Victor's thoughts return	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	374.24183654785156	108
repeatedly to the impact of Castro on his life. Speaking of his childhood, Victor	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	382.32679748535156	108
says, "It's happy, it's normal, like a child, like every child. Very, very happy with	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0162353515625	383.5380401611328	108
my family, loving parents, loving brothers and sisters." Then, after a long breath,	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	391.28089904785156	108
he says	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	37.71897888183594	108
"And we have to get separate because of the system, the new system ... I was so	167.39999389648438	321.1361083984375	10.0	357.0596618652344	109
happy. I was born in a fishing town. The ocean was very close; I like to swim, play like	167.39999389648438	335.3360900878906	10.0	376.0597839355469	109
every boy. ... Just the system changed, and everything changed you know, in my life,	167.39999389648438	349.43609619140625	10.014739990234375	372.3700256347656	109
and the life of all my family and the many families in Cuba ..." [17]	167.39999389648438	363.6361083984375	10.0	287.3699951171875	109
Victor explains that he was prohibited from pursuing abstract art, which was very	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	392.73280334472656	110
important to him. In addition, he was a practicing Catholic, and he said he was	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	381.1608428955078	110
sent to a labor camp to work in the sugar cane fields for several years because "I	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	395.51588439941406	110
was religious" and also in order to get a permit to leave the country. Victor	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	360.7007598876953	110
received a visa to Spain, and after a short time he traveled to New York City.	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	373.7027130126953	110
While he was able to see family members who had immigrated before him to the	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	392.9418487548828	110
United States, it was painful for him to leave family members behind in Cuba, as	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	391.1487579345703	110
well. Victor's experience of leaving Cuba was clearly traumatic, even though he	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	385.8358917236328	110
was not expelled from the country. As he explained, he chose to work toward	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.30230712890625	375.3050079345703	110
emigration by toiling on a sugar cane plantation for years in order to gain the	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	373.19691467285156	110
desired exit visa. Thus, he both wanted to leave and resented "having" to leave. [18]	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	394.4469757080078	110
When describing his experience as an immigrant in the United States, Victor	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	372.50379943847656	111
conveys similarly conflicted feelings.	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	176.87989807128906	111
"When I get New York, I am going to tell you the truth; I didn't like it at all. I wanted to	167.39999389648438	604.1361083984375	10.0	371.6598205566406	112
come back to Spain because New York was very different to our culture. But I have	167.39999389648438	618.3360595703125	10.0	365.5597229003906	112
my family, I have my girlfriend waiting for me, and then I decided to stay in this	167.39999389648438	632.4360961914062	10.0	343.7997741699219	112
country. That time it was hard because you don't get any help at all. ... My family help	167.39999389648438	646.6361083984375	10.0	373.2596740722656	112
me, but I like to have my own money. I started working. I work very hard. I didn't	167.39999389648438	660.736083984375	10.0	350.3697204589844	112
speak any English at all, but I got a job cleaning a bar. I have to work at five in the	167.39999389648438	674.9360961914062	10.0	358.8597106933594	112
morning and take the subway and make a change in Times Square...I got lost many	167.39999389648438	689.0361328125	10.01470947265625	368.6999816894531	112
times in that Times Square. It was very hard, but after that I got another job, I get	167.39999389648438	703.236083984375	10.0	355.0696105957031	112
married, and everything was changing. I started loving this country I love now very	167.39999389648438	717.3360595703125	10.0	359.9997863769531	112
much. And then after that I didn't like the cold weather. After four years there, we	167.39999389648438	731.5360717773438	10.0	354.0597229003906	112
came to Florida on vacation. I love this weather; I love this state, and in six month ...	167.39999389648438	745.6361083984375	10.0	368.5698547363281	112
we move over here, and I start a new life here in Florida. It's still not that easy	167.39999389648438	759.8360595703125	10.0	339.8996887207031	112
because ... you have to work and you have to pay for everything. I repeat, I start	167.39999389648438	773.9360961914062	10.014713287353516	350.2699890136719	112

Victor speaks of Cuba as "my country" and of the United States as "this country."	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	395.06495666503906	116
However his sense of belonging and home is more complex than these verbal	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	379.79701232910156	116
cues would indicate. He disliked the United States at first and found it difficult to	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	388.57472229003906	116
adjust. Nevertheless, he uses the word love several times to convey his current	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0162353515625	386.1759796142578	116
feelings for "this country." It appears that Victor harbors doubts about his choice	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	389.78492736816406	116
to leave Cuba. The emphasis on loving the United States and Florida may	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	360.7447967529297	116
indicate an effort to convince himself he made the right choice. At the same time,	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	395.50489807128906	116
it might also reflect a genuine appreciation for the positive aspects of his life in	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	381.95790100097656	116
America. Therefore, we suggest Victor experiences both seemingly contradictory	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	394.17909240722656	116
feelings simultaneously, thus leading to an ambivalent sense of belonging. [20]	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	384.3470001220703	116
3.1.2 Martin's story	144.6999969482422	306.2958984375	11.0	93.02690124511719	117
Martin was born in 1955 and is a contemporary of Victor, but he did not leave	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	376.03602600097656	118
Cuba until 1988. Martin was imprisoned for several years for his political views	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	381.61170959472656	118
prior to his emigration and he told us that he was always interested in political	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	377.79481506347656	118
issues. By the time he was 17: "the State's Security began watching me, and they	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	398.4230499267578	118
thought that I could harm the government because I thought differently, and I had	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	397.12196350097656	118
courage to stand by my principles." Knowing he was being followed and in	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	361.47080993652344	118
danger, Martin attempted to escape Cuba by sneaking onto a merchant ship. This	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	399.47608947753906	118
escape attempt failed when the captain of the ship turned him in. He was	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	355.5637969970703	118
subsequently condemned to eight years in prison. [21]	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	264.54701232910156	118
Martin explains pressure from the Catholic Church led to the liberation of many	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	384.11305236816406	119
political prisoners and he was among the fortunate ones. While he was trying to	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	388.5749053955078	119
arrange his departure from the island, he was re-arrested for both possessing	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	378.7628936767578	119
enemy propaganda and trying to escape and was sentenced to 20 years in	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	365.07899475097656	119
prison. Martin was released in 1988 due to international pressure on Cuba to	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	374.1759796142578	119
release political prisoners. Speaking of his immigration to the United States,	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	369.7757110595703	119

"I came with the illusion to be a savior ... with that desire of continuing to fight for	167.39999389648438	590.0361328125	10.0	352.6297302246094	120
Cuba's freedom, for the things that one believes in. But ... at the same time, when	167.39999389648438	604.1361083984375	10.0	358.9596862792969	120

being something he cherished. He also noted that Cubans will not have political	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	387.60682678222656	123
conversations on the phone because they have been "programmed" to believe	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	382.69007873535156	123

used to say that motherland is where you work, had freedom, and lived. Well, I don't	167.39999389648438	236.236083984375	10.01470947265625	369.0700988769531	124

Martin's reflections on Cuban identity indicated both pride and disappointment.	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	382.21693420410156	125
"I believe that us Cubans, we are a little hard to deal with, but I have never felt	167.39999389648438	321.1361083984375	10.0	342.0697326660156	126
inferior. I am seeing the people that have come not so many years ago are not the	167.39999389648438	335.3360900878906	10.0	360.9598083496094	126
same people that came here in '59. Is not the same; is a different world. [Castro]	167.39999389648438	349.43609619140625	10.0	353.0697326660156	126
wanted to create a new order. According to him ... everything that was refined or	167.39999389648438	363.6361083984375	10.0	352.3297424316406	126
everything that rich people liked or everything that was liked by the bourgeoisie was	167.39999389648438	377.736083984375	10.0	366.2998962402344	126
something nauseating, it was something bad. That's why ... all those refined things	167.39999389648438	391.93609619140625	10.0	362.1997375488281	126
went on a downward spiral because they began changing an order that was a bit	167.39999389648438	406.0361022949219	10.0	353.5697937011719	126
bourgeois to the so-called proletariat order of the workers. The women were dressed	167.39999389648438	420.236083984375	10.0	372.5597839355469	126
as militia men and would cut sugar cane and worked in construction because women	167.39999389648438	434.3360900878906	10.014739990234375	373.7599792480469	126
were the same as men. And all of that brought about a liberalization, a vulgarity, a	167.39999389648438	448.5361022949219	10.0	358.6598205566406	126
tremendous low neighborhood vulgarity ... that's why for me Cubans are not the	167.39999389648438	462.6361083984375	10.0	349.2597961425781	126
same. For example, my nephew came who an airhead, and he came with ideas...is	167.39999389648438	476.8360900878906	10.0	365.1999206542969	126
telling me things, thinking that what he was telling me I was going to see him as a	167.39999389648438	490.93609619140625	10.014739990234375	357.2599792480469	126
hero. He doesn't know that what he was telling me is that he was an idiot and that he	167.39999389648438	505.1361083984375	10.0147705078125	371.8598327636719	126
was a person that was no good that was worthless. 'Cause for me, anyone who tells	167.39999389648438	519.236083984375	10.0147705078125	368.6998596191406	126
me that he is a gigolo and all those things, I can't see those things as good ...	167.39999389648438	533.4360961914062	10.01470947265625	339.07000732421875	126
The first Cubans, they were really the wealthy Cuban class that had to flee the island,	167.39999389648438	550.6361083984375	10.0	374.4697570800781	127

previous regime. Those people ... were brilliant people—entrepreneurs, physicians,	167.39999389648438	578.9360961914062	10.0	365.0698547363281	127
etc. ... those people have a tremendous merit because they were the first that had to	167.39999389648438	593.1361083984375	10.01470947265625	370.7599182128906	127
wash dishes over here, the people whose children later on went to college. ...That is	167.39999389648438	607.236083984375	10.0	368.8998107910156	127
the old Cuban-ness ... I don't think that Cubans who come now are going to create	167.39999389648438	621.4360961914062	10.01470947265625	361.8597717285156	127
anything. It's already created. And it's an old Cuban-ness that inserted itself in a world	167.39999389648438	635.5361328125	10.01470947265625	376.5598449707031	127
of democracy, in a world of North American development, but with the spirit and the	167.39999389648438	649.736083984375	10.0147705078125	366.7599792480469	127

same Cubans that say over here, 'I go over there,' that's a lie, that's an ideal. There	167.39999389648438	678.0361328125	10.0	365.2596130371094	127
are thinkers that say that there is a Cuba in the mind; in reality, that doesn't exist	167.39999389648438	692.1361083984375	10.0	352.4696960449219	127

story in the context of the Castro revolution. Nina describes what might be called	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	392.86488342285156	131
"imagined memories." These are scenes and facts that she was too young to	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	375.57301330566406	131
recall herself, but to which she relates as if they came from firsthand experience.	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	393.28285217285156	131
"The year that I was born is called año de la ofensiva revolucionaria [the year of the	167.39999389648438	207.93609619140625	10.0	366.0599670410156	132
revolutionary offensive]. Why was it called like that? Because it is the year when the	167.39999389648438	222.1361083984375	10.0	367.5598449707031	132
last existing private businesses in Cuba are nationalized. That means that the people	167.39999389648438	236.236083984375	10.0	373.6597595214844	132

the people from that moment on work for the government. Then this means that	167.39999389648438	264.53607177734375	10.0	350.7698059082031	132
between '59 and '68 there was space for certain things which still remained, from	167.39999389648438	278.736083984375	10.0	355.0298156738281	132
before the revolution, from what was the life before. But little by little that was over	167.39999389648438	292.83612060546875	10.0	359.2296447753906	132
with. ... I was born in Hijas de Galicia, and in this clinic, the doctor who was supposed	167.39999389648438	307.03607177734375	10.0	374.8598937988281	132

attend me, because they had sent him to work in agriculture. It was not some sort of	167.39999389648438	349.43609619140625	10.0	369.1697082519531	132
punishment or anything like that, it was because, it was the time when they said that	167.39999389648438	363.6361083984375	10.0	368.6698303222656	132
everybody had to do work of the common man. So then when they put a doctor into	167.39999389648438	377.736083984375	10.0	366.1597595214844	132

"I lived in the center of Havana in a street called Amistad which is right next to the	167.39999389648438	533.4360961914062	10.0	358.2597351074219	134

similar. Well I lived four blocks away from that. And that was the house of the family	167.39999389648438	561.736083984375	10.0	367.8997497558594	134

because for me it was a normal city, but there was certain things that you still could	167.39999389648438	207.93609619140625	10.0	364.5596618652344	138
see like the places where you got in, the lobbies with marble floors. Then these things	167.39999389648438	222.1361083984375	10.0	376.2997741699219	138
started to get destroyed because the time is horrible, and if you don't maintain it ..." [27]	167.39999389648438	236.236083984375	10.0	374.4700012207031	138
Nina's story reflects both the loss of the city she loves and the loss of that city's	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	385.84681701660156	139
former glory as a result of the revolution. [28]	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	219.64698791503906	139
Nina's parents divorced during her childhood, and she remained very close to her	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	396.5280303955078	140
father. When he decided to leave Cuba, the family kept the decision a secret for	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	390.2469024658203	140
his protection. As a result, Nina experienced the shock of sudden separation	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	372.67994689941406	140
when she learned he was gone.	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	155.52894592285156	140
"In ... 1980, my father left. My father that I loved left the country in the year 1980 with	167.39999389648438	377.736083984375	10.0	370.5596618652344	141
the Mariel boatlift ... My dad and my mom had divorced a year earlier. I didn't live with	167.39999389648438	391.93609619140625	10.0	374.5598449707031	141
him, but I was very attached to him. The circumstances of the day in which my father	167.39999389648438	406.0361022949219	10.0	372.2298889160156	141
left were horrible. My father didn't tell anybody but only ... his mom and his father that	167.39999389648438	420.236083984375	10.0	372.9697570800781	141
he was leaving. He didn't tell me that he was leaving the country. So imagine, I go	167.39999389648438	434.3360900878906	10.0	358.7598571777344	141
that afternoon to see my grandmother, and then I arrived to the house and my father	167.39999389648438	448.5361022949219	10.0	370.5297546386719	141
is there. And I asked papi, what are you doing here? Well, a day of work, how	167.39999389648438	462.6361083984375	10.0	340.5198059082031	141
curious. And I sit with my father to talk with him. At that time I miss him more	167.39999389648438	476.8360900878906	10.0	336.2597351074219	141
because I don't live with him, but I continue see him. So I see that papi gives me	167.39999389648438	490.93609619140625	10.0	352.3597106933594	141
many kisses and he is rare, rare. And I thought, what is going on with him? We sat in	167.39999389648438	505.1361083984375	10.0	373.0598449707031	141
a sofa, and I told him, papi you are giving me a kiss like if you would never see me	167.39999389648438	519.236083984375	10.0	361.9598693847656	141
again. In that time the country is in convulsion...with all people who want leave and	167.39999389648438	533.4360961914062	10.0	362.1598815917969	141
others who don't. Papi has all this situation with me of kiss and kiss because...he	167.39999389648438	547.5361328125	10.0	354.9598693847656	141
knows that he is leaving, but I don't know. ... So Monday ... morning, my maternal	167.39999389648438	561.736083984375	10.0	357.1195983886719	141

Clearly, the departure of her father was painful for Nina. Her own decision to	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	372.37171936035156	142
leave Cuba was also emotional, though it was anger which prompted her resolve.	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	396.6049346923828	142
She told us she "didn't want to leave Cuba." At the same time, however, Nina was	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	398.78285217285156	142
growing increasingly frustrated over her deteriorating quality of life. Her boyfriend	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	395.13087463378906	142
predicted that economic hardship would increase with the coming of perestroika	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	389.0589141845703	142
in Russia, and he encouraged Nina to take advantage of the opportunity she had	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	394.4160919189453	142
to join her father in Florida. In fact, Nina was able to leave because her father had	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	398.9341583251953	142
gained citizenship in the United States while she was still a minor: "I decide to	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	378.46791076660156	142
leave in September of '89. The summer of '89 was very sad, very sad, very sad,	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	389.20191955566406	142
because, imagine, you separate from everything. Curiously, instead of being sad,	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	396.1209259033203	142
what I had inside was ...a big anger that I had to leave my country. A very	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	358.66578674316406	142

Nina originally thought of Miami as "horrible." However, her appreciation for the	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	385.85780334472656	146

large Cuban community in South Florida, Nina saw little need to speak English	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	382.57301330566406	146

altered her sense of Cuban identity. According to Nina, being Cuban is an	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	359.63999938964844	147

In spite of her new citizenship, Nina does not think of herself as American:	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	361.78977966308594	149

In her interview, Nina made a distinction between Cubans who emigrated from	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0162353515625	381.79396057128906	151

for those born on the island. [34]	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	158.64698791503906	151

When Daniel was 7, he came to the United States in the Mariel boatlift with his	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	382.63978576660156	153

nationalism expressed at his school. Daniel does not have direct memories of his	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	395.14186096191406	153
migration. Most of Daniel's memories have been constructed with information	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	376.5298614501953	153
received from relatives and other sources. He repeats what might be considered	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	391.65504455566406	153
the standard discourse of the exile community. For example:	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	295.05284118652344	153
"I came to this country when I was only about seven years old, so I don't have a lot of	167.39999389648438	660.736083984375	10.0	373.0698547363281	154

was raised in a land that once flourished in the 1950s. However, when I was born in	167.39999389648438	689.0361328125	10.0	367.0598449707031	154
the 1972 post-Castro era, there started to be more scarcity and less freedoms as far	167.39999389648438	703.236083984375	10.0	370.8297424316406	154

past, because his father worked as a high-level government official under Castro.	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	396.3079376220703	155

Both the sense of threat and possible shame darken the playful childhood	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	359.2929229736328	159

felt by their parents. Although the women did not identify with a sense of loss or	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	387.5459747314453	162

leave one country and move to another. This theory suggests "the 'push' of	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	365.80491638183594	198

In the stories of the Cuban immigrants analyzed for this article, we saw evidence	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	392.7658233642578	199
of pushing and pulling influences that contributed to their decisions to leave	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	367.38880920410156	199
Cuba. We suggest this duality contributed to ambivalence among our participants	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	397.0669708251953	199
regarding the phenomenon of leaving. Those who emigrated felt forced to leave	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	389.2678985595703	199
their homeland, although they were not literally expelled; this was a choice they	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	386.0668487548828	199
made to better their lives. As a result, these first generation immigrants convey	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	384.32875061035156	199
the conflicting feelings of loss over leaving a homeland, combined with the desire	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	395.46095275878906	199
to leave for a better life. They feel resentment over being "forced" to leave, but	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	382.62391662597656	199
they simultaneously feel the conflicting feeling of gratitude over having escaped	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	387.58497619628906	199
the oppressive Castro regime. For the second-generation participants, leaving is	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	391.7539825439453	199
associated with leaving the immediate family, which is strongly identified with	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	374.3296661376953	199
Cuban tradition and the Cuban community. These participants want to escape the	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	398.99195861816406	199
oppression of Cuban family expectations, while at the same time they feel the	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	378.1687774658203	199
conflicting feeling of valuing close family ties. [53]	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	240.94700622558594	199
Based on our analyses, we suggest that the push and pull theory of migration can	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	398.80494689941406	200

psychological and emotional factors. We also suggest the duality of push and pull	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	397.9250030517578	200

CHAITIN, LINSTROTH, and HILLER's article (this issue) points out why notions	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	388.00282287597656	205

significance of home varies for different generations. We draw upon this	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	351.74681091308594	205

consider the sense of home specifically among our Cuban-American biographers.	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	398.38697814941406	205
While scholars in the field of Cuban-American studies have pointed to an	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	355.84986877441406	205

communities, we argue why the immigrants themselves also feel and express	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	377.8168487548828	205
ambivalence toward feeling at home in these communities (STEPICK, GRENIER,	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	396.8687286376953	205
CASTRO & DUNN, 2003, p.11). [55]	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	177.94700622558594	205
Some scholars suggest many Cuban immigrants may no longer intend to return	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	388.3549346923828	206
to Cuba even after Castro and this means "the United States is their home, not	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	384.4168243408203	206
Cuba" (OLSEN & OLSEN, 1995, p.109). This assertion belies the stories of our	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	386.1219024658203	206
first-generation informants, who expressed much more complex and conflicted	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	382.6459503173828	206
sentiments regarding what and where home is for them. Whether or not first-	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	374.39576721191406	206

eventually do so, they may consider themselves "reluctant migrants" who	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	356.04783630371094	206
continue to view Cuba as home (PEREZ, 1992, p.93). In addition, for those	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	365.9807586669922	206
residing in Miami, the large and dominant Cuban presence makes possible a	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	374.3520050048828	206

Such an environment might be considered a liminal space—not quite Cuba, not	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	387.30995178222656	206
quite the United States. This liminality contributes to ambiguity about home. [56]	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	389.9469757080078	206
The perceptions of changes in post-revolutionary Cuba have also fostered a	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	370.73500061035156	207

immigrants. There is a belief the Castro revolution destroyed an ideal, beautiful	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	385.07691955566406	207
tropical island homeland. While the communist ideology and economic system	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	381.6439971923828	207
has transformed the "real" Cuba into a physically damaged and morally decaying	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	394.16200256347656	207
country. Of course, this "real" Cuba is an imagined construct, as one of our	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	365.91490173339844	207

often dream of a "dear, sweet homeland," a fiction non-existent in actual	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	352.20884704589844	207

Cuban identity is a topic of extreme importance for the immigrant community in	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	384.5728302001953	221
the United States. It is also a contested idea, due in part to the varying	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	343.38685607910156	221

has existed in the imagination for centuries as an unrealized dream. In light of this	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	399.4759063720703	221
unique history, Cuba has been referred to as "the elusive nation" (FERNANDEZ	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	389.3668975830078	221
& BETANCOURT, 2000, p.3). Scholars have argued why Cuban-ness itself is	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	377.8269805908203	221

(FERNANDEZ & BETANCOURT, 2000, p.8). DUANY (2000) has pointed to why	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	391.1048126220703	221
the perception of Cuban-ness is not American. CASTRO posits how the exile	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	375.43104553222656	221
community "believes that it is a repository and trustee of what is most authentic in	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	397.56190490722656	221
Cuban culture, which, in its view, has been virtually destroyed on the island by	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	380.3578643798828	221
nearly four decades of communism" (2000, p.306). This exile community	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	354.12278747558594	221
attempts to pass this Cuban culture on to the second generation, but this	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	355.3768768310547	221
construction of Cuban culture and identity does not acknowledge the inevitable	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	384.0869903564453	221
changes taking place within every culture. This is a point that MEDINA	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	342.79872131347656	221
emphasizes in pointing to the "illusion of uniqueness or singularity" of Cuban	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	372.9290313720703	221
identity, an illusion that does not take into account the diversity and contested	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	378.00392150878906	221
nature of that national identity (2007, p.3). [63]	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	226.2469940185547	221
This sense of loss brings us to the issue of trauma. VOLKAN (1991, p.13) speaks	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	398.05690002441406	222
of "chosen trauma" when referring to experiences of victimization and humiliation	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	394.5589141845703	222
as factors in the construction of a collective identity. We contend why this	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	357.00498962402344	222
conceptualization is useful in understanding various expressions of Cuban	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	361.7678985595703	222
identity. The first generation of Cuban immigrants who participated in this study	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	386.47694396972656	222
experienced trauma in the process of leaving the island, and specifically convey	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	388.83888244628906	222
how suffering is linked to Castro's regime. This trauma remained at the forefront	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	390.5658721923828	222
of their construction of their own identities; indeed it was the first thing they	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	364.5429229736328	222
mentioned when they began telling the stories of their lives. While it is	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	340.5376434326172	222
understandable any trauma would leave a permanent impression in someone's	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	384.54896545410156	222
consciousness, these immigrants chose to identify with this political trauma. It	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	378.2676544189453	222
appears to be a unifying element of Cuban exiles in South Florida for creating	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	378.2898712158203	222
communal identity. The first-generation immigrants chose to maintain this trauma	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	395.8239288330078	222

& ITZKOWITZ, 2000, p.233). The notion of second-generation "remembering,"	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	383.6470489501953	225

stories and memories (HERRERA, 2007). The theory of long distance nationalism	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	398.8928985595703	225
supports this notion, proposing "an ideology of belonging that extends across the	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	394.8119659423828	225

formation of a pan-Hispanic identity. While the older first-generation immigrants	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	387.6287384033203	228
