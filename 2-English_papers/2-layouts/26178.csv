The paper analyzes the radical right‘s attitudes toward the EU focusing in particular on the	113.41999816894531	143.85589599609375	9.9599609375	410.97886657714844	21
level of congruence between the programmatic statements of the central office and the	113.41999816894531	159.33587646484375	9.9599609375	410.65098571777344	21
voting behavior of their MEPs. It shows that although radical right parties represent a source	113.41999816894531	174.81585693359375	9.9599609375	410.61399841308594	21
of opposition to the EU, within the EP they express their dissent making use of the rules of	113.41999816894531	190.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.58311462402344	21
the game, voting with the opposition more than the other forces do, but voting almost as	113.41999816894531	205.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.71067810058594	21
much with the majority. The party public office in the EP is inserted in the legislative process	113.41999816894531	221.255859375	9.9599609375	410.4654998779297	21
and even more collusive with the other parties of both sides of the political spectrum than the	113.41999816894531	236.85589599609375	9.9599609375	410.6593475341797	21
Eurosceptical rhetoric and statements of central office makes the public believe.	113.41999816894531	252.3658447265625	9.9599609375	352.88890075683594	21

Many studies show that Euroscepticism has become an ideological pillar of radical right	113.41999816894531	143.85589599609375	9.9599609375	410.7875213623047	34
parties. It is a theme that has acquired greater salience within the political discourse of this	113.41999816894531	159.33587646484375	9.9599609375	410.3821258544922	34
area, to the point that these parties have become the main stronghold of EU-pessimism	113.41999816894531	174.81585693359375	9.9599609375	410.94126892089844	34
(Mudde 2007). Particularly, their political discourse has largely internalized the EU issue,	113.41999816894531	190.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.65171813964844	34
making the radical right the political area where this issue has become more salient (Kriesi	113.41999816894531	205.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.53135681152344	34
2007). In this paper, I analyze the radical right‘s attitudes toward the EU focusing in particular	113.41999816894531	221.255859375	9.9599609375	411.03428649902344	34

their MEPs. Notably, the aim of the paper is to describe the problem along the following	113.41999816894531	252.3658447265625	9.9599609375	410.96873474121094	34

It is an approach that aims at integrating several dimensions of party attitudes toward the EU	113.41999816894531	385.2058410644531	9.96002197265625	410.48411560058594	36
examined by earlier studies, such as the dimension of the political discourse that was	113.41999816894531	400.68585205078125	9.96002197265625	410.4816131591797	36
examined through the party manifestos for the European elections (Gabel & Hix 2004), and	113.41999816894531	416.18585205078125	9.96002197265625	411.0255584716797	36
of the institutional behavior of politicians that was examined through the voting behavior of	113.41999816894531	431.66583251953125	9.96002197265625	410.29234313964844	36
MEPs (Hix et al. 2007). In sum, through the analysis of party Euromanifestos and roll-call	113.41999816894531	447.2658386230469	9.96002197265625	411.1096649169922	36
votes in the European Parliament, I will produce a description of what radical right parties	113.41999816894531	462.745849609375	9.96002197265625	410.7299041748047	36
say about Europe, what their MEPs do in order to translate the party rhetoric into concrete	113.41999816894531	478.2113037109375	9.97454833984375	410.66258239746094	36
political action, and how congruent these two dimensions of the party stance on the EU are.	113.41999816894531	493.6913146972656	9.97454833984375	404.5120086669922	36
From the theoretical point of view, the paper will contribute to understanding politics and the	113.41999816894531	524.7858276367188	9.96002197265625	410.67222595214844	37
behavior of the radical right in different ways. Firstly, the results of the comparative analysis	113.41999816894531	540.2658081054688	9.96002197265625	410.43174743652344	37
will allow us to determine whether the radical right behaves cohesively enough to present the	113.41999816894531	555.8658447265625	9.96002197265625	410.5115203857422	37
character of a real party family. Or, alternatively, it will determine whether the empirical	113.41999816894531	571.3458862304688	9.96002197265625	410.68223571777344	37
evidence supports the argument – maintained by the founder of the German Republicans	113.41999816894531	586.8558349609375	9.959991455078125	410.76683044433594	37
Franz Schönhuber among others (in Mudde 2007: 159) – that a genuine European radical	113.41999816894531	602.3358154296875	9.959991455078125	410.8682098388672	37

Secondly, assessing the level of congruence between the attitudes of different faces of party	113.41999816894531	649.675048828125	9.0	410.69114685058594	38
organization is a relevant problem that current research has just started to address (Conti, Cotta &	113.41999816894531	665.2750244140625	9.0	410.49900817871094	38
Tavares de Almeida 2010). Particularly, assessing the extent to which the official party stance on the	113.41999816894531	680.7550659179688	9.0	410.7483367919922	38
EU overlaps with that of party officials holding public office is meaningful for a comprehensive	113.41999816894531	696.2350463867188	9.0	410.62522888183594	38
understanding of the broad phenomenon of party attitudes toward the EU. Recent research shows that	113.41999816894531	711.7150268554688	9.000007629394531	411.1429901123047	38
citizens are way less pro-European than politicians (Best, Lengyel & Verzichelli forthcoming). Given the	113.41999816894531	727.195068359375	9.0	410.7781219482422	38
gap in the support for the EU between citizens and politicians, it is particularly relevant to study	113.41999816894531	742.6710205078125	9.0	411.08006286621094	38

In order to analyze the attitudes of radical right parties toward the EU and to describe the	113.41999816894531	162.81585693359375	9.9599609375	410.79197692871094	45
main components of these attitudes (dissatisfaction with the defense of national interests,	113.41999816894531	178.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.5415496826172	45
opposition to EU policies, protest against loss of sovereignty) I will examine the party	113.41999816894531	193.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.7602996826172	45
positions on a set of specific issues. I will start my analysis with a study of party	113.41999816894531	209.255859375	9.9599609375	410.85508728027344	45
Euromanifestos, the programs that the national parties present for the EP elections. These	113.41999816894531	224.85589599609375	9.9599609375	410.48155212402344	45
documents provide a useful representation of the ideological structure and of the policy	113.41999816894531	240.33587646484375	9.9599609375	410.6509246826172	45
preferences of parties. Radical parties tend to have a particularly good electoral performance	113.41999816894531	255.84588623046875	9.9599609375	410.68577575683594	45
at the EP elections given the second-order nature of the scrutiny, and thanks to the PR	113.41999816894531	271.32586669921875	9.9599609375	410.6790008544922	45
nature of the electoral system. Their visibility in these elections tends to be high and their	113.41999816894531	286.80584716796875	9.9599609375	410.83702087402344	45
programmatic assertiveness is consequently also high. It is important to note that	113.41999816894531	302.285888671875	9.9599609375	410.58128356933594	45
Euromanifestos are usually issued by the party central office and they present the overall	113.41999816894531	317.8858642578125	9.9599609375	410.52146911621094	45
party line for use with the party rank and file and with the electorate. Thus, these documents	113.41999816894531	333.3658447265625	9.96002197265625	410.89622497558594	45
reflect a unitary vision of the party and do not offer much evidence of any eventual intra-party	113.41999816894531	348.8458557128906	9.96002197265625	411.1101531982422	45
division. This limitation that is intrinsic to any manifesto analysis is also the starting point for	113.41999816894531	364.3258361816406	9.96002197265625	410.4119110107422	45
an interesting research question: Is a party cohesive enough in its stance on the EU? As was	113.41999816894531	379.80584716796875	9.96002197265625	410.5898895263672	45
mentioned in the introduction, this paper begins to address the problem by means of a	113.41999816894531	395.28582763671875	9.96002197265625	410.73045349121094	45
comparison between the analysis of party manifestos that I present in this section, and that	113.41999816894531	410.8858337402344	9.96002197265625	410.5314178466797	45

Given the level of complexity and the increasing number of policy areas where the EU is involved, it	113.41999816894531	458.24505615234375	9.0	410.61607360839844	46
seems useful to break-down party attitudes across many aspects of European integration. This attempt	113.41999816894531	473.72503662109375	9.0	411.09507751464844	46
allows for a disentanglement of party attitudes across different dimensions of the EU process and a	113.41999816894531	489.2050476074219	9.0	410.64305114746094	46
determination whether the same stance is confirmed across such dimensions. For this purpose, I will	113.41999816894531	504.8050537109375	9.0	410.60716247558594	46
focus the analysis in particular on the dimensions of representation and policy. It is a research strategy	113.41999816894531	520.2719116210938	9.01312255859375	411.0861053466797	46
that aims at including several functional aspects of supranational integration in the analysis. In the	113.41999816894531	535.7650146484375	9.0	410.5532684326172	46

The data base used for this part of the analysis was created by the IntUne project.1 A group	113.41999816894531	107.0804443359375	12.1754150390625	411.0902557373047	78
of national experts coded 298 Euromanifestos2 of all political areas in fifteen member states.3	113.41999816894531	122.56048583984375	12.17535400390625	411.0829315185547	78
Although these documents refer to the 1979-2004 period, the large majority actually refer to	113.41999816894531	140.255859375	9.9599609375	410.63841247558594	78
1994-2004.4 One could claim that parties may have changed their attitudes over this period.	113.41999816894531	153.64044189453125	12.1754150390625	410.7656707763672	78
In fact, this does not seem to be the case for radical parties, as the empirical analysis has	113.41999816894531	171.33587646484375	9.9599609375	410.47166442871094	78
already shown that a change in the attitudes toward the EU can be found mainly in the	113.41999816894531	186.81585693359375	9.9599609375	410.4119110107422	78
moderate parties (Gabel & Hix 2004). On the contrary, radical parties are not inclined to	113.41999816894531	202.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.70262145996094	78
change their attitudes on the EU, they tend instead to be rather stable in their opposition	113.41999816894531	217.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.5913543701172	78
(Szcerbiack & Taggart 2003, 2008) that, over time, has only become more salient, especially	113.41999816894531	233.255859375	9.9599609375	410.5713348388672	78
in the case of the radical right (Kriesi 2007). We expect, therefore, variations across time to	113.41999816894531	248.8858642578125	9.9599609375	410.66722106933594	78
be quite limited in scope, but I will report them anyway when they are deemed relevant.	113.41999816894531	264.3658447265625	9.9599609375	384.91432189941406	78
The analysis starts with an examination of the level of occurrence of the selected themes	113.41999816894531	295.44586181640625	9.9599609375	410.68077087402344	79
within the Euromanifestos. In table 2, we find evidence of the fact that, in their documents	113.41999816894531	310.92584228515625	9.9599609375	410.68077087402344	79
radical parties generally refer to such themes as often as (or even more often than)	113.41999816894531	326.4058837890625	9.959991455078125	410.4816131591797	79
mainstream parties do. Certainly, the table does not contain any information about the	113.41999816894531	342.0058288574219	9.96002197265625	411.00437927246094	79
direction of the positions expressed on the specific issues in the documents. However, it was	113.41999816894531	357.48583984375	9.96002197265625	410.3321990966797	79
relevant to find confirmation that the analyzed themes do play an important role in the party	113.41999816894531	372.9658508300781	9.96002197265625	410.73045349121094	79
discourse on the EU. They are important components of the party stance on the EU.	113.41999816894531	388.4458312988281	9.96002197265625	410.8273162841797	79
Although across parties some differences can be found in terms of frequency of occurrence,	113.41999816894531	403.92584228515625	9.96002197265625	410.45188903808594	79
overall, the selected themes recurred frequently in the Euromanifestos (in between 51.7 and	113.41999816894531	419.42584228515625	9.96002197265625	410.51170349121094	79
88.8 per cent of Euromanifestos, depending on the theme). Hence, we can be confident that	113.41999816894531	435.0258483886719	9.96002197265625	410.7632293701172	79
they represent good empirical referents for the analysis of party attitudes toward the EU as	113.41999816894531	450.5058288574219	9.96002197265625	410.43186950683594	79
they really structured the programmatic supply provided in the Euromanifestos.	113.41999816894531	465.98583984375	9.96002197265625	348.2913055419922	79

The analysis moves now to a more in-depth examination of the direction of party positions.	70.94400024414062	293.8858642578125	9.9599609375	410.6564025878906	92
For this purpose, I applied multinomial logistic regression models for the analysis of the	70.94400024414062	309.3658447265625	9.9599609375	410.5415344238281	92
content analytic variables drawn from the Euromanifestos. This technique allowed me to	70.94400024414062	324.84588623046875	9.959991455078125	411.0141906738281	92
estimate the likelihood for radical parties to express Eurosceptical positions as compared to	70.94400024414062	340.4458312988281	9.96002197265625	410.57122802734375	92
mainstream parties. Subsequently, within the radical party category I separated left from	70.94400024414062	355.92584228515625	9.96002197265625	410.4317626953125	92
right. The comparison of attitudes between parties of different ideological orientations allows	70.94400024414062	371.4058532714844	9.96002197265625	410.6907043457031	92
us to understand the phenomenon of Euroscepticism comparatively and to insert these	70.94400024414062	386.8858337402344	9.96002197265625	410.521484375	92
attitudes within the broader context of inter-party competition and of contestation of the EU	70.94400024414062	402.3658447265625	9.96002197265625	410.49859619140625	92
issue. Precisely, multinomial logistic regression models estimate the likelihood of different	70.94400024414062	417.8658447265625	9.96002197265625	410.82537841796875	92
cases to belong to each category of the dependent variable when compared to a reference	70.94400024414062	433.4658508300781	9.96002197265625	410.5413513183594	92
category. For example, in table 3, the ExpB coefficient estimates the likelihood of each	70.94400024414062	448.9458312988281	9.96002197265625	410.581298828125	92
category of the dependent variable ‗membership‘ to occur compared to the reference	70.94400024414062	464.42584228515625	9.96002197265625	410.7975158691406	92
category ‗favourable opportunities‘. In other words, the model estimates how likely it is to find	70.94400024414062	479.9058532714844	9.96002197265625	410.4815979003906	92
in the Euromanifestos (of the mainstream and radical parties respectively) ‗no reference‘, a	70.94400024414062	495.3858337402344	9.96002197265625	410.3721008300781	92
‗mixed‘ or a ‗negative‘ evaluation of the country membership, compared to the reference	70.94400024414062	510.8658447265625	9.96002197265625	410.4798278808594	92
category ‗favourable opportunities‘. I found that in their Euromanifestos, radical parties have	70.94400024414062	526.4658813476562	9.96002197265625	410.5213928222656	92
almost eleven times (ExpB=10.75) greater a likelihood to represent membership as a	70.94400024414062	541.9458618164062	9.96002197265625	410.9737548828125	92
negative constraint than to represent it as a positive opportunity. On the contrary, such	70.94400024414062	557.4258422851562	9.96002197265625	410.3919982910156	92
likelihood is almost null (ExpB=0.2) for mainstream parties.5 In particular, I found that 70% of	70.94400024414062	570.6904296875	12.1754150390625	410.924560546875	92
the Euromanifestos of the radical right (and 64.7% of those of the radical left) expressed a	70.94400024414062	588.4158935546875	9.959991455078125	410.9394226074219	92
negative evaluation of the country membership. Consequently, the expectation of a broad	70.94400024414062	603.8958740234375	9.959991455078125	410.4917297363281	92
Eurosceptism rooted in the radical parties is confirmed by the data.	70.94400024414062	619.495849609375	9.959991455078125	295.27423095703125	92
5 I considered mainstream parties to be those belonging to the following party families: Christian democrats,	70.94400024414062	713.729248046875	9.565025329589844	410.71099853515625	93

With this negative evaluation of membership on the side of radical parties follows their strong emphasis	113.41999816894531	385.3850402832031	9.0	410.59800720214844	109
on the necessity for the national government to oppose decisions at the EU level that could constrain	113.41999816894531	400.86505126953125	9.0	410.58921813964844	109
the member states. In order to find evidence of this, I analyzed how parties think the national	113.41999816894531	416.36505126953125	9.0	410.7541961669922	109
government should behave in the EU arena. In table 4, ‗defence/rejection‘ is the reference category. I	113.41999816894531	431.84503173828125	9.0	410.6072235107422	109
found that mainstream parties are eight times (ExpB=8.18) more likely to express a preference for a	113.41999816894531	447.3250427246094	9.0	411.14903259277344	109
cooperative behavior, thus for an acquiescent conduct of the national government. Furthermore, they	113.41999816894531	462.79193115234375	9.01312255859375	410.9642791748047	109
are over five times more likely (ExpB=5.63) to prefer the leadership of the national government within	113.41999816894531	478.4050598144531	9.0	410.55320739746094	109
the EU arena, hence to be in favor of a voice option. In the end, as it was easy to predict, mainstream	113.41999816894531	493.8719177246094	9.01312255859375	410.82017517089844	109
parties are divided on the assertiveness and the role that the national government should have within	113.41999816894531	509.36505126953125	9.0	410.5981903076172	109
the EU. On the contrary, the category of radical parties is more focused on the ‗defence/rejection‘	113.41999816894531	524.8450317382812	9.0	411.1580047607422	109
solution, while the likelihood for the Euromanifestos of these parties to fall in any other category is not	113.41999816894531	540.3250732421875	9.0	410.58921813964844	109
significant.6 However, it is important to highlight the differences in the attitudes of the two extremes.	113.41999816894531	553.6800537109375	11.125	410.6551971435547	109
The ‗defence/rejection‘ category occurs in 43.3% of Euromanifestos of radical right parties as	113.41999816894531	571.405029296875	9.0	410.77537536621094	109
compared to 6.7% of those of the radical left whose most recurrent category (38.2%) is instead that of	113.41999816894531	586.9150390625	9.0	411.1071014404297	109
cooperation7 (occurring in only 6.7% of Euromanifestos of the radical right). These results show that,	113.41999816894531	600.27001953125	11.125	411.1670379638672	109
although Euroscepticism is deeply rooted in the radical parties under the form of a broad attitude, for	113.41999816894531	617.8750610351562	9.0	410.5443572998047	109
instance when they evaluate country membership, when we break-down the broad stance into more	113.41999816894531	633.3550415039062	9.0	410.98411560058594	109
specific attitudes we find that Euroscepticism is definitely more pronounced in the radical right.	113.41999816894531	648.8350830078125	9.0	374.67616271972656	109
6 Changing the reference category does not change the result, as radical parties have a tendency to concentrate	113.41999816894531	724.7692260742188	9.565025329589844	410.75804138183594	110

Moving the analysis to the policy dimension, we find the same pattern. In particular, we find	70.94400024414062	413.18585205078125	9.96002197265625	410.9123840332031	126
the same tendency for attitudes toward foreign and defense policy. In table 5, mainstream	70.94400024414062	428.66583251953125	9.96002197265625	410.5014343261719	126
parties show 9.9 and 9.2 times greater likelihood respectively for the exclusive EU	70.94400024414062	444.1458435058594	9.96002197265625	410.7373046875	126
competence and a shared EU-national competence, as compared to the reference category	70.94400024414062	459.6258544921875	9.96002197265625	410.888671875	126
of the exclusive national competence. So, mainstream parties are rather divided in terms of	70.94400024414062	475.225830078125	9.96002197265625	410.5016784667969	126
degree of involvement of the EU in foreign policy, something that could explain the difficulties	70.94400024414062	490.7058410644531	9.96002197265625	410.4018859863281	126
in integrating the ex-Second Pillar of the EU. However, they agree overwhelmingly on some	70.94400024414062	506.18585205078125	9.96002197265625	410.8360900878906	126
kind of involvement of the EU, while they voice a preference for the exclusive national	70.94400024414062	521.6658325195312	9.96002197265625	410.5911865234375	126
competence only very rarely. The same tendency can be found for defense policy (tab. 6) as	70.94400024414062	537.1458129882812	9.96002197265625	410.3721923828125	126
the preference of mainstream parties for the exclusive European competence and for the	70.94400024414062	552.6258544921875	9.96002197265625	410.5916748046875	126
shared EU-national competence is 12.3 and 10.3 times greater than for the reference	70.94400024414062	568.225830078125	9.96002197265625	410.6612854003906	126
category of exclusive national competence. For both policies, values for the radical parties	70.94400024414062	583.73583984375	9.960006713867188	410.4317932128906	126
are instead not significant. The reason can be found in the dispersion of their preferences	70.94400024414062	599.2158203125	9.959991455078125	410.56304931640625	126
across different categories. Dispersion occurs between radical left and radical right, as well	70.94400024414062	614.6959228515625	9.959991455078125	410.55126953125	126
as across countries. Overall, the preference of radical parties for the exclusive national	70.94400024414062	630.1759033203125	9.959991455078125	410.9028625488281	126
competence exceeds that for any other option. They voice this sovereignist stance in foreign	70.94400024414062	645.6558837890625	9.959991455078125	410.4716491699219	126
and defense policy in 27% and 25% of their Euromanifestos respectively, without any	70.94400024414062	661.255859375	9.959991455078125	410.6807556152344	126
particular distinction between left and right. However, somewhat unexpectedly, the share for	70.94400024414062	676.73583984375	9.959991455078125	410.99810791015625	126
the other categories is also similar. Notably, over time the radical left – but not the radical	70.94400024414062	692.2158203125	9.959991455078125	410.8926696777344	126
right – becomes more supportive of the EU competence, until a peak in 2004 when 66.6% of	70.94400024414062	707.6958618164062	9.960006713867188	410.53125	126

the Euromanifestos of the radical left supports the EU competence (either exclusive or	113.41999816894531	109.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.8009490966797	128

In sum, differences between mainstream and radical parties are remarkable since the EU involvement	113.41999816894531	156.75506591796875	9.0	410.58909606933594	129
in these two policy areas is much less popular with radical parties. However, only a minority of radical	113.41999816894531	172.23504638671875	9.0	410.78611755371094	129
parties rejects the EU involvement in principle, while on this issue the radical left has become	113.41999816894531	187.71502685546875	9.0	410.65220642089844	129
increasingly aligned with mainstream parties over time. In the end, the radical right is the main	113.41999816894531	203.195068359375	9.0	410.6072235107422	129
stronghold of opposition against the communitarisation of foreign and defense policy. However, even	113.41999816894531	218.675048828125	9.0	410.4933319091797	129
for these parties, Euroscepticism is not absolute. Although integration of these policies deeply	113.41999816894531	234.155029296875	9.0	410.74205017089844	129
challenges one of the core values of the radical right, namely the defense of national sovereignty, its	113.41999816894531	249.7850341796875	9.0	410.9152069091797	129
national components are divided on what is the best level of competence. In some countries, radical	113.41999816894531	265.26507568359375	9.0	410.48118591308594	129
right parties support some EU competence in foreign and defense policy9 as they see the EU as a	113.41999816894531	278.62005615234375	11.125	411.01719665527344	129
potential barrier against globalization and U.S dominance that they oppose more fiercely: against both	113.41999816894531	296.22503662109375	9.0	410.7541961669922	129
forces, any national scale action would be powerless, especially from countries of small size or	113.41999816894531	311.70501708984375	9.0	410.66099548339844	129
reduced strategic power. Ultimately, although at various degrees and certainly more to the left than to	113.41999816894531	327.18505859375	9.0	411.03221130371094	129
the right, the EU has acquired some legitimacy as a level of governance even within the programmatic	113.41999816894531	342.7850341796875	9.0	410.50840759277344	129

We move now to the analysis of immigration policy. On the one hand, the likelihood of a	70.94400024414062	378.0058288574219	9.96002197265625	410.6109924316406	159
preference for the exclusive EU competence or the shared EU-national competence on the	70.94400024414062	393.6058349609375	9.96002197265625	410.9978942871094	159
side of mainstream parties is almost eight (ExpB=7.75) and five (ExpB=5.13) times greater	70.94400024414062	409.0858459472656	9.96002197265625	410.5215148925781	159
than it is for exclusive national competence (reference category). However, a lack of	70.94400024414062	424.5858459472656	9.96002197265625	410.61114501953125	159
reference to immigration issues is the most likely possibility for mainstream parties	70.94400024414062	440.0658264160156	9.96002197265625	411.0120544433594	159
(ExpB=14.38). On the other hand, the preferences of radical parties are again dispersed	70.94400024414062	455.54583740234375	9.96002197265625	410.50146484375	159
among different categories. Even more than for foreign and defense policy, such dispersion	70.94400024414062	471.0258483886719	9.96002197265625	410.6509094238281	159
is to be attributed mainly to the radical left. As a matter of fact, the position of radical right	70.94400024414062	486.6258544921875	9.96002197265625	410.6435546875	159
parties is more univocal as 42.9% of their Euromanfestos support the exclusive national	70.94400024414062	502.1058349609375	9.96002197265625	410.3323669433594	159
competence in immigration policy. It is evidence of the fact that radical right parties make	70.94400024414062	517.5858764648438	9.96002197265625	410.75048828125	159
their programmatic supply on this issue very distinctive from that of the other parties and	70.94400024414062	533.0658569335938	9.96002197265625	410.66015625	159
characterize their stance along the lines of a more openly nationalistic posture. Although less	70.94400024414062	548.5458374023438	9.96002197265625	410.4219665527344	159
than half of the Euromanifestos of the radical right really favor the most nationalistic solution,	70.94400024414062	564.0258178710938	9.96002197265625	411.08489990234375	159
the other more recurrent category is the no reference one, especially in the new member	70.94400024414062	579.611328125	9.974517822265625	410.8402404785156	159
states10, while a preference for the EU involvement in the immigration policy is only residual	70.94400024414062	592.92041015625	12.175445556640625	410.4834899902344	159

To conclude this part of the analysis, I can summarize that I found confirmation of the fact	113.41999816894531	378.0058288574219	9.96002197265625	410.71092224121094	176
that the radical right is the main stronghold of party-based Euroscepticism. However, this	113.41999816894531	393.6058349609375	9.96002197265625	410.8452606201172	176
attitude is broad more than it is absolute, and most importantly, it is not univocal across the	113.41999816894531	409.0858459472656	9.96002197265625	410.49009704589844	176
European countries. Although still very criticized, the EU has acquired legitimacy by radical	113.41999816894531	424.5858459472656	9.96002197265625	410.3621063232422	176
right parties in some member states where its role as a policy-maker is relatively welcome.	113.41999816894531	440.0658264160156	9.96002197265625	411.09141540527344	176
The very existence of the EU is therefore not questioned by these parties. The	113.41999816894531	455.54583740234375	9.96002197265625	410.5414276123047	176
Euroscepticism of the radical right is still quite strident, especially if one compares their	113.41999816894531	471.0258483886719	9.96002197265625	410.47166442871094	176
attitudes to those of mainstream parties and even of radical left parties whose opposition	113.41999816894531	486.6258544921875	9.96002197265625	410.90525817871094	176
against the EU has become more nuanced over time. Still, it would be difficult to talk about a	113.41999816894531	502.1058349609375	9.96002197265625	410.4717254638672	176
principled opposition of the radical right against the EU when parties are so divided about the	113.41999816894531	517.5858764648438	9.96002197265625	410.54136657714844	176
role the EU should play in the European system of governance.	113.41999816894531	533.0658569335938	9.96002197265625	280.1298065185547	176

The paper now moves to the analysis of the institutional behavior of the MEPs of the radical	70.94400024414062	162.81585693359375	9.9599609375	410.35223388671875	186
right. Specifically, I will examine whether they vote cohesively within the EP. As a matter of	70.94400024414062	178.2958984375	9.9599609375	411.04412841796875	186
fact, in the previous section it has already been shown that the programmatic supply of the	70.94400024414062	193.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.3721618652344	186
radical right is characterized by some common positions, as well as by some important	70.94400024414062	209.255859375	9.9599609375	410.5513610839844	186
differences. We now investigate whether these differences also translate into a diverse	70.94400024414062	224.85589599609375	9.9599609375	410.86065673828125	186
behavior of radical right MEPs within the EP. In addition, this part of the analysis allows us to	70.94400024414062	240.33587646484375	9.9599609375	410.52142333984375	186
shed a light on the problem of the level of coherence existing between the protest-based	70.94400024414062	255.84588623046875	9.9599609375	410.9770202636719	186

positions that, as we have seen, are not so much opposed to the EU) and their institutional	70.94400024414062	286.80584716796875	9.9599609375	410.5015563964844	186
behavior after the elections.	70.94400024414062	302.285888671875	9.9599609375	122.79682922363281	186
For the analysis, I have selected the EP group ‗Independence/Democracy‘ (IND/DEM) of the	70.94400024414062	333.48583984375	9.96002197265625	411.0937194824219	187
2004-2009 legislature. The group was created in 2004, when parties from the Eurosceptical	70.94400024414062	348.9658508300781	9.96002197265625	410.6734313964844	187
‗Europe of Democracy and Diversities‘ group made an alliance with some parties from the	70.94400024414062	364.4458312988281	9.96002197265625	410.80035400390625	187
new member states. The most important parties of IND/DEM were the following12: the UK	70.94400024414062	377.7104187011719	12.175445556640625	410.9407653808594	187
Independence Party (UKIP), the League of Polish Families, the Italian Northern League	70.94400024414062	395.4058532714844	9.96002197265625	410.461669921875	187
(suspended in 2006 and then expelled from the group after the scandal of the t-shirt worn by	70.94400024414062	411.0058288574219	9.96002197265625	411.04608154296875	187
the party member Calderoli showing anti-Islamic cartoons), and the Movement for France.	70.94400024414062	426.5058288574219	9.96002197265625	410.96356201171875	187
Additionally, some MEPs from Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Netherlands and	70.94400024414062	441.98583984375	9.96002197265625	410.49151611328125	187
Sweden also took part in the group. However, other important radical right parties such as	70.94400024414062	457.4658508300781	9.96002197265625	410.5513610839844	187
the French Front National and the Vlaams Belang did not join IND/DEM and decided instead	70.94400024414062	472.9458312988281	9.96002197265625	410.938232421875	187
to belong to the ‗Non Attached‘ group. By the end of the legislature, especially after the	70.94400024414062	488.42584228515625	9.96002197265625	410.6309509277344	187
expulsion of the Northern League, the group could rely on just 2.8 per cent of the seats in the	70.94400024414062	504.02581787109375	9.96002197265625	410.4019470214844	187
EP. Definitely, this lack of unity within the EP of radical right parties gives evidence of a lack	70.94400024414062	519.5057983398438	9.96002197265625	410.4986267089844	187
of cohesion of their intents and strategy. So the argument of whether they could be	70.94400024414062	534.98583984375	9.96002197265625	410.4915466308594	187
considered a genuine party family finds negative evidence here. At least, these parties are	70.94400024414062	550.4658813476562	9.96002197265625	410.4517822265625	187
not transnationally organized as most other party families are and this, in turn, creates an	70.94400024414062	565.9458618164062	9.96002197265625	410.6681823730469	187
impediment for the establishment of greater coherence of action within this political area.	70.94400024414062	581.455810546875	9.960006713867188	410.41204833984375	187
This lack of transnational organization also creates a problem for the analysis carried in this	70.94400024414062	597.055908203125	9.959991455078125	410.8785095214844	187
paper: due to dispersion of the radical right MEPs in various groups, any result on IND/DEM	70.94400024414062	612.535888671875	9.959991455078125	410.5512390136719	187
only partially represents the radical right as a whole. Furthermore, the empirical referent	70.94400024414062	628.015869140625	9.959991455078125	410.5711669921875	187
considered in the two parts of the analysis is not identical, as the Euromanifesto data	70.94400024414062	643.495849609375	9.959991455078125	411.0006103515625	187
examined in the previous section referred to a larger number of radical right parties than the	70.94400024414062	658.975830078125	9.959991455078125	410.3721618652344	187
data on the voting behavior of the MEPs of Independence/Democracy. However, I will show	70.94400024414062	674.455810546875	9.959991455078125	410.9074401855469	187
that in spite of these limitations, it is still possible to produce some considerations and to	70.94400024414062	690.055908203125	9.959991455078125	410.7956848144531	187

The first problem that I am going to explore concerns the internal cohesion within IND/DEM.	113.41999816894531	109.2958984375	9.9599609375	411.08885192871094	190
For this purpose, in table 8 I have reported a measurement elaborated by Hix and Noury of	113.41999816894531	124.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.7703094482422	190
the internal cohesion of the EP groups in the period 2004-2009 based on the roll-call votes	113.41999816894531	140.255859375	9.9599609375	410.84983825683594	190
(all data in this section are available on-line at http://www.votewatch.eu).13 It clearly emerged	113.41999816894531	153.64044189453125	12.1754150390625	411.15928649902344	190
that within the EP context, IND/DEM was the group with lower internal cohesion,	113.41999816894531	171.33587646484375	9.9599609375	410.69993591308594	190
comparatively as low as the Non-Attached group. To be more precise, their level of cohesion	113.41999816894531	186.81585693359375	9.9599609375	410.67710876464844	190
was about half the average level (0.8) of all party groups with the exclusion of IND/DEM and	113.41999816894531	202.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.98301696777344	190
the Non-Attached. On the other extreme of the political spectrum, the European United	113.41999816894531	217.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.51487731933594	190
Left/Nordic Green Left group (GUE-NGL) showed a level of internal cohesion in line with the	113.41999816894531	233.255859375	9.9599609375	410.6998748779297	190
above mentioned average. Hence, the radical right was internally divided along its national	113.41999816894531	248.8858642578125	9.9599609375	410.9178924560547	190
components much more than any other group of the EP was. Indeed, we only need to recall	113.41999816894531	264.3658447265625	9.9599609375	410.79002380371094	190
that some ideological diversity also emerged in the Euromanifesto analysis, but strikingly	113.41999816894531	279.84588623046875	9.9599609375	410.7504119873047	190
wide divisions emerged in the way the radical right MEPs voted in the EP. It is interesting to	113.41999816894531	295.32586669921875	9.9599609375	410.7324676513672	190

Precisely, among the parties in this group, the UKIP voted against the party line one out of	113.41999816894531	466.1058349609375	9.96002197265625	410.46177673339844	195
three times and the League of Polish Families one out of five.14 Hence, among the larger	113.41999816894531	479.37042236328125	12.175445556640625	410.84300231933594	195

party line. However, its defection rate of one fifth should not be ignored and it is the sign of a	113.41999816894531	512.5458374023438	9.96002197265625	410.49156188964844	195
rather undisciplined conduct and lack of leadership within the political group. Since we	113.41999816894531	528.0258178710938	9.96002197265625	410.39207458496094	195
registered an extremely low level of internal cohesion, this could not be explained by the	113.41999816894531	543.6258544921875	9.96002197265625	410.60081481933594	195
defections of the British and the Polish MEPS alone. It follows that the other MEPs of the	113.41999816894531	559.1058349609375	9.96002197265625	410.56126403808594	195
group representing even smaller parties have all together defected the party line more	113.41999816894531	574.5858764648438	9.96002197265625	410.6909637451172	195

in favour, N = nr. of votes against and A = nr. of abstentions. The cohesion rate of each group is the mean score of	119.05999755859375	695.4542236328125	8.040008544921875	405.41070556640625	196

Having established that radical right parties within the EP are not cohesive, it is now	70.94400024414062	224.73590087890625	9.9599609375	410.4815368652344	215
interesting to analyze how they behave vis a vis the other parties. One underlying	70.94400024414062	240.20135498046875	9.9744873046875	410.9283142089844	215
characteristic of radical right parties is indeed their anti-system rhetoric. For this reason, they	70.94400024414062	255.72589111328125	9.9599609375	411.01220703125	215
have alternatively been labeled as populist, extreme right, fascist, or protest-based	70.94400024414062	271.20587158203125	9.9599609375	410.9770202636719	215
organizations (Mudde 2007, 29). Indeed, at the national level, they often reject the system	70.94400024414062	286.68585205078125	9.9599609375	410.7235412597656	215
from its constitutional foundations. At the same time, the system tends to exclude them; at	70.94400024414062	302.1658935546875	9.9599609375	410.90081787109375	215
the national level several institutional barriers such as those coming from the electoral rules	70.94400024414062	317.765869140625	9.9599609375	410.3619384765625	215
have been built in order to marginalize these parties. So, with only some exceptions and	70.94400024414062	333.245849609375	9.96002197265625	410.48150634765625	215
contrary to mainstream parties, radical right parties are usually rooted on the ground of the	70.94400024414062	348.725830078125	9.96002197265625	410.6994323730469	215
society more than they are in public office. As a consequence, they are also largely excluded	70.94400024414062	364.2058410644531	9.96002197265625	410.44171142578125	215
from public resources - consisting mostly of state financing - that are instead largely	70.94400024414062	379.68585205078125	9.96002197265625	411.02081298828125	215
available to cartel parties (Katz & Mair1995). Hence, at the national level radical right parties	70.94400024414062	395.16583251953125	9.96002197265625	410.5184631347656	215
can successfully represent themselves as separate from the system and their distinctiveness	70.94400024414062	410.7658386230469	9.96002197265625	410.4220275878906	215
as a form of non-collusion and disinterestedness. They can do so especially when they	70.94400024414062	426.2658386230469	9.96002197265625	410.6846008300781	215
criticize the state elites, one of the main arguments in their rhetoric. What happens then	70.94400024414062	441.745849609375	9.96002197265625	410.5351257324219	215
when we shift the focus of the analysis to the EU system? Is their anti-system protest also	70.94400024414062	457.225830078125	9.96002197265625	410.7534484863281	215
transferred to the EU level? We found that the Euromanfestos are rich in criticisms to the	70.94400024414062	472.7058410644531	9.96002197265625	411.0325927734375	215
country membership in the EU. (table 3). Now we analyze whether such a broad stance also	70.94400024414062	488.18585205078125	9.96002197265625	410.6564636230469	215
corresponds to an institutional practice of outsiders within the EP.	70.94400024414062	503.78582763671875	9.96002197265625	287.39569091796875	215
In reality, the tendency of IND/DEM, as well as of the radical left, to a participatory and even	70.94400024414062	534.8658447265625	9.96002197265625	410.85784912109375	216
collusive behavior within the EP should not be underestimated (table 9). Although the	70.94400024414062	550.3458862304688	9.96002197265625	410.9271240234375	216
number of times this group was part of a majority in the EP was the lowest among all party	70.94400024414062	565.8258666992188	9.96002197265625	410.6907043457031	216
groups, the total rate (46.2 per cent) is still considerable and certainly higher than we could	70.94400024414062	581.3358154296875	9.960006713867188	410.79437255859375	216
expect from any anti-system force. Hence, in almost half of the cases, IND/DEM was part of	70.94400024414062	596.81591796875	9.959991455078125	410.78753662109375	216
a parliamentary majority. To be sure, their votes only converged with large majorities	70.94400024414062	612.4158935546875	9.959991455078125	410.49163818359375	216
composed of at least two large parties (the European People‘s Party [EPP], the European	70.94400024414062	627.8958740234375	9.959991455078125	410.7516174316406	216
Socialist Party [PSE], or the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe [ALDE]).	70.94400024414062	643.3758544921875	9.959991455078125	410.58123779296875	216
Therefore, their vote was not necessary to build minimum winning coalitions, and	70.94400024414062	658.8558349609375	9.959991455078125	410.60113525390625	216
consequently their blackmail potential and coalition power remained very limited even when	70.94400024414062	674.3358154296875	9.959991455078125	410.7481689453125	216
they joined a majority. Just as at the national level (where only few exceptions can be found	70.94400024414062	689.81591796875	9.959991455078125	410.4119873046875	216
in countries such as Austria and Italy), also in the EP the radical right is largely non-influent	70.94400024414062	705.4158325195312	9.959999084472656	411.0464782714844	216
for the formation of coalitions. For this reason, it is surprising that they voted along the lines	70.94400024414062	720.8958129882812	9.959999084472656	410.4837341308594	216
of a parliamentary majority so many times. Especially when we consider that only a fraction	70.94400024414062	736.371826171875	9.959999084472656	410.42193603515625	216

of the votes of IND/DEM converged with those of parliamentary majorities of centre-right	113.41999816894531	109.2958984375	9.9599609375	411.07627868652344	218

therefore be justified on the bases of some common ideological inclinations. In most cases,	113.41999816894531	140.255859375	9.9599609375	410.44163513183594	218

Certainly, convergence with the EP majority is also due to the consensual nature of the EP	113.41999816894531	440.0658264160156	9.96002197265625	410.8601531982422	234
where decisions are often lowest common denominator agreements among the different	113.41999816894531	455.54583740234375	9.96002197265625	410.54148864746094	234
forces that are represented in this assembly. However, even from this perspective, we could	113.41999816894531	471.0258483886719	9.96002197265625	410.9137420654297	234
not avoid defining the strategy of the radical right in the EP as either one of voice, or one of	113.41999816894531	486.5058288574219	9.96002197265625	410.5092010498047	234
acquiescence. Being that their votes converged with those of large coalitions and were	113.41999816894531	502.1058349609375	9.96002197265625	410.95225524902344	234
therefore not necessary to form a majority, we can hypothesize that the blackmail potential of	113.41999816894531	517.5858764648438	9.96002197265625	410.58116149902344	234
IND/DEM was really limited on those occasions, as well as their capacity to influence the	113.41999816894531	533.0658569335938	9.96002197265625	410.41831970214844	234
final outcome in the decision-making process. Hence, their strategy should really be	113.41999816894531	548.5458374023438	9.96002197265625	410.89903259277344	234
characterized by acquiescence more than by a real capacity to voice their preferences and	113.41999816894531	564.0258178710938	9.96002197265625	410.56126403808594	234
force the other parties to compromise with them. In the end, it seems that radical right parties	113.41999816894531	579.505859375	9.959991455078125	410.59129333496094	234
are rather maximalists on the EU in their rhetoric (although even in this respect the analysis	113.41999816894531	595.1358642578125	9.959991455078125	410.69163513183594	234
of Euromanifestos has shown that in some countries they accept the EU as a level of	113.41999816894531	610.6158447265625	9.959991455078125	410.47166442871094	234
governance) but they tend to exclude the most maximalist option of exit when they operate	113.41999816894531	626.081298828125	9.974517822265625	410.85447692871094	234
within the EU institutions. This result is also confirmed by the attendance rate (82.5%) to the	113.41999816894531	641.5758056640625	9.959991455078125	410.39207458496094	234
plenary sessions of the EP by the MEPs of IND/DEM, a rate that is very close to the average	113.41999816894531	657.055908203125	9.959991455078125	410.77073669433594	234
of the other (mostly mainstream) groups (84.6%). As we have seen, a vote with the majority	113.41999816894531	672.535888671875	9.959991455078125	410.9264373779297	234
corresponds to this high attendance rate in almost half of the cases and a vote against (or	113.41999816894531	688.1358642578125	9.959991455078125	410.5514373779297	234
abstention) in the remaining part. Only when they vote against the majority do they express	113.41999816894531	703.6158447265625	9.959991455078125	410.4416961669922	234
their protest against the main groups, usually by voting with parties on the extremes of both	113.41999816894531	719.0958251953125	9.959999084472656	410.55076599121094	234
left and right (Hagemann 2009). It is evident that radical right parties collect votes in the	113.41999816894531	734.5718383789062	9.959999084472656	410.46165466308594	234

European elections based on a broad Eurosceptical stance (with policy specific positions	70.94400024414062	109.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.5016174316406	236
that are sometimes not as much Eurosceptical). However, once in the EP, it is important to	70.94400024414062	124.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.4912109375	236
note that they express their dissent making use of the rules of the game, voting with the	70.94400024414062	140.255859375	9.9599609375	410.4915771484375	236
opposition more than the other forces do, but voting almost as much with the majority. If	70.94400024414062	155.85589599609375	9.9599609375	411.0885009765625	236
these figures were known by the larger public, it would not be surprising if the protest-based	70.94400024414062	171.33587646484375	9.9599609375	410.9770202636719	236
electorate of these parties felt dissatisfied with their institutional conduct.	70.94400024414062	186.81585693359375	9.9599609375	319.2579345703125	236
It seems that the public office of these parties is way less anti-EU than the political discourse	70.94400024414062	217.8958740234375	9.9599609375	410.9425354003906	237
of their central office. There may be several explanations for this behavior. On the one hand,	70.94400024414062	233.3758544921875	9.9599609375	410.3122863769531	237
there might be a search for legitimacy on the part of these parties. They want to participate in	70.94400024414062	249.005859375	9.9599609375	410.4715881347656	237
the decision-making process and they want to be considered credible coalition partners. This	70.94400024414062	264.48590087890625	9.9599609375	410.80059814453125	237
could be achieved more easily in an assembly such as the EP where coalitions are formed	70.94400024414062	279.96588134765625	9.9599609375	410.50152587890625	237
on an issue-by-issue basis, rather than following pre-arranged coalition agreements between	70.94400024414062	295.44586181640625	9.9599609375	410.83990478515625	237
either the groups or the national delegations. On the other hand, radical right parties might	70.94400024414062	310.92584228515625	9.9599609375	410.5711669921875	237
be aware of the advantages which come with representation in the EP. They can have a	70.94400024414062	326.4058837890625	9.959991455078125	410.5017395019531	237
public office that is often lacking at the national level where they are frequently excluded	70.94400024414062	342.0058288574219	9.96002197265625	410.5512390136719	237
from institutional representation due to electoral rules, the impact of strategic voting in first	70.94400024414062	357.48583984375	9.96002197265625	410.5249938964844	237
order elections, or the marginalization by mainstream parties. The advantages of	70.94400024414062	372.9658508300781	9.96002197265625	410.64105224609375	237
representation in the EP are not negligible, especially for small radical parties. Notably, from	70.94400024414062	388.4458312988281	9.96002197265625	410.9100646972656	237
a financial point of view, parties represented in the EP have access to public financing, which	70.94400024414062	403.92584228515625	9.96002197265625	410.4718322753906	237
has become so relevant for the survival of parties in contemporary times (Katz & Mair 1995,	70.94400024414062	419.42584228515625	9.96002197265625	410.47174072265625	237
Aucante & Dézé 2008). Such funds come directly from the EU budget, in order to allow the	70.94400024414062	435.0258483886719	9.96002197265625	410.82806396484375	237
organizational functioning of the EP. As well, they come from the national budget under the	70.94400024414062	450.5058288574219	9.96002197265625	410.4915466308594	237
form of ordinary contributions or reimbursements of the electoral expenses. Ultimately, either	70.94400024414062	465.98583984375	9.96002197265625	410.3819274902344	237
directly or indirectly, the EP is doing a lot for the financial and organizational survival of small	70.94400024414062	481.4658508300781	9.96002197265625	410.5804443359375	237
radical parties. Alternatively, we could look for other non-strategic explanations of the	70.94400024414062	496.9458312988281	9.96002197265625	410.9263610839844	237
institutional behavior of radical right MEPs. Just like any other actor who is inserted in the	70.94400024414062	512.4258422851562	9.96002197265625	410.4617004394531	237
European decision-making system, they become gradually socialized to the practices and	70.94400024414062	528.0258178710938	9.96002197265625	410.5988464355469	237
principles of the EU governance, through forms of interaction oriented toward consensualism	70.94400024414062	543.5057983398438	9.96002197265625	410.431884765625	237
that in the long term create a sense of trust and identification with the institution and with the	70.94400024414062	558.98583984375	9.96002197265625	410.8923034667969	237
system at large (Schimmelfennig 2000). This could also explain why the radical right often	70.94400024414062	574.4658813476562	9.96002197265625	410.5391845703125	237
takes a more pragmatic stance in the EP than the rhetoric of their central office would	70.94400024414062	589.975830078125	9.959991455078125	410.4717102050781	237
anticipate. None of these potential explanations can be examined in-depth in this paper, but	70.94400024414062	605.455810546875	9.959991455078125	410.9117431640625	237
certainly knowledge on the radical right, as well as on EU politics, would greatly benefit from	70.94400024414062	621.055908203125	9.959991455078125	410.3720703125	237
the analysis of these possible determinants of the party conduct in the EP. In the meanwhile,	70.94400024414062	636.535888671875	9.959991455078125	410.6509094238281	237
although it is not yet possible to talk about a radical right in the EU that is anti-establishment	70.94400024414062	652.0013427734375	9.974517822265625	410.8785705566406	237
but open to government it seems there is already enough evidence to talk about a radical	70.94400024414062	667.4813232421875	9.974517822265625	410.76043701171875	237
right that is anti-establishment and part of the system.	70.94400024414062	682.9613037109375	9.974517822265625	237.27490234375	237

The analysis that was carried out in this paper shows that the radical right is the party block	113.41999816894531	143.85589599609375	9.9599609375	410.53587341308594	241

through party Euromanifestos, and in that of institutional behavior shown by the data on the	113.41999816894531	190.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.47496032714844	241

European issue but to other issues as well, there would be reason to question whether the	113.41999816894531	252.3658447265625	9.9599609375	410.5214080810547	241
radical right could be defined as a party family, or if it should instead be considered a	113.41999816894531	267.84588623046875	9.9599609375	410.83677673339844	241
disordered aggregation of national parties of erratic ideological positions.	113.41999816894531	283.32586669921875	9.9599609375	320.9411163330078	241
The analysis of two different arenas, namely a second-order national electoral arena and the	113.41999816894531	314.4058837890625	9.9599609375	410.80979919433594	242
EP institutional arena, very clearly show that the radical right in Europe is divided into a	113.41999816894531	330.005859375	9.959991455078125	410.75828552246094	242
plethora of stances and policy preferences and by reciprocal enmities and political	113.41999816894531	345.48583984375	9.96002197265625	410.51133728027344	242
antagonism. From the analyses, it emerged that their ideological foundations, programmatic	113.41999816894531	360.9658508300781	9.96002197265625	410.5812225341797	242
supply and organizational features are so diverse that it even seems hard to group them	113.41999816894531	376.4458312988281	9.96002197265625	410.56907653808594	242
under a distinctive party family name. This finding reinforces Mudde‘s (2007) argument about	113.41999816894531	391.92584228515625	9.96002197265625	410.51158142089844	242
the necessity to classify parties that common wisdom tends to pinpoint within the radical right	113.41999816894531	407.4058532714844	9.96002197265625	410.48167419433594	242
with more accuracy. Certainly, this paper shows that in Europe, a famille spirituelle grouping	113.41999816894531	423.0113220214844	9.97454833984375	410.97386169433594	242
the main parties of this political area is, in reality, hardly discernible and even the use of the	113.41999816894531	438.5058288574219	9.96002197265625	410.34226989746094	242
concept of party family could be incorrect when referring to the radical right.	113.41999816894531	453.98583984375	9.96002197265625	333.42079162597656	242
At the same time, a clear tendency toward a greater pragmatism and moderation of the	113.41999816894531	485.0658264160156	9.96002197265625	410.58128356933594	243
MEPs of the radical right emerged in the paper as compared to the party programmatic	113.41999816894531	500.54583740234375	9.96002197265625	410.6610565185547	243
announcements. Although radical right parties represent a source of opposition within the	113.41999816894531	516.0258178710938	9.96002197265625	410.93467712402344	243
EP, some of them also take part in parliamentary majorities in almost the same proportion.	113.41999816894531	531.6258544921875	9.96002197265625	410.4216766357422	243
This phenomenon shows that there is a remarkable distance between the central office and	113.41999816894531	547.1058349609375	9.96002197265625	410.4517059326172	243
the public office of these parties, at least in terms of coherence between the statements of	113.41999816894531	562.5858764648438	9.96002197265625	410.9409637451172	243
the former and the institutional conduct of the latter. Whether this is a conscious, or even a	113.41999816894531	578.06591796875	9.959991455078125	410.4318084716797	243
strategic game played by these parties, is a question that this paper has not addressed.	113.41999816894531	593.5758056640625	9.959991455078125	410.42198181152344	243
Certainly, their conduct raises many questions that future research may address. Overall, the	113.41999816894531	609.055908203125	9.959991455078125	410.80821228027344	243
party public office in the EP is more institutionalized, more inserted in the legislative process	113.41999816894531	624.6558837890625	9.959991455078125	410.43174743652344	243
and even more collusive with the other parties of both sides of the political spectrum than the	113.41999816894531	640.1358642578125	9.959991455078125	410.48179626464844	243
rhetoric and statements of central office makes the public believe. The paper documented	113.41999816894531	655.6158447265625	9.959991455078125	410.6636199951172	243
the ambivalence between a more Eurosceptical party central office and a more collusive EP	113.41999816894531	671.0958251953125	9.959991455078125	410.78050231933594	243
public office. This conflicting valence between central office and public office could be a sign	113.41999816894531	686.5758056640625	9.959991455078125	410.97154235839844	243
of difficulty for these parties in playing the role of legislators and, at the same time, represent	113.41999816894531	702.055908203125	9.959991455078125	410.3024139404297	243
a protest-based electorate. Especially in an assembly like the EP where there is not a clear	113.41999816894531	717.6558227539062	9.959999084472656	410.51341247558594	243
government to oppose and so the temptation to collude with the other parties can be	113.41999816894531	733.1358032226562	9.960006713867188	410.8000946044922	243

amplified. Whether or not this phenomenon limits the capacity of radical right parties in the	70.94400024414062	109.2958984375	9.9599609375	410.431884765625	245
EP to represent their electorate - as they fail to deliver firm opposition against the	70.94400024414062	124.77587890625	9.9599609375	410.7292175292969	245
mainstream parties - is an interesting problem. At the same time, however, the level of	70.94400024414062	140.255859375	9.9599609375	410.74554443359375	245
information of citizens about the activities in the EP is so low that a disappointing behavior of	70.94400024414062	155.85589599609375	9.9599609375	410.3421325683594	245
the MEPs would hardly result in a sanction vote in the following elections. So, it was	70.94400024414062	171.33587646484375	9.9599609375	410.50164794921875	245
interesting to document that in an assembly characterized by limited popular scrutiny as is	70.94400024414062	186.81585693359375	9.9599609375	410.67041015625	245

actually less extreme than many would expect.	70.94400024414062	217.77587890625	9.9599609375	206.57040405273438	245
