lying on the concept of “interbeing” – a Buddhist concept of the interdependence of	127.640625	406.8955993652344	9.839996337890625	340.1028747558594	16

through nonviolence should be practiced in each of these areas. The members of a	127.6602783203125	429.9408874511719	9.839996337890625	340.1562194824219	16

also avoid speech that is harmful. In the sense of interbeing, when we use words of	127.66029357910156	452.9861755371094	9.839996337890625	340.0231475830078	16

Born in Vietnam in 1926, Thích Nhất Hạnh witnessed firsthand the death and	141.87350463867188	627.1985473632812	9.840011596679688	325.8466796875	19
destruction brought on by war. Much of the 20th Century in Vietnam was marked by	127.67439270019531	638.72119140625	9.840011596679688	339.95152282714844	19

In order to understand Thích Nhất Hạnh’s approach to nonviolence, it is essen-	141.85772705078125	210.075927734375	9.8399658203125	325.882080078125	33
tial to first explore his belief in the concept of interbeing. In Buddhist doctrine, this	127.6585693359375	221.59857177734375	9.8399658203125	340.19268798828125	33
principle is traditionally called dependent origination or dependent co-arising. It	127.6585693359375	233.1212158203125	9.8399658203125	340.09014892578125	33
refers to the idea that everything in the universe is interconnected through a complex	127.6585693359375	244.64385986328125	9.8399658203125	340.11761474609375	33
web of cause and effect. Thích Nhất Hạnh describes this principle of intercon-	127.6585693359375	256.16650390625	9.8399658203125	340.0714111328125	33
nectedness through the exploration of the origins of a piece of paper:	127.64874267578125	267.68914794921875	9.8399658203125	275.1599426269531	33
If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this	163.65328979492188	285.204345703125	9.8399658203125	304.152587890625	34
sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees	163.65328979492188	296.72698974609375	9.8399658203125	304.23272705078125	34
cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essen-	163.65328979492188	308.48577880859375	9.8399658203125	304.0766906738281	34
tial for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot	163.65328979492188	320.0084228515625	9.8399658203125	304.1319580078125	34
be here either. We can say that the cloud and the paper inter-are. “Inter-	163.65328979492188	331.5310363769531	9.839996337890625	304.07965087890625	34

fix “inter-” with the verb “to be,” we have a new verb, “inter-be”...Looking	163.65328979492188	354.5763244628906	9.839996337890625	304.06781005859375	34
even more deeply, we can see we are in it too. This is not difficult to see,	163.65328979492188	366.0989685058594	9.839996337890625	304.13385009765625	34
because when we look at a sheet of paper, the sheet of paper is part of our	163.65328979492188	377.6216125488281	9.839996337890625	304.0697937011719	34
perception. Your mind is in here and mine is also, so we can say that every-	163.65328979492188	389.1442565917969	9.839996337890625	304.0766906738281	34
thing is in here in this sheet of paper. (1987, p. 53)	163.65328979492188	400.9030456542969	9.839996337890625	202.21115112304688	34
Another way of saying this is that “we are a part of everything, and everything is	141.85768127441406	418.4182434082031	9.839996337890625	325.8673553466797	35
part of us” (Nhất Hạnh, 1991, p. 103). Looking at things from this perspective, it	127.6585693359375	429.9408874511719	9.839996337890625	340.1039123535156	35
becomes apparent that Nhất Hạnh believes that we are not really completely sepa-	127.67823791503906	441.4635314941406	9.839996337890625	340.09107971191406	35
rate from our enemies. He believes that “we belong to each other; we cannot cut	127.68807983398438	452.9861755371094	9.839996337890625	340.1680603027344	35
reality into pieces. The well-being of ‘this’ is the well-being of ‘that,’ so we have to	127.68807983398438	464.5088195800781	9.839996337890625	340.0301208496094	35
do things together. Every side is ‘our side’; there is no evil side” (Nhất Hạnh, 1991,	127.68807983398438	476.0314636230469	9.839996337890625	340.1177673339844	35
p. 103). Polinska (2007) reports that this concept of interbeing is at the center of	127.69793701171875	487.5541076660156	9.839996337890625	340.08819580078125	35
Nhất Hạnh’s ideas about nonviolence. She observes that Nhất Hạnh’s “Buddhist	127.70777893066406	499.0767517089844	9.839996337890625	340.1028594970703	35
teachings focus on how our interdependence with others makes partisan conflict	127.71759033203125	510.8355407714844	9.839996337890625	340.19940185546875	35
unintelligible. Our interbeing with others implies that whether we are so called ’op-	127.71759033203125	522.358154296875	9.839996337890625	340.08123779296875	35

(Polinska, 2007, p. 93). So one can see how Nhất Hạnh’s concept of “loving your	127.71759033203125	545.4034423828125	9.839996337890625	340.1068420410156	35
enemy” comes from a perspective in which he sees himself as intrinsically con-	127.72740173339844	556.9261474609375	9.839996337890625	340.0812530517578	35

Even the very idea of an “enemy” does not fit into this worldview, in which	127.7274169921875	579.9713745117188	9.840011596679688	339.9537353515625	35
everyone is connected to one another.	127.7274169921875	591.4940185546875	9.840011596679688	150.9908447265625	35

a direct answer to the war. Everyone was ready to die and to kill for their beliefs”	127.66998291015625	290.498779296875	9.8399658203125	340.0536193847656	40

central to engaged Buddhism. Nhất Hạnh’s particular approach to nonviolence is	127.68974304199219	423.9488525390625	9.839996337890625	340.10789489746094	43
encapsulated in The Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings, which advocate approaching	127.68972778320312	435.47149658203125	9.839996337890625	340.05963134765625	43
all people—including opponents—from a perspective of interconnection, openness,	127.68972778320312	446.994140625	9.839996337890625	340.0435485839844	43
and ultimately love.	127.68972778320312	458.51678466796875	9.839996337890625	79.64396667480469	43
1.3. What does “love” mean?	141.88885498046875	476.031982421875	9.87432861328125	118.76873779296875	44
At this point it is important to clarify what Thích Nhất Hạnh and others are refer-	141.88885498046875	493.54718017578125	9.839996337890625	325.88507080078125	45
ring to when they talk about love, because this word can trigger numerous associa-	127.68972778320312	505.0697937011719	9.839996337890625	340.08123779296875	45
tions. Frequently we think of romantic desire or familial affection when we hear the	127.68972778320312	516.82861328125	9.839996337890625	340.10888671875	45
word “love;” for Nhất Hạnh “love” has a different connotation. In his book	127.68972778320312	528.351318359375	9.839996337890625	340.03021240234375	45
Teachings on Love, Nhất Hạnh discusses the Sanskrit word “maitri,” which “can be	127.6897201538086	539.8739013671875	9.874298095703125	340.09400177001953	45
translated as ‘love’ or ‘loving kindness’ :	127.68972778320312	551.3966064453125	9.839996337890625	164.3575439453125	45
Some Buddhist teachers prefer “loving kindness,” as they find the word	163.6844482421875	568.9117431640625	9.839996337890625	304.0865173339844	46
“love” too dangerous. But I prefer the word “love.” Words sometimes get	163.68446350097656	580.4343872070312	9.840011596679688	304.07569885253906	46
sick and we have to heal them. We have been using the word “love” to	163.68446350097656	591.95703125	9.840011596679688	304.1688690185547	46

guage more carefully. “Love” is a beautiful word; we have to restore its	163.68447875976562	615.2384643554688	9.840011596679688	304.1604919433594	46
meaning. The word “maitri” has roots in the word mitra which means	163.68447875976562	626.7611083984375	9.840011596679688	304.23834228515625	46
friend. In Buddhism, the primary meaning of love is friendship. (1997b, p.	163.68447875976562	638.2837524414062	9.840011596679688	304.0914306640625	46

The primacy of love as a feature of nonviolence is also found in the words of	141.87741088867188	163.27691650390625	9.8399658203125	325.89300537109375	50
Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. Terchek (2001) observes that “Gandhi	127.67831420898438	174.799560546875	9.8399658203125	339.9800720214844	50
wants to weave the threads of love everywhere and extend them to everyone, inclu-	127.67831420898438	186.558349609375	9.8399658203125	340.08123779296875	50
ding our enemies” and views “Gandhian love” as founded on an “openness that	127.67831420898438	198.08099365234375	9.8399658203125	340.0448913574219	50
enables a person to find a unity and mutuality with others.” Gandhi equated love	127.67831420898438	209.6036376953125	9.8399658203125	340.20343017578125	50
with nonviolence itself: “Nonviolence, in its active form, is goodwill toward all life.	127.67831420898438	221.12628173828125	9.8399658203125	340.1239929199219	50
It is pure love” (1996, p. 41). For Gandhi then, love is not only an interpersonal	127.67831420898438	232.64892578125	9.8399658203125	340.1256408691406	50
emotion, that is, a feeling that exists between two people. Neither is love something	127.67829895019531	244.17156982421875	9.8399658203125	340.0469207763672	50
soft or sentimental. Key to Gandhi’s concept of nonviolence is his belief in love as	127.6881332397461	255.6942138671875	9.8399658203125	340.2914810180664	50
perhaps one of the most powerful forces for social change: “Power is of two kinds.	127.6881332397461	267.21685791015625	9.8399658203125	340.05167388916016	50
One is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other by acts of love. Power based	127.6881332397461	278.739501953125	9.8399658203125	340.0043411254883	50
on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent then the one derived from	127.68812561035156	290.498291015625	9.8399658203125	339.9731903076172	50
fear of punishment” (Gandhi, 1925, p. 15).	127.68812561035156	302.02093505859375	9.8399658203125	170.96910095214844	50
It was after reading Gandhi that King first came to see “love” as applying to	141.88722229003906	319.5361328125	9.8399658203125	325.86143493652344	51
more than just individuals, but as being a powerful force for change (1956, p. 97).	127.6881103515625	331.0587463378906	9.839996337890625	340.2969970703125	51
When King appealed to his followers to “love your enemy,” he used the Greek term	127.6881103515625	342.5813903808594	9.839996337890625	339.8474426269531	51
agape to describe the “love” that he referred to. “Agape means understanding, re-	127.6881103515625	354.1040344238281	9.87432861328125	340.08123779296875	51
deeming good will for all men,” explained King. He went on to describe it as a “love	127.6881103515625	365.6266784667969	9.839996337890625	340.024169921875	51
seeking to create and preserve community” (King & Washington, 1986, p. 19). For	127.6881103515625	377.1493225097656	9.839996337890625	340.28662109375	51
King, the principle of nonviolence in intrinsically linked to his ideas of “love”:	127.6881103515625	388.9081115722656	9.839996337890625	315.1673583984375	51
At the center of nonviolence stands the principle of love. The nonviolent	163.69268798828125	406.4233093261719	9.839996337890625	304.25115966796875	52
resister would contend that in the struggle for human dignity, the oppressed	163.69268798828125	417.9459533691406	9.839996337890625	304.1739196777344	52
people of the world must not succumb to the temptation of becoming bitter	163.69268798828125	429.4685974121094	9.839996337890625	304.0679016113281	52
or indulging in hate campaigns. To retaliate in kind would do nothing but	163.69268798828125	440.9912414550781	9.839996337890625	304.1133117675781	52
intensify the existence of hate in the universe. Along the way of life, so-	163.6926727294922	452.5138854980469	9.839996337890625	304.07667541503906	52
meone must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of	163.69265747070312	464.0365295410156	9.839996337890625	304.2088928222656	52
hate. This can only be done by projecting the ethic of love to the center of	163.69265747070312	475.5591735839844	9.839996337890625	304.0895080566406	52
our lives. (King & Washington, 1986, p. 19)	163.69265747070312	487.0818176269531	9.839996337890625	177.47625732421875	52
Just as “understanding” is the first word King used to define agape, it is also at	141.88720703125	504.8429870605469	9.874359130859375	325.8948974609375	53
the center of Nhất Hạnh’s idea of love: “Understanding and love are not two things,	127.68807983398438	516.36572265625	9.839996337890625	340.05169677734375	53
but just one” (Nhất Hạnh, 1987, p. 14). For Nhất Hạnh, looking deeply into the	127.69792175292969	527.8883056640625	9.839996337890625	340.06639099121094	53
wants, needs, and suffering of another is essential for achieving both love and peace.	127.69790649414062	539.4110107421875	9.839996337890625	340.07568359375	53
Agreeing with King and Gandhi, Nhất Hạnh believes that “Love is the essence of	127.69790649414062	550.93359375	9.839996337890625	340.0498046875	53
nonviolence” (1993, p. 39). He goes on to say that that “love” is essential to both the	127.69792175292969	562.456298828125	9.839996337890625	340.1109161376953	53
principled and pragmatic goals of nonviolence: “Out of love and the willingness to	127.69793701171875	573.9788818359375	9.839996337890625	339.9927978515625	53

rally” (Nhất Hạnh, 1993, p. 39). Nhất Hạnh’s view is not universally shared. In the	127.69793701171875	597.2603149414062	9.840011596679688	340.0724182128906	53

It is common in the academic literature to define a split between pragmatic and	141.8834228515625	180.7926025390625	9.8399658203125	325.9421691894531	57
principled nonviolence (see Martin & Varney 2003, Schock 2003, and Sharp 1973).	127.6843032836914	192.5513916015625	9.8399658203125	340.1825485229492	57
Those taking the pragmatic approach view nonviolence primarily through the lens of	127.68429565429688	204.07403564453125	9.8399658203125	340.19146728515625	57
action, including peaceful protest, sit-ins, and boycotts, without the necessity for a	127.68429565429688	215.5966796875	9.8399658203125	340.1346740722656	57
corresponding set of beliefs in the fundamental values of nonviolence. According to	127.68429565429688	227.11932373046875	9.8399658203125	340.0408935546875	57
Schock, “nonviolent action is active—it involves activity in the collective pursuit of	127.68429565429688	238.6419677734375	9.87432861328125	340.1434326171875	57

vely, Gene Sharp, a leading proponent of pragmatic nonviolence, argues that:	127.66455078125	371.6295471191406	9.839996337890625	309.5419616699219	58

nonviolence aims to create change by making visible that the institutional power’s	127.67437744140625	499.0772399902344	9.839996337890625	339.9829406738281	60

Nonviolent rhetoric engages the world and seeks to change it by speaking with	141.8636474609375	557.3890380859375	9.839996337890625	325.86578369140625	62

Given the seeming affinity between rhetoric and nonviolence, it is surprising that	141.87347412109375	632.7536010742188	9.840011596679688	325.9100646972656	63

Herrick (2013) explains that “rhetorical discourse typically is a response either to	141.86758422851562	238.6414794921875	9.8399658203125	325.84918212890625	68

compassionate communication and deep listening merges clearly with Herrick’s	127.66845703125	261.686767578125	9.8399658203125	340.0921325683594	68

communication. We seek to show how Nhất Hạnh’s engaged Buddhism can be read	127.66839599609375	429.4685974121094	9.839996337890625	340.0338439941406	69

Nonviolent methods can take many forms, most of which are clearly communi-	141.86749267578125	458.5064392089844	9.839996337890625	325.8742370605469	70
cative. Sharp (1973) categorizes them as protest and persuasion, noncooperation,	127.65853881835938	470.0290832519531	9.839996337890625	340.09796142578125	70
and intervention. Though he explicitly includes persuasion in the first group, actions	127.66835021972656	481.5517272949219	9.839996337890625	340.0067596435547	70
in each of three categories are rhetorical. Certainly protest and persuasion, including	127.66835021972656	493.0743713378906	9.839996337890625	340.0449676513672	70
speeches, music, and picketing are designed to communicate and persuade. In the	127.66835021972656	504.8331604003906	9.839996337890625	340.07740783691406	70
second category, noncooperation, actions such as strikes and boycotts serve not only	127.66835021972656	516.3558349609375	9.839996337890625	340.31129455566406	70
to disrupt normal social and economic activities, but to persuade the public that the	127.66835021972656	527.87841796875	9.839996337890625	340.08238220214844	70
values of the nonviolent movement are worthy of attention and superior to those of	127.66835021972656	539.401123046875	9.839996337890625	340.08522033691406	70

Martin and Varney (2003) note that nonviolent action “creates meanings among	127.66836547851562	597.2504272460938	9.840011596679688	339.8837890625	70

a normative ideal that involves the joining together or two disparate claims	163.67552185058594	267.6798095703125	9.8399658203125	304.0511016845703	75
through recognition and exploration of opposing positions. By uncovering	163.67552185058594	279.20245361328125	9.8399658203125	304.04493713378906	75
the crucial connection between a claim and the attitudes, beliefs, feelings,	163.67552185058594	290.72509765625	9.8399658203125	304.2184600830078	75
values, and needs to which it is connected dispute partners are able to iden-	163.67552185058594	302.48388671875	9.8399658203125	304.0865020751953	75
tify points of agreement and disagreement. These points can then be uti-	163.67550659179688	314.00653076171875	9.8399658203125	304.07867431640625	75
lized to effect coalescence, a joining or merging of divergent positions, by	163.675537109375	325.5291748046875	9.8399658203125	304.1300048828125	75
forming the basis for a mutual investigation of non-conflictual options that	163.675537109375	337.0517883300781	9.839996337890625	304.0983581542969	75
might otherwise have remained unconsidered. (Gilbert, 1995, p. 837)	163.68539428710938	348.5744323730469	9.839996337890625	276.4923095703125	75
Rather than attitude change, argumentation often leads to outcomes that “include	141.87997436523438	366.0896301269531	9.839996337890625	325.853759765625	76
a negotiated agreement, a compromise, or a realization that further dispute is futile”	127.68086242675781	377.6122741699219	9.839996337890625	340.0459442138672	76
(Gilbert, 1995, p. 837). This determination requires listening between dispute part-	127.68086242675781	389.1349182128906	9.839996337890625	340.08323669433594	76
ners and a willingness to speak what they believe deeply. The ability to both listen	127.680908203125	400.8937072753906	9.839996337890625	339.9813232421875	76
and speak in this way is reflected in Nhất Hạnh’s ideas of loving speech and deep	127.68092346191406	412.4163513183594	9.839996337890625	340.07630920410156	76
listening. This approach is challenging given how complex beliefs are.	127.68095397949219	423.9389953613281	9.839996337890625	282.4739532470703	76
The first step of coalescent argumentation is asking the question “why are we ar-	141.88003540039062	441.4541931152344	9.839996337890625	325.88507080078125	77
guing?” (Gilbert, 1995, p. 841). “If I do not know what you want, what you believe,	127.680908203125	452.9768371582031	9.839996337890625	340.1208190917969	77
what you feel, then it is difficult, to say the least, for me to satisfy or shift those	127.68089294433594	464.4994812011719	9.839996337890625	340.06483459472656	77
needs through argumentation” (Gilbert, 1995, p. 842). Persuasion is often thought of	127.68089294433594	476.0221252441406	9.839996337890625	340.1081085205078	77
as taking something (e.g., an arguer takes a point or position away from the other).	127.69073486328125	487.5447692871094	9.839996337890625	340.0142822265625	77
Gilbert argues that “most analytical tools focus on the desire of the respondent to	127.69073486328125	499.0674133300781	9.839996337890625	340.0984191894531	77
eliminate, defeat or otherwise invalidate the proponent's reasons. While this can be	127.69073486328125	510.8262023925781	9.839996337890625	340.07830810546875	77
important in certain circumstances, it should not be the major goal of a respondent,	127.69073486328125	522.348876953125	9.839996337890625	340.2171325683594	77
and certainly not at the outset of a dispute” (Gilbert, 1995, p. 842). Nhất Hạnh and	127.69073486328125	533.8714599609375	9.839996337890625	340.0655212402344	77
coalescent argumentation can be read as viewing argumentation as an opportunity to	127.68087768554688	545.3941650390625	9.839996337890625	340.0467834472656	77
give things to one another. Those gifts may be a change in attitude, the space to	127.68087768554688	556.916748046875	9.839996337890625	339.9820251464844	77
reconsider beliefs, or even just the chance to be heard.	127.68087768554688	568.439453125	9.839996337890625	216.806640625	77
Gilbert writes that a claim is like the tip of an iceberg for a much larger, more	141.8898468017578	585.95458984375	9.840011596679688	325.9207305908203	78
deeply held position: “To effect persuasion one must impact on the entire position	127.69072723388672	597.4772338867188	9.840011596679688	340.0420608520508	78
and not just the claim…[The position] is a matrix of beliefs, attitudes, emotions,	127.69072723388672	609.2360229492188	9.840011596679688	340.0322036743164	78
insights, and values connected to a claim” (1995, pp. 839-840). A critical part of	127.69072723388672	620.7587280273438	9.840011596679688	340.07935333251953	78
Gilbert’s theory is the recognition that arguers do not always have self-awareness of	127.69073486328125	632.2813110351562	9.840011596679688	340.08123779296875	78
the depths of their positions. In the way that a person who is tortured may say	127.69073486328125	643.8040161132812	9.840011596679688	340.1729431152344	78
something they do not believe in order to stop the physical violence, arguers may	127.69073486328125	655.3265991210938	9.840011596679688	340.3062438964844	78
make claims that they do not believe or are fearful to question if there is a threat of	127.69073486328125	666.8493041992188	9.840011596679688	340.0536193847656	78

physical or communicative violence. Nhất Hạnh’s approach calls on practitioners to	127.66845703125	163.27691650390625	9.8399658203125	340.02923583984375	82
engage their own complicated feelings and to listen to those of others.	127.66848754882812	174.799560546875	9.8399658203125	279.83990478515625	82
While most Western rhetorical theorists have thought of rhetoric and persuasion	141.86761474609375	192.56072998046875	9.8399658203125	325.94970703125	83
as synonymous, Foss and Griffin (1995), offer an invitational rhetoric that chal-	127.66851806640625	204.0833740234375	9.8399658203125	340.08319091796875	83
lenges that assumption. It is a rhetoric that is “rooted in equality, immanent value,	127.66851806640625	215.60601806640625	9.8399658203125	340.141357421875	83
and self-determination” (p. 5). Nhất Hạnh might say that the invitation stems from	127.66851806640625	227.128662109375	9.8399658203125	340.0655822753906	83
an understanding of interbeing. Foss and Griffin highlight other features that would	127.66854858398438	238.65130615234375	9.8399658203125	339.97515869140625	83
be familiar to Nhất Hạnh including, non-judgement, appreciation, listening, and	127.66854858398438	250.1739501953125	9.8399658203125	340.1138610839844	83
nonadversarial positioning. Such an approach emphasizes a context in which parti-	127.66854858398438	261.69659423828125	9.8399658203125	340.08319091796875	83
cipants are not opponents and persuasion is not coercion. In relation to nonviolent	127.66854858398438	273.21923828125	9.8399658203125	340.0626525878906	83
rhetoric, Gorsevski (2012) states that “persuasion is not necessarily violent (or even	127.66854858398438	284.74188232421875	9.8399658203125	340.1885070800781	83

ry and challenging. Nhất Hạnh (1995) writes:	127.66854858398438	348.5837707519531	9.839996337890625	183.05258178710938	84
We have to appreciate that truth can be received from outside of—not only	163.66326904296875	366.0989685058594	9.839996337890625	304.0628967285156	85
within—our own group. If we do not believe that, entering into dialogue	163.66326904296875	377.6216125488281	9.839996337890625	304.07855224609375	85
would be a waste of time. If we think we monopolize the truth and we still	163.65341186523438	389.1442565917969	9.839996337890625	304.11248779296875	85
organize a dialogue, it is not authentic. We have to believe that by engaging	163.65341186523438	400.9030456542969	9.839996337890625	304.05108642578125	85
in dialogue with the other person, we have the possibility of making a	163.65341186523438	412.4256896972656	9.839996337890625	304.1615295410156	85
change within ourselves, that we can become deeper. Dialogue is not a	163.65341186523438	423.9483337402344	9.839996337890625	304.06390380859375	85
means for assimilation in the sense that one side expands and incorporates	163.65341186523438	435.4709777832031	9.839996337890625	304.0816345214844	85
the other into its “self.” Dialogue must be practiced on the basis of “non-	163.65341186523438	446.9936218261719	9.839996337890625	304.0855407714844	85
self.” We have to allow what is good, beautiful, and meaningful in the	163.65341186523438	458.5162658691406	9.839996337890625	304.2672424316406	85

If we do not believe that we ourselves are capable of changing our beliefs as a	141.85780334472656	487.5541076660156	9.839996337890625	325.8693084716797	86
result of dialogue and persuasion, then why should we believe that others have this	127.65872192382812	499.0767517089844	9.839996337890625	340.26531982421875	86
ability or desire? If we think that the “other side” is persuadable (not just that they	127.65872192382812	510.8355407714844	9.839996337890625	340.00738525390625	86
should be persuadable) is it only because we think that their belief is a weak one,	127.65872192382812	522.358154296875	9.839996337890625	340.1433410644531	86
that they do not really believe their stated position, or that they are willing to let go	127.65872192382812	533.880859375	9.839996337890625	340.0647277832031	86

persuasion. The ability to persuade, or be persuaded, requires some realization of	127.65872192382812	568.44873046875	9.839996337890625	340.0125732421875	86

lent action, there is the immediate audience, usually institutional powers or their	127.65872192382812	609.2454223632812	9.840011596679688	340.10394287109375	87
representatives. A consequence of nonviolent action may be a violent response, and	127.65873718261719	620.7680053710938	9.840011596679688	340.2416229248047	87
to suffer violence is, itself, a communicative act of nonviolence. In Gandhi’s view	127.65873718261719	632.2907104492188	9.840011596679688	340.08641052246094	87

dhism, the self is often seen as the primary rhetorical audience. In Nhất Hạnh’s	127.6708984375	273.20269775390625	9.8399658203125	340.01434326171875	91

cal studies we are used to talking about multiple audiences for discourse. For Nhất	127.66107177734375	296.484130859375	9.8399658203125	340.09991455078125	91
Hạnh, all beings, in fact all creation, is part of the audience for every speech. This	127.66104125976562	308.00677490234375	9.8399658203125	340.0777587890625	91
includes the speaker as an audience as well. Perelman and Oblrechts-Tyteca (1969)	127.66104125976562	319.5294189453125	9.8399658203125	340.0920715332031	91

means we use to see things more clearly ourselves” (p. 41). When we move past the	127.6610107421875	342.5746765136719	9.839996337890625	340.07537841796875	91
idea of self versus enemy, rhetoric addressed outwardly also has a persuasive effect	127.6610107421875	354.0973205566406	9.839996337890625	340.1385192871094	91
inwardly. To use violent language when speaking to, or about, the perceived enemy	127.6610107421875	365.6199645996094	9.839996337890625	340.0509948730469	91
is to perpetuate violence against oneself. This does not, however, take away from	127.6610107421875	377.1426086425781	9.839996337890625	340.0858459472656	91

of “loving your enemy” can be a difficult concept to embrace. One might think,	127.68077087402344	452.9599914550781	9.839996337890625	340.0576934814453	93

Sharp directly questions the need for a nonviolent ethic that is based in moral ideals	127.68072509765625	476.0052795410156	9.839996337890625	340.1845703125	93
like “loving your enemy.” He states that,	127.68072509765625	487.5279235839844	9.839996337890625	163.2947998046875	93
when understood as a requirement for nonviolent action (rather than a	163.67543029785156	505.0431213378906	9.839996337890625	304.0092010498047	94

rejecting any and all forms of violence—is also the pragmatic one” (2014, p. 11).	127.66842651367188	186.558349609375	9.8399658203125	324.8382263183594	99
The strategic approach to nonviolence is very different from what Nhất Hạnh	141.86752319335938	204.07354736328125	9.8399658203125	325.8722839355469	100

culate. They are not focused on just short term goals of policy or regime change.	127.66845703125	227.11883544921875	9.8399658203125	340.0802307128906	100
Gandhi suggested that without love, you cannot really have nonviolence. He said:	127.66845703125	238.6414794921875	9.8399658203125	326.72882080078125	100

Martin Luther King, Jr. also spoke unequivocally about his commitment to “love our	127.68807983398438	331.5212097167969	9.839996337890625	339.9388122558594	102
enemies.” King explains that “We never get rid of an enemy by meeting hate with	127.68807983398438	343.0438537597656	9.839996337890625	340.0882263183594	102

troys and tears down; by its very nature, love creates and builds up” (2012, p. 50-	127.67825317382812	366.0891418457031	9.839996337890625	340.08026123046875	102

my,” Thích Nhất Hạnh (1995) acknowledges its apparent contradiction: “When	127.67825317382812	429.9310607910156	9.839996337890625	340.0360412597656	103
Gandhi said that love is the force that can liberate, he meant we have to love our	127.67823791503906	441.4537048339844	9.839996337890625	340.05006408691406	103
enemy. Even if our enemy is cruel, even if he is crushing us, sowing terror and in-	127.67823791503906	452.9763488769531	9.839996337890625	340.0812225341797	103
justice, we have to love him. This is the message of Jesus” (p. 84). He says that	127.67822265625	464.4989929199219	9.839996337890625	340.1195983886719	103
gaining knowledge and understanding is the key to this challenge: “Understanding a	127.66842651367188	476.0216369628906	9.839996337890625	339.9827575683594	103
person brings us the power to love and accept him. And the moment we love and	127.66842651367188	487.5442810058594	9.839996337890625	340.0667724609375	103
accept him, he ceases to be our enemy. To ‘love our enemy’ is impossible, because	127.66842651367188	499.0669250488281	9.839996337890625	339.9719543457031	103
the moment we love him, he is no longer our enemy” (Nhất Hạnh, 1995, p. 85). For	127.66842651367188	510.8257141113281	9.839996337890625	340.1038513183594	103
Nhất Hạnh, communication and love are necessary partners in nonviolent practice.	127.67825317382812	522.348388671875	9.839996337890625	340.0616760253906	103
This is a different approach from many rhetorical and nonviolence theorists, but	127.68807983398438	533.8709716796875	9.839996337890625	340.0910949707031	103

Nhất Hạnh also recognizes that it is not obvious to most of us how to cultivate a	141.88339233398438	609.4325561523438	9.840011596679688	325.9474182128906	105

many people know how to do it” (as cited in Malkin, 2003). He often uses the image	127.69412231445312	632.7139892578125	9.840011596679688	340.31182861328125	105
of seeds in ground to illustrate the tendencies that are in each of us. He says that we	127.69412231445312	644.2366333007812	9.840011596679688	340.0765686035156	105

lence. Even as he encourages the cultivation of internal peace, Nhất Hạnh (2003)	127.66015625	227.11932373046875	9.8399658203125	340.09210205078125	109
urges people to actively practice cultivating love and understanding in our interac-	127.67001342773438	238.6419677734375	9.8399658203125	340.08123779296875	109
tions with others: “There are concrete ways to train ourselves to communicate non-	127.67001342773438	250.16461181640625	9.8399658203125	340.08123779296875	109
violently so that compassion for one another is awakened and mutual understanding	127.67001342773438	261.687255859375	9.8399658203125	340.0508728027344	109
becomes possible again. Speaking and listening with compassion are the essential	127.67001342773438	273.20989990234375	9.8399658203125	340.0400390625	109
practices of nonviolent communication” (p. 21). His idea of engaged mindfulness	127.67001342773438	284.7325439453125	9.8399658203125	340.04803466796875	109
involves engaging in practices that build peace both inside oneself and in the world.	127.67002868652344	296.4913330078125	9.8399658203125	335.42201232910156	109
One such practice is writing love letters, both to loved ones and to political lea-	141.87899780273438	314.00653076171875	9.8399658203125	325.8816833496094	110
ders. Nhất Hạnh (1991) refers to letter writing as not just a powerful act of loving	127.67987823486328	325.5291748046875	9.8399658203125	340.1192855834961	110
speech, but also “a practice of looking deeply” (p. 110). Nhất Hạnh was concerned	127.67984008789062	337.0517883300781	9.839996337890625	340.29168701171875	110
by his observation of anger and aggression in the American peace movement noting	127.67984008789062	348.5744323730469	9.839996337890625	340.0106506347656	110
that “People in the peace movement can write very good protest letters, but they are	127.67984008789062	360.0970764160156	9.839996337890625	340.0369567871094	110
not so skilled at writing love letters” (1991, p. 110). Nhất Hạnh hopes that they	127.67985534667969	371.6197204589844	9.839996337890625	340.0478057861328	110
could use practices, like writing love letters, to give them a “fresh way of being	127.67001342773438	383.1423645019531	9.839996337890625	340.0026550292969	110
peace” (1991, p. 110). The letter writing that he encourages is an embodiment of his	127.67001342773438	394.9011535644531	9.839996337890625	340.0694274902344	110
rhetorical nonviolent approach.	127.66020202636719	406.4237976074219	9.839996337890625	125.25332641601562	110

As a Buddhist and peace activist, Nhất Hạnh opposes all armed conflict. During	141.88157653808594	452.9525451660156	9.839996337890625	325.85752868652344	112
the early 2000s, he advocated for the United States to withdraw from the conflict in	127.68246459960938	464.4751892089844	9.839996337890625	340.11273193359375	112
Iraq. In 2006, he wrote a letter to President George W. Bush about his feelings about	127.69230651855469	475.9978332519531	9.839996337890625	340.25318908691406	112
the war.1 There are several features of the letter that should be examined. First, the	127.69230651855469	487.27447509765625	12.962890625	340.0387420654297	112
1 This is the letter Nhất Hạnh wrote to George W. Bush. He sent a handwritten letter to the White House	127.68000030517578	521.35400390625	11.040496826171875	340.1240463256836	113
and released a copy to the public.	127.68791961669922	533.8359375	7.920013427734375	106.8240737915039	113
Dear Mr. President,	127.68792724609375	543.1973876953125	7.920013427734375	63.090728759765625	113
Last night, I saw my brother (who died two weeks ago in the USA) coming back to me in a dream. He	127.68793487548828	552.3211669921875	7.920013427734375	340.15587615966797	113
was with all his children. He told me, “Let’s go home together.” After a millisecond of hesitation, I told	127.68792724609375	561.6826171875	7.920013427734375	340.1517333984375	113
him joyfully, “Ok, let’s go.”	127.68792724609375	570.8065185546875	7.920013427734375	90.34979248046875	113
Waking up from that dream at 5 am this morning, I thought of the situation in the Middle East; and for the	127.68793487548828	580.1679077148438	7.91998291015625	340.10289764404297	113
first time, I was able to cry. I cried for a long time, and I felt much better after about one hour. Then I	127.68792724609375	589.2918090820312	7.9199981689453125	340.01678466796875	113
went to the kitchen and made some tea. While making tea, I realized that what my brother had said is	127.68792724609375	598.6531982421875	7.9199981689453125	340.22296142578125	113
true: our home is large enough for all of us. Let us go home as brothers and sisters.	127.68792724609375	607.7770385742188	7.9199981689453125	264.95782470703125	113
Mr. President, I think that if you could allow yourself to cry like I did this morning, you will also feel	127.68792724609375	617.1384887695312	7.9199981689453125	340.017578125	113
much better. It is our brothers that we kill over there. They are our brothers, God tells us so, and we also	127.68792724609375	626.2623291015625	7.9199981689453125	340.1466064453125	113
know it. They may not see us as brothers because of their anger, their misunderstanding, and their discri-	127.68792724609375	635.623779296875	7.9199981689453125	340.11334228515625	113
mination. But with some awakening, we can see things in a different way, and this will allow us to res-	127.68792724609375	644.7476196289062	7.9199981689453125	340.1093444824219	113
pond differently to the situation. I trust God in you; I trust Buddha nature in you.	127.68792724609375	654.1090698242188	7.9199981689453125	258.2943115234375	113
Thank you for reading.	127.68792724609375	663.2328491210938	7.9199981689453125	73.77082824707031	113

form of the letter is important. Nhất Hạnh wrote it by hand. The format of the com-	127.66845703125	163.27691650390625	9.8399658203125	340.085205078125	117

handwritten mail today. Noam (2005) remarks that the flood of electronic messages	127.66848754882812	186.558349609375	9.8399658203125	339.9819641113281	117
may reduce their persuasiveness and that in that environment “the most effective	127.66848754882812	198.08099365234375	9.8399658203125	340.0684814453125	117

the letter or was persuaded by it because he did not offer any response. But Bush	127.64879608154297	232.64892578125	9.8399658203125	340.0665054321289	117
was not the only audience for the letter. Nhất Hạnh released the letter publically and	127.6488037109375	244.17156982421875	9.8399658203125	340.0271911621094	117
posted it on his website. This allows anyone who can access it the opportunity to be	127.65866088867188	255.6942138671875	9.8399658203125	339.9751892089844	117
persuaded by Nhất Hạnh’s words.	127.65866088867188	267.21685791015625	9.8399658203125	136.95309448242188	117
Nhất Hạnh begins this letter with an intensely personal memory. In this introduc-	141.8577880859375	284.7320556640625	9.8399658203125	325.8919372558594	118
tion, he is clearly trying to approach Bush as another human, not as a leader or poli-	127.66848754882812	296.4908447265625	9.8399658203125	340.08319091796875	118
cy maker. Nhất Hạnh (1991) has written of the importance of attempting to engage	127.66848754882812	308.01348876953125	9.8399658203125	340.08233642578125	118
one’s intended audience. He encourages activists to write letters to leaders “that they	127.66848754882812	319.5361328125	9.8399658203125	340.07659912109375	118
will want to read, and not just throw away” (p. 110). To this end, he writes that “the	127.66847229003906	331.0587463378906	9.839996337890625	340.0757293701172	118
kind of language we use should not turn people off. The President is a person like	127.66847229003906	342.5813903808594	9.839996337890625	340.07127380371094	118
any of us” (Nhất Hạnh, 1991, p. 110). In recounting his dream of his recently decea-	127.66847229003906	354.1040344238281	9.839996337890625	340.0812530517578	118
sed brother, Nhất Hạnh is acknowledging the very human nature of both himself and	127.66848754882812	365.6266784667969	9.839996337890625	340.03118896484375	118
George W. Bush.	127.6684799194336	377.1493225097656	9.839996337890625	69.3877944946289	118
Also in this anecdote, Nhất Hạnh is recounting a moment of joy. This may be an	141.8675994873047	394.9105224609375	9.839996337890625	325.80958557128906	119
unexpected emotion in the context of both Nhất Hạnh’s personal loss and the con-	127.67832946777344	406.43316650390625	9.839996337890625	340.0911102294922	119
flict in the Middle East that he addresses. This reference to his own joyfulness	127.68820190429688	417.955810546875	9.839996337890625	340.0120849609375	119
makes sense in the context of his belief that “To suffer is not enough” (Nhất Hạnh,	127.68820190429688	429.47845458984375	9.839996337890625	340.1117248535156	119
1987, p. 3). In pursuing an end to war, injustice, and even personal suffering, Nhất	127.68820190429688	441.0010986328125	9.839996337890625	340.1097717285156	119
Hạnh emphasizes the importance of stopping in order “to be in touch with the won-	127.68820190429688	452.52374267578125	9.839996337890625	340.0812072753906	119
ders of life” (1987, p. 3). He believes that cultivating the “seeds” of peace and joy	127.68817138671875	464.04638671875	9.839996337890625	340.10394287109375	119
within oneself is important to being able to bring peace and joy to the world.	127.68817138671875	475.56903076171875	9.839996337890625	306.2732238769531	119
When Nhất Hạnh mentions that he “was able to cry,” he is modeling his own	141.88729858398438	493.084228515625	9.839996337890625	325.87152099609375	120
ability to acknowledge and take care of his own feelings. He warns that “when we	127.68817138671875	504.8429870605469	9.839996337890625	340.1187744140625	120
hold back our feelings and ignore our pain, we are committing violence against	127.68817138671875	516.36572265625	9.839996337890625	340.0184020996094	120
ourselves,” (Nhất Hạnh, 2003, p. 16). The importance of being aware of, and nurtu-	127.68817138671875	527.8883056640625	9.839996337890625	340.08123779296875	120
ring, our own suffering is frequently reiterated by Nhất Hạnh as an essential step	127.68817138671875	539.4110107421875	9.839996337890625	340.04296875	120
towards peace. He writes, “The practice of nonviolence is to be here, to be present,	127.68817138671875	550.93359375	9.839996337890625	340.15814208984375	120
and to recognize our own pain or despair” (Nhất Hạnh, 2003, p. 16). He suggests	127.68817138671875	562.456298828125	9.839996337890625	340.0782165527344	120
that to “recognize, embrace, and transform” difficult feelings can help us from har-	127.68817138671875	573.9788818359375	9.839996337890625	340.0841979980469	120
ming ourselves or others (2003, p. 17). Gilbert’s idea of a claim being the tip of an	127.68817138671875	585.5015258789062	9.840011596679688	340.0174865722656	120
iceberg resonates here. Nhất Hạnh is sharing with Bush his matrix of beliefs and	127.68815612792969	597.2603149414062	9.840011596679688	340.05860900878906	120
values that support his opposition to war. That sharing may lead to more effective	127.68814086914062	608.782958984375	9.840011596679688	340.0617370605469	120

When Nhất Hạnh (2003) states that “our home is large enough for all of us,” and	141.87989807128906	163.27740478515625	9.8399658203125	325.8437042236328	124
extends an invitation to “go home as brothers and sisters,” (p. 62) he is referring to	127.6807861328125	174.800048828125	9.8399658203125	340.0460205078125	124
the concept of interbeing discussed earlier. Nhất Hạnh believes that once individuals	127.6807861328125	186.558837890625	9.8399658203125	340.0821533203125	124
realize their “interconnectedness with others,” they will begin to see how their ac-	127.68077087402344	198.08148193359375	9.8399658203125	340.0812225341797	124
tions affect themselves and “all other life” (2003, p. 62). In the letter’s following	127.68075561523438	209.6041259765625	9.8399658203125	340.1216125488281	124
paragraph, Nhất Hạnh, continues in this vein by saying that “It is our brothers and	127.68075561523438	221.12677001953125	9.8399658203125	340.0546875	124
sisters that we kill over there” (2003, p. 62). While he draws attention to death and	127.68074035644531	232.6494140625	9.8399658203125	340.0773162841797	124
destruction caused by the war, Nhất Hạnh avoids blaming Bush alone, by using the	127.68072509765625	244.17205810546875	9.8399658203125	340.0616149902344	124
words “we kill.” By communicating in this way, Nhất Hạnh illustrates that, in ac-	127.68069458007812	255.6947021484375	9.8399658203125	340.0714111328125	124
cord with his belief in interbeing, that he also considers himself part of the cause of	127.67086791992188	267.21734619140625	9.8399658203125	340.1128234863281	124
this suffering.	127.67086791992188	278.739990234375	9.8399658203125	55.529083251953125	124

peals to Bush as a Christian when he writes that “God tell us so.” In the forward to	127.68069458007812	308.0238037109375	9.8399658203125	340.0538635253906	125
Living Buddha, Living Christ, David Steindl-Rast (1995), a Catholic Benedictine	127.68069458007812	319.54644775390625	9.87432861328125	340.0753479003906	125
monk, writes that “From the biblical perspective there is no human being who is not	127.68069458007812	331.0690612792969	9.839996337890625	340.22808837890625	125
alive with God’s own breath” (p. xiv). In his writing and talking about the intersec-	127.68069458007812	342.5917053222656	9.839996337890625	340.08123779296875	125
tion of Buddhist and Christian beliefs, Nhất Hạnh offers this relationship of God to	127.68069458007812	354.1143493652344	9.839996337890625	340.07623291015625	125
all beings as a way for Christians generally, and Bush specifically, to understand	127.68067932128906	365.6369934082031	9.839996337890625	340.0654754638672	125
interbeing. He also, however, acknowledges the challenge of seeing people as “bro-	127.6806640625	377.1596374511719	9.839996337890625	340.091064453125	125

sunderstanding, and their discrimination,” Nhất Hạnh is addressing the issue of	127.68069458007812	400.4410705566406	9.839996337890625	340.0585632324219	125
understanding. He is modeling for Bush the practice of looking deeply, trying to	127.68069458007812	411.9637145996094	9.839996337890625	340.0498352050781	125
understand the suffering that leads to violence.	127.68069458007812	423.4863586425781	9.839996337890625	186.81939697265625	125
Nhất Hạnh concludes his letter on a hopeful note. He clearly believes that trans-	141.8798370361328	441.0015563964844	9.839996337890625	325.87620544433594	126
formation is possible, and that seeing “things in a different way” can lead to respon-	127.67086791992188	452.5242004394531	9.839996337890625	340.08123779296875	126
ding “differently to the situation.” While Nhất Hạnh is deeply opposed to Bush’s	127.67086791992188	464.0468444824219	9.839996337890625	340.0595397949219	126
actions in Iraq and the Middle East, this practice gave him an opportunity to practi-	127.68067932128906	475.5694885253906	9.839996337890625	340.08409118652344	126
cing his own deep looking and loving speech. In this letter, Nhất Hạnh is both lo-	127.6806640625	487.0921325683594	9.839996337890625	340.0812683105469	126
ving his “enemy” and modeling for Bush how one can “love your enemy.”	127.68069458007812	498.8509216308594	9.839996337890625	298.4354248046875	126
Conclusion	127.68069458007812	533.766845703125	9.84002685546875	47.695465087890625	127
Nonviolence, when viewed simply as a strategy to stop or avoid an immediate	141.8896484375	551.4063720703125	9.839996337890625	325.8682861328125	128
conflict, can be successful for a time. Thích Nhất Hạnh shows us that nonviolent	127.6806640625	562.9290771484375	9.839996337890625	340.0576171875	128
rhetoric and nonviolent living as a continuing practice are necessary if we are to	127.68069458007812	574.45166015625	9.839996337890625	340.2022705078125	128
create a world of peace. To this end, we have outlined what a rhetorical theory of	127.68069458007812	585.9743041992188	9.840011596679688	340.09405517578125	128
nonviolence looks like from the writings of Nhất Hạnh. His approach asks the non-	127.68069458007812	597.4969482421875	9.840011596679688	340.0812683105469	128
violent speaker to be concerned with audience, argument, and style. In the sense of	127.68072509765625	609.2557373046875	9.840011596679688	340.0135803222656	128
interbeing, audiences are composed of the speaker, all who encounter their discourse	127.68072509765625	620.7783813476562	9.840011596679688	340.08514404296875	128
and in a fundamental way, the whole universe; to harm one is to harm all. When	127.69052124023438	632.301025390625	9.840011596679688	340.0694885253906	128
making arguments, we should examine why we hold the positions we do and articu-	127.70036315917969	643.8236694335938	9.840011596679688	340.0812530517578	128
late them truthfully, but be open to change. Non-attachment to views is central to	127.70037841796875	655.3463134765625	9.840011596679688	340.033203125	128
both engaged Buddhism and persuasion. In terms of style, we must be mindful that	127.70039367675781	666.8689575195312	9.840011596679688	340.08811950683594	128

M. PHILLIPS-ANDERSON, R. PHILLIPS-ANDERSON	147.67889404296875	134.9573974609375	9.8399658203125	231.79452514648438	130
Writing…	424.40350341796875	134.9573974609375	9.8399658203125	40.944244384765625	131
language can be violent. Speakers should not just avoid making threats, but ap-	127.66845703125	163.27691650390625	9.8399658203125	340.08123779296875	132
proach themselves and their perceived enemy with love. Nhất Hạnh does not offer	127.66845703125	174.799560546875	9.8399658203125	340.0960388183594	132
this as a prescriptive rhetorical theory. Rather these are ideas designed to guide	127.66848754882812	186.558349609375	9.8399658203125	340.0321350097656	132
people to speak and listen in way that increases love, decreases violence, and creates	127.66848754882812	198.08099365234375	9.8399658203125	340.01666259765625	132
the possibility for true peace.	127.66848754882812	209.6036376953125	9.8399658203125	116.34815979003906	132
If those of us who study rhetoric and communication believe that we can change	141.86761474609375	227.11883544921875	9.8399658203125	326.0367126464844	133
the world through language and that those efforts are preferable to violence, we	127.66849517822266	238.6414794921875	9.8399658203125	340.03499603271484	133
should devote more of our scholarly attention to nonviolence. Using violent rhetoric	127.66848754882812	250.16412353515625	9.8399658203125	340.22247314453125	133
and hating our perceived enemies while advocating for peace is still participating in	127.66848754882812	261.686767578125	9.8399658203125	340.0548095703125	133
the culture of war. In many places, nonviolence is the only form of protest accepted	127.66848754882812	273.20941162109375	9.8399658203125	340.21405029296875	133
by most citizens and political institutions. Its effectiveness can be enhanced through	127.66848754882812	284.7320556640625	9.8399658203125	339.9869689941406	133
engagement with Nhất Hạnh’s approach of nonviolent communication. The success	127.66848754882812	296.4908447265625	9.8399658203125	340.0841979980469	133
or failure of nonviolence is not measured in one conflict, one movement, or one	127.66848754882812	308.01348876953125	9.8399658203125	340.0685119628906	133
time. We return to the ideas of the leaders of principled nonviolence because they	127.66848754882812	319.5361328125	9.8399658203125	340.1325988769531	133
have applicability in all contexts, not simply in response to one instance of violence	127.66848754882812	331.0587463378906	9.839996337890625	340.0262451171875	133
or oppression. It is an ongoing practice that has the potential to save the world.	127.66848754882812	342.5813903808594	9.839996337890625	314.8408203125	133
