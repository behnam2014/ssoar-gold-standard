Abstract: Nowadays we have a wide variety of computer-assisted qualitative data analysis	144.6999969482422	180.79248046875	9.247314453125	362.51612854003906	5
software, CAQDAS, to choose from, and almost every qualitative researcher uses one or two of	144.6999969482422	194.99249267578125	9.0	381.6271514892578	5
these programs to analyse his/her data. This demand for CAQDAS has brought not only more	144.6999969482422	209.092529296875	9.01324462890625	375.26112365722656	5
sophistication in the newest programs and updates but also the discussion about its methodological	144.6999969482422	223.29248046875	9.0	398.80506896972656	5
implications and the need for more training courses and workshops. A lot has been written about	144.6999969482422	237.39251708984375	9.0	386.3430938720703	5
the relation between CAQDAS and qualitative methodology. Nevertheless, the ways the training	144.6999969482422	251.592529296875	9.0	382.90602111816406	5
courses and workshops have been developed and carried out have not been outlined. Who are	144.6999969482422	265.6925048828125	9.0	381.11610412597656	5
these courses planned for? Is there any prerequisite that the attendants must fulfil? What must the	144.6999969482422	279.89251708984375	9.0	394.1931915283203	5
main goal of these training courses be? This article discusses some facts I have found in my	144.6999969482422	293.99249267578125	9.0	370.3141632080078	5
experience as a social researcher and CAQDAS user and trainer in a country where this kind of	144.6999969482422	308.1925048828125	9.0	381.81617736816406	5
software is not widespread. The article also focuses on some of the problems that arise when train-	144.6999969482422	322.29248046875	8.999969482421875	396.69703674316406	5
ing people in the use of CAQDAS and the consequences the globalisation of training courses and	144.6999969482422	336.4924621582031	9.013275146484375	390.4390411376953	5
workshops focused on the acquisition of mechanical code-and-retrieve skills have for qualitative	144.6999969482422	350.59246826171875	9.0	383.40199279785156	5
methodology. Finally, I propose some critical issues that CAQDAS trainers and qualitative	144.6999969482422	364.79248046875	9.0	358.96412658691406	5
researchers should bear in mind when teaching or learning the use of any qualitative data analysis	144.6999969482422	378.8924865722656	9.0	393.8491973876953	5

Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software, CAQDAS, are very	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	364.12159729003906	27
common among qualitative researchers nowadays. The first programmes were	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	384.4169464111328	27
created in the 60s, but it was in the 80s and early 90s when they began to be	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	375.7158966064453	27
widely recognised in the field of qualitative analysis. Today the use of software to	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	394.77894592285156	27
assist qualitative analysts is a must, and there is a wide range of programmes to	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	392.1498565673828	27
choose from, each one including specific tools for the handling and storage of	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	378.9279327392578	27
different qualitative data. Some of them can work only with text, others can	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	364.5617218017578	27
handle images, sound and video; some build hierarchical trees of categories,	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	375.0008087158203	27
others let the researcher build their own "trees", and others simply list the	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	357.3567352294922	27
categories alphabetically. Most of them can create reports according to the	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	364.95777893066406	27
analyst's needs; some can be used as a first step in the analysis of data, and the	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	394.3059844970703	27
results can be exported to other programmes for further analysis. Although the	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	383.2729034423828	27
tools the programmes offer have revolutionised the way of doing qualitative	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	366.6518096923828	27
analysis, there are still qualitative researchers who systematise their data	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	356.9277801513672	27
manually in a reliable way. [1]	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	144.2469940185547	27
Together with the increase of the use of these programmes, many workshops to	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	391.26991271972656	28
train researchers in the use of them have been developed. Some workshops are	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	392.3731231689453	28
led by universities and research centres, and others are provided by private	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	367.8618927001953	28
enterprises. Some are offered to small groups of researchers, others are offered	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	392.3479766845703	28
to anyone who wants to learn to use these programmes. But most of them are	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	381.17189025878906	28
one-day or two-day training workshops, which guarantee participants that they	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	381.65589904785156	28
will acquire the adequate skills to use a specific software in their own qualitative	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	388.45375061035156	28
projects. [2]	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	57.24699401855469	28
The most well known programmes are the code-based theory-builders (MILES &	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.01617431640625	392.7379913330078	29
WIETZMAN, 1995), and most of the workshops offer training in the use of one of	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	394.41603088378906	29
these programmes. I have trained some qualitative researchers interested in	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	372.94386291503906	29
knowing CAQDAS, and some quantitative researchers who simply wanted to	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	374.0438995361328	29
know the way a text analysis software works, but kept on using SPSS. Although	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	389.08082580566406	29
software to assist qualitative data analysis is almost unknown in Colombia (or	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	377.18983459472656	29
perhaps because of it), my brief experience as CAQDAS user and trainer has	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	377.73976135253906	29
made me wonder: Are we on the right track offering one-day or two-day training	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	388.3549346923828	29
workshops? And, even more important, are we on the right track when separating	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	397.95802307128906	29

The use of CAQDAS is rapidly growing among qualitative researchers. This has	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	389.32289123535156	35
implied the creation of many workshops round the world to train people in the use	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	397.17689514160156	35
of the software. Some programme developers travel widely to lead one-day or	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	379.8079376220703	35
two-day workshops, which are now highly appreciated in many countries, such as	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	397.04493713378906	35
the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. These workshops are open	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	397.99098205566406	35
to anyone who wants to be trained in the use of a programme; being a qualitative	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	395.60389709472656	35
researcher is no prerequisite. [4]	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	158.54701232910156	35
The demand for workshops is focused on two programmes: Atlas.ti and NUD.IST.	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	398.9698028564453	36
I think that this is due to two main reasons: (1) these are the most well known	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	377.25575256347656	36
programmes world-wide; and (2) most of the novice qualitative researchers who	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	389.0149688720703	36
want to use a CAQDAS ask more experienced researchers for the "best"	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	354.92588806152344	36
programme, and most of the time they are referred to Atlas.ti and NUD.IST. [5]	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	384.14698791503906	36
This phenomenon has been strongly criticised. Not because of the programmes	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	388.84999084472656	37
themselves, but because they are based on the Grounded Theory Methodology.	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	390.6431427001953	37
COFFEY, HOLBROOK and ATKINSON (1996) say that the wide spread use of	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	385.38490295410156	37
software developed around Grounded Theory, would lead us to the	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	326.96397399902344	37
homogenisation of all the qualitative analysis processes; i.e. we all would become	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	397.77088928222656	37
grounded theorists. [6]	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	110.0469970703125	37
LONKILA (1995) suggests that the fact is that some aspects of Grounded Theory	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	396.57203674316406	38
have been overemphasised, especially the process of coding. In other words,	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	377.1898956298828	38
some of the qualitative researchers are using Grounded Theory because the	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	373.6699981689453	38
software they use is based on this methodology. The advantages and	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	339.5700225830078	38
disadvantages that this may bring have been long discussed (see also LEE &	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	377.26795959472656	38
FIELDING, 1996). My own experience has shown me that that is causing	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	355.4539031982422	38
prejudicial effects in the qualitative research field, something that I had already	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	383.65785217285156	38
mentioned in a previous article (CARVAJAL, 2001). But there is another fact to	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	383.86671447753906	38
bear in mind: some qualitative researchers use CAQDAS because these	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	353.44081115722656	38
programmes are fashionable. [7]	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	159.2469940185547	38
I have found that some researchers prefer Atlas.ti or NUD.IST based on aspects	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	392.24879455566406	39
like the user-friendliness and the interface, instead of the fact that the	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	338.76683044433594	39
programmes are useful to their methodology. Once a qualitative researcher asked	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	390.56483459472656	39
me about the "best" programme of all (this is the first question CAQDAS users	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	372.8518829345703	39
ask); I told her that there was no "best" programme, but that based on the data	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	381.2949981689453	39
and methodology of her research, I could suggest her one. After some interchange	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	388.5011749267578	39
of emails, she decided to buy NUD.IST Vivo because it was the latest version	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	377.25575256347656	39

available in the market, and because its interface was more attractive. It is not	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	380.28480529785156	42
that a programme must not have an attractive interface; but the decision to use	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	385.67091369628906	42
one or the other must be made from the basis of the methodology the researcher	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	395.6370391845703	42
is going to use. Buying a CAQDAS is like buying a tie: you will look for a tie that	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	387.5076446533203	42
matches the suit you are going to wear. [8]	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	208.3470001220703	42
2.2 What people believe and expect from CAQDAS	144.6999969482422	193.38201904296875	11.0	263.0868682861328	43
As I said before, in Colombia the software to assist qualitative analysis is almost	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	390.27980041503906	44
unknown; because of this, most of the people I have trained had no previous	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	373.59291076660156	44
knowledge about CAQDAS. When I asked what they expected from this software,	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	398.92591857910156	44
the answer was very simple: "to use the programme to analyse our data". This is	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0162353515625	392.8330841064453	44
the first misunderstanding about CAQDAS that trainers must fight. No	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	340.2296905517578	44
programme can analyse data. They can help the analyst to organise the	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	351.1279754638672	44
documents, categorise them and facilitate the processes of searching documents	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	396.5609893798828	44
and categories. But the process of interpreting and building results from the	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	368.56581115722656	44
categories and the relations among them is up to us. We must do the analysis	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0162353515625	380.42701721191406	44
(DEY, 1993). [9]	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	79.24699401855469	44
The possibility of reducing the time of analysis by using a programme is also one	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	394.34986877441406	45
of the expectations that novice CAQDAS users have. If we compare the process	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	391.65480041503906	45
of computer-assisted analysis to the traditional cut and paste, the amount of time	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	394.78993225097656	45
will be significantly reduced. But the time of analysis depends not only on the fact	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	395.8239288330078	45
of using a CAQDAS or not, but also on the amount of data that is going to be	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	375.6059112548828	45
analysed, the type of analysis the researcher is going to do and the expertise of	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	388.1459503173828	45
the researcher in the use of the software. Novice users, especially those who	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	375.5728302001953	45
have no background in qualitative research and methods, must realise that	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	364.79286193847656	45
qualitative analyses imply longer time than quantitative analyses do. Using a	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	372.27284240722656	45
CAQDAS is not like inputting data in a spreadsheet and pressing OK to obtain	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	380.78700256347656	45
results. It implies a long process of reading, segmenting and categorising the	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	376.0569610595703	45
data. And, finally, if the researcher wants, he/she can also search among his/her	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	392.64503479003906	45
documents and categories, formulate hypothesis and test them just before	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	362.7719268798828	45
building his/her conclusions. [10]	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	159.3470001220703	45
A last expectation novice users have is related to the results of the research.	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	373.1968536376953	46
Novice users are interested in the way the programme can help them to write the	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	394.74586486816406	46
final report of their research. That is, how the outputs can be integrated into the	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	387.0899200439453	46
final report. The outputs (results of searches, reports on categories, diagrams,	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	381.5788116455078	46
etc.) have different formats, depending on the software used. Most of the	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	356.4658660888672	46
programmes generate outputs that can be exported as ASCII or ANSI files (text-	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	391.72084045410156	46
only documents), and then can be edited using a word processor. No qualitative	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	389.68592834472656	46
programme generates outputs that can be directly included as a part of the report	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	397.32008361816406	46
of a research. Once again, it is the researcher who has to write his/her	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	343.4967803955078	46
conclusions in the final report. [11]	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	167.64698791503906	46
These expectations, understandable in the context of researchers that have no	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	384.50502014160156	47

There were 44 planned CAQDAS workshops, divided as follows: fourteen on	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	373.5597686767578	53

as on Decision Explorer and winMAX, and one on The Ethnograph. 29 out of 44	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	389.81800842285156	53

ones. There was only a one-day workshop for advanced users. All of the 44	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	368.9839630126953	53
workshops were hands-on, and in seven of them, participants were invited to	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	374.24183654785156	53
bring their own data. Only three workshops specified the maximum number of	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	378.8948516845703	53
participants (5, 10 and 20 respectively). [14]	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	214.14698791503906	53
In addition to the CAQDAS workshops, there were a few other courses on	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	360.45872497558594	54
CAQDAS related topics, such as a two-day course on Computer Assisted	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	358.1488494873047	54
Qualitative Data Analysis, with practical demonstrations of up to five packages	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	381.6448516845703	54
and hands-on workshops on at least three packages. There was also a two-day	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	388.1790313720703	54
course on Handling Qualitative Data followed by a three-day workshop on a	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	368.5768585205078	54
programme, and a five-day retreat on the Focus Group method, which included	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	386.2649688720703	54
the use of software. [15]	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	118.24699401855469	54
Apparently the workshops were open to anyone who was interested in the use of	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	393.53602600097656	55
a programme to assist qualitative analysis. Only 3 out of 44 workshops and	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	366.63987731933594	55
courses required the fulfilment of some prerequisites. It was prerequisite to have	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	392.39698791503906	55

workshops allowed me conclude: (1) most of the workshops are one-day	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	354.32090759277344	56
sessions; (2) it is not prerequisite to be a qualitative researcher, nor to have	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	368.74183654785156	56
previous knowledge of qualitative research and methods to attend a workshop;	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	384.3069610595703	56
(3) although all the workshops are hands-on, only few of them allow participants	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	389.61708068847656	56

train participants in the use of the basic tools of a programme, but a few of them	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	390.92884826660156	59

These workshops could lead to a misleading use of the programmes as tools to	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	387.9589385986328	60
assist qualitative analysis and, in consequence, the undertaking of qualitative	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	376.38697814941406	60

imposed by the software. This is not a joke. It can really happen; and what is	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	373.55982971191406	60

Now I would like to talk about my own experience with a specific workshop, which	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	396.9458770751953	62
illustrates the problems that can arise when novice users face CAQDAS. One of	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	390.37879943847656	62
the first workshops I ran was in the use of NUD.IST 4, and it was directed to a	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	380.0497589111328	62
group of about eight young researchers. They were interested in using a	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	352.96788024902344	62
CAQDAS to analyse an enormous amount of field notes they had already made.	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0162353515625	391.5861358642578	62
They wanted a one-day workshop to acquire the basic tools to use NUD.IST 4. [19]	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	397.7470245361328	62
After telling them that the programme could not do the analysis for them, I began	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	394.59193420410156	63
by the origins of NUD.IST and told them that although its design was based on	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	383.48194885253906	63
Grounded Theory, it could be used with any methodology. At this point, they	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	370.77687072753906	63
interrupted me and asked me about Grounded Theory, which they did not know.	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	390.42298889160156	63
In that moment I stopped and brought up the basics of Grounded Theory, and	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	379.7090606689453	63
then continued the workshop as planned. At the end, I told them to email or	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	367.5537872314453	63
telephone me in the future if they needed further help in the use of NUD.IST. I	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	380.3357696533203	63
should not have done so. [20]	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	144.7469940185547	63
Some days after the workshop they called me because they were not sure about	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	392.73304748535156	64
how to code. Besides, they wanted more information about the coding process	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	383.0749053955078	64
used in Grounded Theory, because they considered that it was the methodology	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	391.49000549316406	64
they were going to use, instead of the one they proposed when they designed	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	379.32398986816406	64
their research project. Some time later they called me again to tell me what they	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	390.1367950439453	64
had done up to that time and then asked me: "what is the next step?" I met them	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	392.97499084472656	64
and noticed that they had based all their analysis on the process of coding. I tried	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	396.20899963378906	64
to make them realise that maybe that was not the way analysis should be done,	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	388.3219757080078	64
but they were just focused on the deadline of their research. What kind of final	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	381.9198760986328	64
report did they write? I do not know. What validity does that research have? I do	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	390.29090881347656	64
not know either. [21]	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	99.5469970703125	64
This experience exemplifies what COFFEY, HOLBROOK and ATKINSON warned	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	398.82679748535156	65
us in 1996: the homogenisation of all the ways of doing qualitative analysis due to	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	398.4088897705078	65
the use of CAQDAS. Those young researchers believed that because NUD.IST	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	387.26600646972656	65
was designed based on Grounded Theory, that methodology was the one they	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	382.9980010986328	65
had to use, because it suited the programme. It also exemplifies one of the	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	365.3757781982422	65
consequences one-day workshops bring: these novice CAQDAS users believed	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	389.25685119628906	65
that the use of a programme was going to strengthen and validate the	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	340.87889099121094	65

Bernardo TURNBULL (2001), referring to his own experience, once said:	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	355.2668914794922	70
"running [a CAQDAS] without training was much like sneaking into an artisan's	167.39999389648438	250.43609619140625	10.0	344.7998962402344	71
workshop and learning about the art and trade by looking at her tools. [...] I have said	167.39999389648438	264.53607177734375	10.0	372.6596984863281	71
more than once that teaching the use of a software to someone who could not do the	167.39999389648438	278.736083984375	10.0	373.5597839355469	71

His experience showed me that I was not alone in this crusade: CAQDAS	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0162353515625	357.8358917236328	72
workshops should not be limited to learning the use of the software's tools. So I	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	386.91383361816406	72
wondered, what else must a CAQDAS workshop include? More than the use of	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	385.60487365722656	72
the software (anyone who has the user's guide can learn how to use it), the	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	366.98182678222656	72
workshops must include basic elements to develop critical thinking in the	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	354.02378845214844	72

analysis. [25]	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	64.24699401855469	73

WEITZMAN and MILES (1995) designed a worksheet with four key questions to	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	390.2799835205078	75
guide researchers to choose the right software. The questions are (p.9): (1) What	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	397.2979278564453	75
kind of computer user am I? (2) Am I choosing for one project or the next few	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	377.09083557128906	75
years? (3) What kind of project(s) and database(s) will I be working on? (4) What	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	395.4938507080078	75
kind of analysis am I planning to do? I consider these four questions to be	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	360.49192810058594	75
currently valid, though they were formulated in 1995. Here I want to paraphrase	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	387.27687072753906	75
the first question. [26]	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	105.94700622558594	75
Most of current CAQDAS workshops (it does not matter which programme), are	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	388.3108673095703	76
focused on the use of the programme; i.e., the main goal is that participants	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.01617431640625	369.9068145751953	76
acquire the basic skills in the use of a software. As seen above, all the workshops	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	398.66188049316406	76
announced on mailing lists refer to one-day or two-day workshops. Basically,	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	373.9887237548828	76
what most trainers do in workshops is to show participants how to import	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	353.95777893066406	76

and/or test hypothesis and how to make reports. I myself began by doing so in	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	382.3819122314453	80
the first workshops I ran. Paraphrasing WEITZMAN and MILES (1996), what kind	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	397.04481506347656	80
of CAQDAS users are we training? I wondered. [27]	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	252.8470001220703	80
To use a CAQDAS is more than knowing how to import documents, code them	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	384.5049591064453	81
and make reports. It is not only to fit the software to the methodology the	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	354.5738067626953	81
researcher is using or vice versa, as shown in the related case. It is also to know	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	393.0959014892578	81
how our methodology relates to the tools the software has. I have known	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	354.17784118652344	81
researchers who believe that the more tools they use the more complete their	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	378.10292053222656	81
analysis is. And other researchers who believe that because the programme does	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	398.84901428222656	81
not have the tools they need, it means that their research has exceeded the	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	369.09388732910156	81
programme's capacities. Both of these are misconceptions of what the tools and	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	391.2699737548828	81
the programmes are for. [28]	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	140.54701232910156	81
The students that registered for my seminar were particularly interested in the	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	379.1587677001953	82
use of CAQDAS to analyse the data of their undergraduate thesis. But after our	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0162353515625	387.60804748535156	82
first session they were disenchanted: I told them that only in the sixth session we	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	393.8769073486328	82
were going to use software. The first five sessions were focused on the	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	347.44578552246094	82
introduction to the seminar, the history of CAQDAS, their main characteristics, the	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	399.44264221191406	82
process of coding in qualitative research, and the relation between theory-	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	361.52586364746094	82
building software and Grounded Theory. This last topic was included to prevent	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	386.49586486816406	82
students believing that Grounded Theory is the right methodology to be used	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0162353515625	374.59706115722656	82
when working with CAQDAS. [29]	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	164.04701232910156	82
After these seminar sessions, we went into the workshop sessions. I trained my	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	388.1568145751953	83
students in the use of EZ-Text, winMAX 99, NUD.IST 4, and Atlas.ti 4.2. I had	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	379.1696319580078	83
planned to work with HyperRESEARCH too, but we did not have enough time. By	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	397.15480041503906	83
the end of the semester we returned to the seminar sessions to discuss the use	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	388.5858917236328	83
of the programmes and the relation between software and qualitative methods.	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	384.5159454345703	83
Each of my students was using a particular methodology in his/her thesis, so we	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	390.97291564941406	83
could share our points of view about the way each one was going to use the	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	370.6999053955078	83
chosen software. [30]	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	105.0469970703125	83
In the last session they told me that they had finally understood why the first five	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	390.58778381347656	84
sessions were more theoretical than they expected. It is worth saying that all the	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0162353515625	390.93104553222656	84
students who attended my seminar had previously taken a seminar on Qualitative	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	397.3859405517578	84
Research, but had no previous knowledge on CAQDAS. [31]	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	295.54701232910156	84
I have stated that CAQDAS workshops are open to everyone who wants to use a	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	395.09791564941406	85
programme of this kind; it is not a prerequisite to be a qualitative researcher or to	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	395.1638946533203	85
have a background on qualitative methodology. Must CAQDAS be limited to be	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	385.86878967285156	85
used only by qualitative researchers? I do not think that is the solution. I believe	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	387.9918975830078	85
that CAQDAS workshops must include training in qualitative methods if the	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.01617431640625	365.3008575439453	85
participants do not have previous knowledge of it. But if participants do, it is worth	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	397.8808135986328	85
highlighting that the software is nothing but a tool. A tool that researchers can use	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	399.20082092285156	85
in several ways, according to their methodology and needs. Researchers must	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	382.7890167236328	85

How many of CAQDAS trainers are CAQDAS critics? Most of them defend the	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	382.5247344970703	90

the disadvantages these programmes bring? To know a software is to know	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	370.0728302001953	90
about the methodological implications its use has for qualitative methodology.	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	377.91578674316406	90
There are lots of papers, articles and even books about this topic. But how much	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	393.2829132080078	90
of this literature is included as basic bibliography in the workshops? I know that	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	385.3959503173828	90
some workshops led by universities world-wide promote the discussion about the	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	394.65785217285156	90
relationship between CAQDAS use and qualitative methodology. But most of	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	374.10975646972656	90
workshops do not. I think that there is an economical factor for this: one-day or	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	383.94386291503906	90
two-day workshops are income producing. To include more information in the	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	376.9368438720703	90
workshops would imply more than two or three sessions, and it would increase	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	383.0418243408203	90

It is not up to the participants who attend a CAQDAS workshop to discover the	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	382.5797882080078	91

brings to qualitative methodology has been limited to academics. It has become	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	388.67396545410156	92
an almost theoretical topic not included in CAQDAS workshops. But I believe that	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	396.2088165283203	92
every CAQDAS user has something to say about this, if he/she is given the	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	366.55287170410156	92

using programmes is a researchable field. The academic discussion has to be	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	380.9409942626953	92

participants will be. The lack of information and the neophilia are the two	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.01617431640625	352.93995666503906	93
elements that would lead us to weak qualitative analyses, giving weight to those	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	389.4878692626953	93
who believe that to introduce computers in qualitative research is counter-	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	360.00782775878906	93

productive. It is also possible that some of the trained researchers begin to be	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	379.87391662597656	98
critical before CAQDAS when using a programme on their own research. That	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	380.76490783691406	98
was my case. Nonetheless, I think that by introducing aspects like some	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	351.2407989501953	98

participants will not fall in neophilia and will be careful when using a programme	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0162353515625	387.9870147705078	98
to analyse their data. [36]	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	123.94700622558594	98

As we could see in Section 2.3, only 7 out of the 44 mentioned CAQDAS	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	354.59580993652344	100
workshops invited participants to bring their own data. I know it is impossible to	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	384.8346710205078	100
work individually with every participant on his/her own data. It is better to offer	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	378.39979553222656	100
personal advice to researchers. Besides, for academic purposes, it is easier to	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	382.65687561035156	100
give the participants in a workshop the same documents to do exercises with a	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	384.2628936767578	100
programme: we will always know what segments of the document (be it text,	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	371.86585998535156	100
images, sound or video) the participants are working with. But is it not a	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	348.9416961669922	100
workshop's goal that participants know how to analyse their own data? Of course;	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	398.01295471191406	100
but they will only work on their data when returning to their research projects. And	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	398.36488342285156	100
the work of trainers ends when the workshops end; and by experience I have	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	375.57301330566406	100

My experience with the seminar in the Universidad de los Andes showed me that	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	393.71192932128906	101
only when participants begin to analyse their own data, can really understand the	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	394.8009796142578	101
way the software works and how to use it according to their methodology. I used	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	391.7759552001953	101
my own material to train my students, although they began to analyse their own	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	387.17799377441406	101
thesis material by the mid-semester. From that moment the questions they had	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	385.3408966064453	101
about the use of the software increased a hundred percent. By the end of the	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	376.41993713378906	101
semester they suggested to me to allow them to use their own data from the	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	372.0857696533203	101
beginning: "it was easier for me to use the programme when analysing my	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	362.24085998535156	101
interviews, because I knew what my research question was, and what I was	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	368.8407745361328	101
looking for in the answers of my interviewees", one of them said, and the others	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	388.6629180908203	101
agreed. [38]	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	59.0469970703125	101
I believe that once the participants have been trained in the basic tools of a	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	366.00282287597656	102
programme, it is time to allow them to experience the programme by themselves.	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	395.4608917236328	102
By doing so, they will find the best way to segment and code their data, and how	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	392.3369903564453	102
codes and categories can be organised. Trainers must not only guide participants	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	398.0679473876953	102
in the appropriate use of the software according to the methodology participants	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	390.27992248535156	102
are using, but they also have to confront them with the decisions they have to	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	377.6848907470703	102
make in the process of analysis. [39]	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	178.8470001220703	102
Of course, this is only possible if the workshops are not limited to one or two	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	371.64576721191406	103
days. This process of accompanying novice CAQDAS users implies a long time	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	387.7168731689453	103
course. I think that this process is only possible in academic environments	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	361.4158172607422	103
(undergraduate and postgraduate research students), or with full-time and part-	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	387.33192443847656	103
time researchers really interested in the use of a programme to assist their	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	363.9788055419922	103
analysis. But people interested only in the mechanical operation of the software	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	11.0162353515625	386.9730987548828	103

can be trained in one session. I myself was trained in a three-hour session on	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	378.26783752441406	106

only when analysing my own data did I found that there was something missing in	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	398.1779327392578	106
the programme and its relation to qualitative methodology. [40]	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	305.94700622558594	106

CAQDAS workshops are planned to train in the use of only one programme. Only	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	397.35292053222656	108
one of the above mentioned workshops was intended to show participants more	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	389.5869903564453	108
than one programme (the course on Computer Assisted Qualitative Data	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	354.4528045654297	108
Analysis), but it was not precisely a training workshop. I believe that when training	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	398.4529571533203	108
people who do not have previous knowledge of any software to assist qualitative	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	391.87489318847656	108
analysis, we must show them that there is not only one programme. We must tell	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	394.7788848876953	108
them about the wide variety of software available and the different functions they	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	393.18385314941406	108
have. I know that training in the full use of a programme would imply a very long	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	389.94984436035156	108
process; but by giving participants the basic tools of various programmes, and by	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	395.74696350097656	108
allowing them to experience the software with their own data, they would select	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	385.4068145751953	108
the appropriate programme according to the tools it has and the type of analysis	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	390.87391662597656	108
the participants are going to do. I have already related the case of the researcher	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	395.8460235595703	108
who wanted to buy the "best" programme. She trained herself with the demo	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	372.58692932128906	108
version of NUD.IST Vivo, and decided that that was the best programme, but did	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	393.27198791503906	108
not try other software. [41]	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	128.54701232910156	108
As shown in Section 2.3 most of CAQDAS workshops are on Atlas.ti, NUD.IST	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	383.53663635253906	109
versions Vivo, 4 and 5, and a smaller number on winMAX and The Ethnograph.	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	386.92494201660156	109
But there are many other programmes: AQUAD, CoAn, Code-A-Text, Diction,	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	378.25672912597656	109
DIMAP, HyperRESEARCH, KEDS, TEXTPACK, TexSmart, and BEST, among	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	382.41468811035156	109
others. It is not that someone interested in the use of a CAQDAS must be trained	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0162353515625	395.94020080566406	109
in all of this software, but if trainers show participants the wide variety of existing	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	391.0497589111328	109
programmes and their main characteristics and functions, participants will have	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	385.5167999267578	109
real elements to choose the software that better fits their needs. [42]	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0162353515625	333.3470001220703	109
In my seminar I trained my students in the use of the basic tools of four	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	347.00584411621094	110
programmes, with the possibility of using the complete version of three of them.	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	387.88185119628906	110
This, combined with discussions about the methodology they were going to use	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	387.17799377441406	110
on their thesis, gave us the opportunity to choose the most adequate software for	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	396.56105041503906	110
their particular needs. In the end, all of the participants chose the same software	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	392.18299865722656	110
although their methodologies were very different. To decide what software to use,	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	398.0128936767578	110
they took into account two factors: the user-friendliness and the flexibility. They	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	385.25282287597656	110
told me that they did not want a programme that was very rigid in the organisation	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	398.47486877441406	110
of the categories and material; they preferred a programme that would allow them	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	398.9148712158203	110

Computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software has become a basic tool for	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	395.8239288330078	114
qualitative researchers; a tool to aid them in their process of analysis. Cutting with	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	399.1568145751953	114
scissors and pasting with glue, our traditional way of systematising our data, is	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	382.53578186035156	114
now seen as archaic work. However, we cannot forget that that way of	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	342.3857879638672	114
systematising was widely used by every qualitative researcher round the world	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	381.9419708251953	114
until a decade ago; even today some researchers still use index cards and	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	362.5598907470703	114
cabinets to organise their data. And it works. [44]	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	239.04701232910156	114
What are the advantages of using software to assist qualitative analysis, then?	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	383.7898712158203	115
These programmes facilitate the processes of segmenting, categorising,	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	353.2648468017578	115
annotating, retrieving, and searching within and across documents and	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	345.66392517089844	115
categories. All of this can be done in a fast way, and the original documents are	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	388.3880157470703	115
not fragmented. Researchers can find what they want just by doing the right	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	370.00685119628906	115
selection, and the PCs can store lots of documents that otherwise required big	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	382.1729278564453	115
cabinets and folders. The programmes by themselves are neither good nor bad	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	387.16700744628906	115
for qualitative research. It is the way that qualitative researchers use them that	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	382.20582580566406	115
influences qualitative methodology. Even so, in some cases, programmes have	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	386.7489776611328	115
replaced the method. And it is a real fact that some programmes, especially	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	369.53370666503906	115
those based on Grounded Theory, include new tools that were not used before in	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	396.0110626220703	115
qualitative methods. These new tools imply new ways of doing qualitative analysis	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	399.3549346923828	115
(KELLE, 1996), but are not intended to be a method by themselves. [45]	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	351.8470001220703	115
Every qualitative researcher who uses CAQDAS is responsible if the programme	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	393.0298614501953	116
replaces the method. Over all, this is a responsibility of every researcher who	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	375.9357452392578	116
trains in the use of CAQDAS. We cannot believe that these programmes are the	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	391.96290588378906	116
panacea in qualitative analysis just because they are widely used today. In	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	363.3848419189453	116
Colombia the use of this software is still limited to small groups of researchers. I	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	389.75160217285156	116
believe this is the reason why it was easy for me to notice that the workshops	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	376.63978576660156	116
focused on the use of the software would raise methodological implications for	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	382.01881408691406	116
qualitative research. [46]	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	120.24699401855469	116
Based on my experience, I have presented four critical issues that I believe	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	366.3547821044922	117
qualitative researchers must bear in mind when training or being trained in the	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	380.7538604736328	117
use of CAQDAS: giving more information, promoting critical thinking, the	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	353.71571350097656	117
possibility of analysing participant's own data, and knowing the wide variety of	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	379.0048370361328	117
programmes. These issues would prevent a misuse of CAQDAS and would	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	367.4328155517578	117
strengthen qualitative research methods. The programmes are the tools and we	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	389.6638946533203	117
are the artisans. It is up to us how we use them. [47]	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	255.64698791503906	117
