ABSTRACT. Time studies in psychology or in consumer behaviour,	76.35430145263672	218.20565795898438	9.0	245.98892974853516	14
traditionally think of the personal future as a Lewinian ‘life space’,	76.35430145263672	228.20556640625	9.0	245.99787139892578	14
containing several well-known time dimensions: future time per-	76.35430145263672	238.20547485351562	9.0	246.00061798095703	14
spective, future anxiety, and hope. Those dimensions are used to test	76.35430145263672	248.20538330078125	9.0	245.9898452758789	14
the predictive power of various behaviours (attitudinal change,	76.35430145263672	258.2052917480469	9.0	245.99524688720703	14
health behaviour, delay of gratification, etc.) or more specifically:	76.35430145263672	268.2052001953125	9.0	246.00421905517578	14
the temporality of consumer behaviours as implied in consumption	76.35430145263672	278.2051086425781	9.0	245.99616241455078	14

purchasing. However, the personal future is flexible enough to	76.35430145263672	298.2049255371094	9.0	245.9889907836914	14
enable individuals to project themselves well beyond this ‘life space’	76.35430145263672	308.204833984375	9.0	245.99616241455078	14
into a post-mortem future. In this context, I propose to look at the	76.35430145263672	318.2047424316406	9.0	245.99622344970703	14
concept of death anxiety. Researchers studying the influence of time	76.35430145263672	328.20465087890625	9.0	245.99796295166016	14
representations on human behaviour should not limit themselves to	76.35430145263672	338.2045593261719	9.0	245.99527740478516	14
apprehending the traditional dimension of personal future; they	76.35430145263672	348.2044677734375	9.0	245.99518585205078	14
could integrate an understanding of the future that projects us beyond	76.35430145263672	358.204345703125	9.0	245.98892974853516	14
physical death. This requires first a close examination of the rela-	76.35430145263672	368.2042236328125	9.0	245.99970245361328	14

dimensions, and then broadening the scope to various human and	76.35430145263672	388.20404052734375	9.0	245.98172760009766	14

‘Temporal consciousness cannot be divorced from the awareness of death.’	48.0	74.443115234375	9.999969482421875	317.9959411621094	19
With this phrase, Clay Routledge and Jamie Arndt (2005) draw our attention to	48.0	85.94308471679688	10.0	317.986083984375	19
the potential contiguity of two fundamental human faculties, thinking about time	48.0	97.44308471679688	10.0	317.9910888671875	19
and death anticipation. The aim of this article is to integrate death anticipation in	48.0	108.94308471679688	10.0	318.0020751953125	19
the conceptual structure of our time experience. Close relations between death	48.0	120.44308471679688	10.0	317.9930419921875	19
and time have already been demonstrated. For example, Held and Nützinger	48.0	131.94308471679688	10.0	317.9891052246094	19
(1998) and Sabelis (2002) discuss the dominance of ‘clock time’ as the ultimate	48.0	143.44308471679688	10.0	317.99005126953125	19
mode for conjuration of finitude. However, if we want to expand our scope	48.0	154.94308471679688	10.0	317.98602294921875	19
beyond relations with ‘clock time’, we should envisage death with other forms	48.0	166.44308471679688	10.0	317.987060546875	19
of time experience, also qualified by perception, perspective or temporal	48.0	177.94308471679688	10.0	318.0019836425781	19
orientation.1 Very early, the French philosopher Guyau (1890) considered time	48.0	189.36175537109375	10.081329345703125	317.9935607910156	19
as a product of the consciousness and wrote that the past and the future are	48.00049591064453	200.94308471679688	10.0	317.9950180053711	19
represented. In keeping with the tradition of Lewin (1942), psychologists and	48.00049591064453	212.44308471679688	10.0	317.98412322998047	19
social psychologists such as Fraisse (1967), Nuttin (1980), Raynor and Entin	48.00049591064453	223.94308471679688	10.0	317.98509979248047	19
(1982), have contributed considerably to the structuring and the knowledge in	48.00049591064453	235.44308471679688	10.0	317.98412322998047	19
this field of research. Moreover, among the three temporal zones, the future has	48.00049591064453	246.94308471679688	10.0	317.99498748779297	19
been the object of specific research (Bouffard, 1993; Zaleski, 1996, 2005), as	48.00049591064453	258.4430847167969	10.0	317.98909759521484	19
much as on the means of apprehending and living it cognitively and emotionally	48.00049591064453	269.9430847167969	10.0	317.98717498779297	19
as on its behavioural impact (Strathman and Joireman, 2005). But what future	48.00049591064453	281.4430847167969	10.0	317.9961166381836	19
are we discussing? Since the works of Lewin (1942), most works traditionally	48.00049591064453	292.9430847167969	10.0	317.99007415771484	19
think of the personal future as a Lewinian ‘life space’ (Bergadaà, 1990;	48.00049591064453	304.4430847167969	10.0	317.9909896850586	19
Strathman and Joireman 2005). In psychology for example, this ‘life space’ con-	48.00049591064453	315.9430847167969	10.0	317.99498748779297	19
tains several well-known dimensions that are used to test the predictive power of	48.00049591064453	327.4430847167969	10.0	317.99193572998047	19
various behaviours (attitude change, health behaviour, delay of gratification,	48.00049591064453	338.9430847167969	10.0	317.9890670776367	19
etc.). In marketing and consumer behaviour, other behaviours are tested	48.00049591064453	350.4430847167969	10.0	317.9950180053711	19
(consumption of cultural goods, exploratory consumer behaviour, mail order	48.00049591064453	361.9430847167969	10.0	317.98702239990234	19
purchasing, etc.). Yet, Boyd and Zimbardo (1997) strayed onto another path by	48.00049591064453	373.4430847167969	10.0	317.98006439208984	19

and Groves (2007) outline the importance of the encounters with death to ‘tame	48.00049591064453	396.4430847167969	10.0	317.99706268310547	19
the future’. Finally, Routledge and Arndt (2005: 59) add that, ‘Being able to	48.00049591064453	407.9430847167969	10.0	317.9820785522461	19

In keeping with the works of these authors, this article proposes to integrate	48.00049591064453	430.9430847167969	10.0	317.9930953979492	19
death anticipation, and more specifically death anxiety, into the structure of	48.00049591064453	442.4430847167969	10.0	317.99303436279297	19
one’s personal future. On the individual level, this new integration requests first	48.00049591064453	453.9430847167969	10.0	317.99205780029297	19

researchers studying the influence of time representations on human behaviour,	40.35430145263672	62.443115234375	10.0	317.99308013916016	22

This research firstly presents the classical Lewinian notion of personal future,	50.35430145263672	108.44308471679688	10.0	308.0010757446289	22
highlights some of its aspects, shows how death anxiety is part of the personal	40.35430145263672	119.94308471679688	10.0	317.98905181884766	22
future, and presents some of the major behavioural impacts. Second, by using	40.35430145263672	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.99210357666016	22

consciousness of time’ (Piettre, 1994: 117, author’s translation). Paul Fraisse, an	40.354305267333984	259.4430847167969	10.0	317.99805068969727	24
eminent psychologist of time, wrote that philosophical reflection had preceded	40.354305267333984	270.9430847167969	10.0	317.995059967041	24
scientific reflection on a number of issues, and that this process was certainly	40.354305267333984	282.4430847167969	10.0	317.99509048461914	24
still underway. After presenting the work of several philosophers on the links	40.354305267333984	293.9430847167969	10.0	317.99106216430664	24
between death awareness and the representation of time, I will argue how death	40.354305267333984	305.4430847167969	10.0	317.9890785217285	24
anxiety can be integrated into the network of the personal future.	40.354305267333984	316.9430847167969	10.0	259.04504776000977	24

The subjective experience of time and, more specifically, the representation	40.354305267333984	362.9430847167969	10.0	317.99805068969727	26
humankind has constructed of time, has been one of philosophy’s favourite	40.354305267333984	374.4430847167969	10.0	317.9880714416504	26
topics. Nonetheless, the variety of ways in which philosophy grasps time should	40.354305267333984	385.9430847167969	10.0	317.98215103149414	26
prompt us to caution. It led Pélicier (cited in Sutter, 1983) to write that all	40.354305267333984	397.4430847167969	10.0	318.00204849243164	26
philosophers have dealt with time without giving any definite answers, since	40.354305267333984	408.9430847167969	10.0	317.98508071899414	26
none of them talk about the same thing. He continues by stating that they are	40.354305267333984	420.4430847167969	10.0	317.99206924438477	26
only philosophers in one particular moment and grasp time on the basis of their	40.354305267333984	431.9430847167969	10.0	317.9900550842285	26
own personal issues that depend on their own life stories and status. While	40.354305267333984	443.4430847167969	10.0	317.98608779907227	26
time is thought of as a ‘dilation of the soul’ by St Augustine or as an ‘intimate	40.354305267333984	454.9430847167969	10.0	317.98617935180664	26
consciousness’ by Husserl, it is a space of possibilities and action projects for	40.354305267333984	466.4430847167969	10.000007629394531	317.99609756469727	26
Heidegger (1927/1986). According to Heidegger, ‘authentic’ time is the open-	40.354305267333984	477.9430847167969	10.0	317.9910011291504	26
ended time of projects; it is the characteristic of human reality to be projected	40.354305267333984	489.4430847167969	10.0	318.0050392150879	26
before one’s own situation. Our relation to time is determined by the tragic fate	40.354305267333984	500.9430847167969	10.0	318.00012588500977	26
of our personal future and the awareness that our future’s limitation, that is, of	40.354305267333984	512.443115234375	10.0	318.00207901000977	26
the more or less 700,000 hours theoretically at our disposal. ‘Authentic time’ is	40.354305267333984	523.943115234375	9.999996185302734	317.9861183166504	26

ness of his/her own death: human existence is finite and it is precisely the	48.0	62.443115234375	10.0	317.9880676269531	29
‘anticipation of one’s own finiteness’, the co-presence of death – source of	48.0	73.943115234375	9.999969482421875	317.99591064453125	29

bilities and plans. French philosopher Marcel Conche (1980: 71) wrote: ‘Death	48.0	96.94308471679688	10.0	317.9940185546875	29
is my fate. So be it. I anticipate it. I refuse to wait until time passes and let the	48.0	108.44308471679688	10.0	317.99017333984375	29
future come to me. I anticipate the future; I decide what it will be; I determine it’	48.0	119.94308471679688	10.0	318.0099792480469	29
(author’s translation). Confronted with the ‘destined power’ of time, several	48.0	131.44308471679688	10.0	318.00201416015625	29
reactions are possible. Conche suggests that there are several types of illusions	48.0	142.94308471679688	10.0	317.9949951171875	29
that make it possible to forget about one’s mortality: the ‘religious illusion’	48.0	154.44308471679688	10.0	318.0001220703125	29
opens up the hope of life after death; the ‘moral illusion’ awards hope of	48.0	165.94308471679688	10.0	317.9930419921875	29
eternity on the basis of merit; the ‘social illusion’ works, thanks to prestige,	48.0	177.44308471679688	10.0	317.99713134765625	29
fame, consideration and glory; the ‘ontological illusion’ relies on possessions	48.0	188.94308471679688	10.0	317.9911804199219	29
and the ‘apparent consistency of reality’ (author’s translation); finally, with the	48.0	200.44308471679688	10.0	317.99810791015625	29
‘practical illusion’, oblivion is granted, thanks to action: by focusing on my task,	48.0	211.94308471679688	10.0	317.9891357421875	29
action makes me forget my own mortality. Thus, from a metaphysical point of	48.0	223.44308471679688	10.0	317.9901428222656	29
view, death awareness is not only a cornerstone of our awareness of time, but it	48.0	234.94308471679688	10.0	317.9950256347656	29
also generates behaviours aiming at supporting or abolishing finiteness.	48.0	246.44308471679688	10.0	286.28912353515625	29
Personal future: From life space to death anxiety	48.0	274.8804016113281	10.0	208.53201293945312	30
Ever since Lewin, the personal future is considered as a possible extension of	48.0	292.4430847167969	10.0	317.99505615234375	31
one’s life space. Lewin writes that life space is extended during what he calls	48.0	303.9430847167969	10.0	317.998046875	31
‘the psychological time dimension’. The psychological time dimension of one’s	48.0	315.4430847167969	10.0	317.99407958984375	31
life space increases from hours, days and months up to years. In other words,	48.0	326.9430847167969	10.0	317.9830322265625	31
young children live in the immediate present. As they age, an evermore distant	48.0	338.4430847167969	10.0	317.9930419921875	31
psychological past and future affects their present behaviours. Psychologists of	48.0	349.9430847167969	10.0	317.99713134765625	31
time, such as Fraisse (1967), Nuttin (1980), Bouffard (1993), Zaleski (1997,	48.0	361.4430847167969	10.0	317.98504638671875	31
2005) have followed this approach and have shown how several different	48.0	372.9430847167969	10.0	317.9909973144531	31
dimensions of one’s personal future may affect one’s behaviour. Nuttin even	48.0	384.4430847167969	10.0	317.9960021972656	31
went so far as to create a theory of human motivation based on the notion of	48.0	395.9430847167969	10.0	317.9900817871094	31
personal future. He considers that the future is a pivotal life space, as opposed to	48.0	407.4430847167969	10.0	317.989013671875	31
the present and the past, which are of lesser importance. Several dimensions	48.0	418.9430847167969	10.0	317.9940490722656	31
structure our future. Among these dimensions, the best-known are the future	48.0	430.4430847167969	10.0	317.9961242675781	31
time perspective (FTP), the consideration of future consequence, anxiety, hope	48.0	441.9430847167969	10.0	317.99609375	31
and future-orientation. The future time perspective represents all the goals of an	48.0	453.4430847167969	10.0	318.0019836425781	31
individual, that is, ‘all future mental representations associated with an affect’	48.0	464.9430847167969	10.000007629394531	318.00897216796875	31
(Bouffard, 1993, author’s translation). There are two components in the FTP: a	48.0	476.4430847167969	10.0	317.99603271484375	31
cognitive component and an affective component. The cognitive component of	48.0	487.9430847167969	10.0	317.98309326171875	31
the FTP is made up of ‘goal objects’ (Nuttin, 1980), which are more or less	48.0	499.4430847167969	10.0	317.9920349121094	31
distant from the present. According to Lens (1993), someone whose goals are	48.0	510.943115234375	10.0	317.9890441894531	31
mainly located in the immediate future has a limited FTP, whereas someone	48.0	522.443115234375	9.999996185302734	318.00006103515625	31

whose goals extend to a distant future has an extended FTP. Moreover,	40.35430145263672	50.943115234375	10.0	317.9870071411133	34
Strathman et al. (1994) developed a new dimension, the consideration of future	40.35430145263672	62.443115234375	10.0	317.9900894165039	34
consequences (CFC), which deals with ‘the extent to which individuals think	40.35430145263672	73.943115234375	9.999969482421875	317.9861526489258	34
about the relatively immediate versus distant consequences of their potential	40.35430145263672	85.44308471679688	10.0	317.9990921020508	34
actions’. As for the affective dimension of the FTP, it corresponds to one’s	40.35430145263672	96.94308471679688	10.0	317.9971389770508	34
affective attitude towards the future, which in turn consists of both a positive and	40.35430145263672	108.44308471679688	10.0	317.9861831665039	34
a negative side. The manifestations of the positive side are optimism and hope.	40.35430145263672	119.94308471679688	10.0	317.9860305786133	34
Thus, according to Zaleski (1993), the future, when considered as an environ-	40.35430145263672	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.9820022583008	34
ment conducive to making plans and reaching one’s goals, usually takes on a	40.35430145263672	142.94308471679688	10.0	317.9800491333008	34
positive motivational dimension in that it prompts one to constructive action and	40.35430145263672	154.44308471679688	10.0	317.9871292114258	34

of the specialists in the field of hope. The negative affective attitude has been	40.35430145263672	177.44308471679688	10.0	317.99698638916016	34
considered from the angle of anxiety with regard to the future. Zaleski (1997)	40.35430145263672	188.94308471679688	10.0	317.9930191040039	34
defines it as a state of anxiety, uncertainty, fear, or concern caused by unfavour-	40.35430145263672	200.44308471679688	10.0	317.9989700317383	34
able changes that could occur in one’s distant personal future. Predominant	40.35430145263672	211.94308471679688	10.0	317.99610137939453	34
temporal orientation is yet another important factor. According to the definition	40.35430145263672	223.44308471679688	10.0	318.0000991821289	34
given by Nuttin (1980), this temporal orientation is the preferential or predomi-	40.35430145263672	234.94308471679688	10.0	318.0010452270508	34
nant orientation of an individual towards one of the three temporal directions:	40.35430145263672	246.44308471679688	10.0	317.9939956665039	34
past, present or future. Thus, if an individual’s centre of interests, concerns or	40.35430145263672	257.9430847167969	10.0	317.99304962158203	34
conversations pertain to the future, he is then said to be future-oriented.	40.35430145263672	269.4430847167969	10.0	285.70606231689453	34
If temporal orientation, in its broader sense, is one of the most fundamental	50.35430145263672	280.9430847167969	10.0	307.99011993408203	34
aspects of humanity, most of the publications devoted to it consider the future as	40.35430145263672	292.4430847167969	10.0	317.9881362915039	34
a Lewinian life space and do not take into account events that may occur after	40.35430145263672	303.9430847167969	10.0	317.9949722290039	34
this life space. Yet for Boyd and Zimbardo (1997) the future can be partitioned	40.35430145263672	315.4430847167969	10.0	317.9870376586914	34
into pre- and post-death time frames. While the traditional psychological and	40.35430145263672	326.9430847167969	10.0	317.9941177368164	34
‘mundane’ future begins in the present and extends to physical death, this	40.35430145263672	338.4430847167969	10.0	317.98816680908203	34
new notion of a transcendental future starts with physical death and goes on to	40.35430145263672	349.9430847167969	10.0	317.99304962158203	34
infinity. The transcendental future perspective may contain goals such as being	40.35430145263672	361.4430847167969	10.0	317.9920425415039	34
reunited with deceased loved ones, eternal life, reincarnation, etc. According	40.35430145263672	372.9430847167969	10.0	317.9970474243164	34
to the authors, the transcendental future perspective is a personality trait with	40.35430145263672	384.4430847167969	10.0	318.00110626220703	34
individual differences; it also influences our present behaviour.	40.35430145263672	395.9430847167969	10.0	252.66602325439453	34
The main contribution of Boyd and Zimbardo (1997) has been to free the	50.35430145263672	407.4430847167969	10.0	307.98499298095703	34
future perspective from the physical limit imposed by death. Nevertheless, it is	40.35430145263672	418.9430847167969	10.0	317.9990921020508	34
important to underline that they insist on cognitive components of the transcen-	40.35430145263672	430.4430847167969	10.0	317.99503326416016	34
dental future perspective that are generally positive (being reunited with	40.35430145263672	441.9430847167969	10.0	317.99710845947266	34
deceased relatives, etc.). Just like the classical future perspective has affective	40.35430145263672	453.4430847167969	10.0	318.00797271728516	34
dimensions, be they negative (anxiety towards the future) or positive (hope,	40.35430145263672	464.9430847167969	10.000007629394531	317.9850540161133	34

article insists on the negative affective component, that is, death anxiety. Death	40.35430145263672	499.4430847167969	10.0	317.99109649658203	34
anxiety is rarely dealt with from the point of view of time, and yet it belongs to	40.35430145263672	510.943115234375	10.0	317.9910354614258	34

Death anxiety: A definition	48.0	90.88040161132812	10.0	115.80398559570312	38
Since the seminal work of Feifel (1955), more than 1,000 papers have dealt with	48.0	108.44308471679688	10.0	317.9900817871094	39
death anxiety, its definition, its causes and its behavioural consequences. Few	48.0	119.94308471679688	10.0	317.9920654296875	39
authors, among them Dickstein (1975), Neimeyer (1994), have ventured to	48.0	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.98602294921875	39
define the concept. On the basis of these various definitions, I will first give my	48.0	142.94308471679688	10.0	317.99810791015625	39
own definition of death anxiety and then outline its main characteristics. I define	48.0	154.44308471679688	10.0	318.0	39
death anxiety as a set of negative emotional reactions of variable intensity	48.0	165.94308471679688	10.0	318.0021057128906	39
induced by selfless anticipation (Urien, 2003). While many authors qualify	48.0	177.44308471679688	10.0	317.9941101074219	39
death anxiety as an emotional reaction, Neimeyer (1994) is more precise and,	48.0	188.94308471679688	10.0	318.0010070800781	39
under the generic name of death anxiety, includes ‘a set of attitudes character-	48.0	200.44308471679688	10.0	317.9969787597656	39
ized by fear, threat, anxiety, illness, discomfort, or any other similar negative	48.0	211.94308471679688	10.0	318.0010681152344	39
feeling’. Furthermore, recent attempts at defining death anxiety speak about ‘a	48.0	223.44308471679688	10.0	318.0020446777344	39
state during which the self does not exist’ (Tomer and Eliason, 1996). In the con-	48.0	234.94308471679688	10.0	317.99505615234375	39
text of time, we will speak about selfless anticipation. Nevertheless, whereas	48.0	246.44308471679688	10.0	318.0030517578125	39
early work presented death anxiety as a one-dimensional construct only	48.0	257.9430847167969	10.0	317.9951171875	39
(Templer, 1970), at the present time some authors wish to differentiate several	48.0	269.4430847167969	10.0	318.0039367675781	39
sub-dimensions of anxiety, such as the anxiety regarding one’s physical state	48.0	280.9430847167969	10.0	317.9841003417969	39
after death, one’s destruction, or the loss of one’s social identity. In actual fact,	48.0	292.4430847167969	10.0	318.00006103515625	39
according to Neimeyer (1994), it seems that there exists a general anxiety	48.0	303.9430847167969	10.0	318.0010070800781	39
towards the disappearance of one’s self. This general anxiety can then be sub-	48.0	315.4430847167969	10.0	317.9870300292969	39
divided according to the kind of thought – pertaining to death – that causes	48.0	326.9430847167969	10.0	317.9840087890625	39
anxiety (physical destruction, loss of one’s soul, loss of one’s identity, etc.)	48.0	338.4430847167969	10.0	317.9901123046875	39

Regarding behavioural reactions, various theories have shown that individuals	47.999996185302734	408.9430847167969	10.0	317.990177154541	41
develop different means of self-preservation. These means can be direct and/or	47.999996185302734	420.4430847167969	10.0	318.0030860900879	41
indirect, and take the form of physiological necessities and symbols respect-	47.999996185302734	431.9430847167969	10.0	317.9940528869629	41
ively. Theorists of death anxiety have only focused on symbolic forms in their	47.999996185302734	443.4430847167969	10.0	317.98312759399414	41
investigations. In this respect, two major consequences have appeared: the first	47.999996185302734	454.9430847167969	10.0	317.99094009399414	41
was developed in a pioneering theory, the Terror Management Theory (TMT)	47.999996185302734	466.4430847167969	10.000007629394531	317.998966217041	41
(Solomon et al., 1991), which deals with faith in a cultural world-view and self-	47.999996185302734	477.9430847167969	10.0	317.9940528869629	41
esteem, whereas the second deals with generativity and ‘outliving the self’	47.999996185302734	489.4430847167969	10.0	317.99606704711914	41

First identified by Jeff Greenberg, Tom Pyszczynski and Sheldon Solomon	40.35430145263672	68.443115234375	10.0	317.9921646118164	45
(Greenberg et al., 1990), TMT has been the subject of more than 200 empirical	40.35430145263672	79.943115234375	9.999969482421875	317.9920120239258	45
studies. It states that death anxiety is the emotional manifestation of the funda-	40.35430145263672	91.44308471679688	10.0	317.99308013916016	45
mental instinct of self-preservation. Preservation of the self may be fulfilled	40.35430145263672	102.94308471679688	10.0	318.00199127197266	45
through direct means (e.g. remaining healthy, avoiding bad food), but also, more	40.35430145263672	114.44308471679688	10.0	317.98719024658203	45
importantly, through symbolic means related to the individual’s culture. To	40.35430145263672	125.94308471679688	10.0	317.99109649658203	45
be more precise, there are two symbolic and closely linked self-preservation	40.35430145263672	137.44308471679688	10.0	317.9950637817383	45
mechanisms: (1) unfailing support of world-views and the values of one’s	40.35430145263672	148.94308471679688	10.0	317.9891128540039	45
culture, and (2) increase in self-esteem – a goal that may be reached by adopting	40.35430145263672	160.44308471679688	10.0	318.0000991821289	45
culturally valued behaviours. Concerning adaptation based on faith in a cultural	40.35430145263672	171.94308471679688	10.0	317.99112701416016	45
world-view, the theory states that we construct a culture and take part in it so as	40.35430145263672	183.44308471679688	10.0	318.0131301879883	45
to minimize the concern associated with death or the loss of self. While culture	40.35430145263672	194.94308471679688	10.0	317.9960708618164	45
can offer immortality through religion, it also contributes to creating a cultural	40.35430145263672	206.44308471679688	10.0	318.00406646728516	45

viduals. As for adaptation grounded on self-esteem, the more an individual	40.35430145263672	229.44308471679688	10.0	317.98706817626953	45
subscribes to and respects the values of his/her culture, the more his/her self-	40.35430145263672	240.94308471679688	10.0	317.9929885864258	45
esteem increases and the less anxious he/she feels about his/her own death.	40.35430145263672	252.44308471679688	10.0	317.99402618408203	45
Experimental studies have shown that behavioural adaptation, for example,	40.35430145263672	263.9430847167969	10.0	317.9960403442383	45
could lead to: (1) risky behaviour (Orit Taubman Ben-Ari, 2000), (2) conspicu-	40.35430145263672	275.4430847167969	10.0	317.9900588989258	45

ity’, Kotre (1984) considers it to be a kind of ‘outliving of the self’. After	40.35430145263672	367.4430847167969	10.019317626953125	318.00098419189453	47
presenting the concept of generativity, this part will highlight one of its possible	40.35430908203125	378.9430847167969	10.0	317.99322509765625	47
manifestations, that is, ‘time capsules’.	40.35430908203125	390.4430847167969	10.0	155.7799835205078	47
The concept of generativity was first introduced by Erik Erikson (1963) over	50.35430908203125	401.9430847167969	10.0	307.9920654296875	47
40 years ago. ‘Generativity versus stagnation’ is the seventh of the eight stages	40.35430908203125	413.4430847167969	10.0	317.99200439453125	47
in Erikson’s human life cycle theory. It is first associated with the middle adult	40.35430908203125	424.9430847167969	10.0	318.0011291503906	47

However, a broader definition of this concept includes different life settings,	40.35430908203125	447.9430847167969	10.0	318.00201416015625	47
such as ‘professional activities, volunteer endeavours, participation in religious	40.35430908203125	459.4430847167969	10.000007629394531	317.9950866699219	47
and political organizations, neighbourhood and community activism, friendship	40.35430908203125	470.9430847167969	10.0	317.98907470703125	47
and even leisure time pursuits’ (McAdams and de St. Aubin, 1998). McAdams	40.35430908203125	482.4430847167969	10.0	317.9901428222656	47
and de St. Aubin (1998) suggested a typology of generativity that includes	40.35430908203125	493.9430847167969	10.0	317.98309326171875	47
different generative behaviours (McAdams and de St. Aubin, 1992): creating,	40.35430908203125	505.443115234375	10.0	317.994140625	47
maintaining and offering one’s self. By ‘creating’, the authors mean a generative	40.35430908203125	516.943115234375	10.0	317.99395751953125	47

both (McAdams et al., 1998). It involves ‘the creation of a product or legacy in	48.0	62.443115234375	10.0	317.9870300292969	50
one’s own image . . . a powerful extension of the self (idem)’ (McAdams et al.,	48.0	73.943115234375	9.999969482421875	317.9920349121094	50
1998: 23) as well. ‘Maintaining’ is another kind of generative behaviour. It	48.0	85.44308471679688	10.0	317.9860534667969	50
consists of the conservation or the preservation behaviours that are valued.	48.0	96.94308471679688	10.0	317.99505615234375	50
McAdams et al. (1998) mention behaviours such as preserving good traditions.	48.0	108.44308471679688	10.0	317.985107421875	50
‘Offering’ corresponds to the offering or the gifts of things that have previously	48.0	119.94308471679688	10.0	317.9931640625	50
been created and maintained, or the handing down of something or someone	48.0	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.98016357421875	50
to the next generation. This can be understood as a way of extending one’s	48.0	142.94308471679688	10.0	317.9841003417969	50
existence beyond physical death to reach symbolic immortality. According to	48.0	154.44308471679688	10.0	317.9951171875	50
McAdams et al. (1998), ‘generativity is tied up with a society’s overall concep-	48.0	165.94308471679688	10.0	317.9890441894531	50
tion of time’. If we are talking about creating new things or human beings that	48.0	177.44308471679688	10.0	317.9860534667969	50
will outlive the self, generativity then deals with the long-term future.	48.0	188.94308471679688	10.0	317.998046875	50
Maintaining, preserving and passing on goods and traditions point to the past.	48.0	200.44308471679688	10.0	317.9811706542969	50
Therefore, by creating a link between different generations, generativity bridges	48.0	211.94308471679688	10.0	318.0040283203125	50
the past and the future. Generativity could induce such behaviours as ecologi-	48.0	223.44308471679688	10.0	317.9910583496094	50
cally friendly behaviour (Urien and Kilbourne, 2007).	48.0	234.94308471679688	10.0	215.45803833007812	50
An illustration and manifestation of the concept of generativity is the	58.0	246.44308471679688	10.0	308.0000305175781	50
phenomenon of ‘time capsules’. A time capsule contains goods and/or informa-	48.0	257.9430847167969	10.0	317.9950866699219	50
tion that are representative of life at a given point in time, and which could	48.0	269.4430847167969	10.0	317.99908447265625	50
be used as a means of communication with people in the future. The common	48.0	280.9430847167969	10.0	317.9910888671875	50
characteristic of all existing time capsules is probably the need to transcend the	48.0	292.4430847167969	10.0	317.99310302734375	50
end of one’s personal future by means of a gift that reflects a given period of	48.0	303.9430847167969	10.0	317.99700927734375	50
time, the need to preserve it and to pass it on to future generations.	48.0	315.4430847167969	10.0	266.28106689453125	50
I have previously discussed how temporal orientation, and more specifically	58.0	326.9430847167969	10.0	307.99005126953125	50
the personal future, has been considered and dimensioned almost exclusively as	48.0	338.4430847167969	10.0	317.9931335449219	50
a ‘life space’. Yet philosophically and psychologically, certain authors show	48.0	349.9430847167969	10.0	317.9891052246094	50
that the representation of the future cannot be envisaged without integrating the	48.0	361.4430847167969	10.0	317.9971923828125	50
anticipation of self-absence: death. I have insisted here on the affective dimen-	48.0	372.9430847167969	10.0	317.9970703125	50
sion linked to this anticipation: death anxiety. Its main behavioural influences	48.0	384.4430847167969	10.0	317.9910888671875	50
have also been introduced. In part two, I aim to examine in depth the relations	48.0	395.9430847167969	10.0	317.9860534667969	50
between death anxiety and certain traditional dimensions of the future. If death	48.0	407.4430847167969	10.0	317.99603271484375	50
anxiety belongs to the structure of the personal future, what are the links and the	48.0	418.9430847167969	10.0	317.9861145019531	50
intensity of these links with the traditional dimensions of temporal orientation	48.0	430.4430847167969	10.0	318.0010986328125	50
and those of the personal future in particular? Is future anxiety linked to death	48.0	441.9430847167969	10.0	317.988037109375	50
anxiety? Do individuals orientated towards the future have the same intensity of	48.0	453.4430847167969	10.0	317.9951171875	50
death anxiety as individuals orientated towards the past or the present? These are	48.0	464.9430847167969	10.000007629394531	317.9909973144531	50

anxiety. Bascue et al. (1977) have shown, for example, that based on a sample	40.35420227050781	85.94308471679688	10.0	317.98411560058594	54
of 88 77-year-old Americans, death anxiety is associated with an orientation	40.35420227050781	97.44308471679688	10.0	317.9951629638672	54
towards the future (Bascue et al., 1977). Dickstein (1975), based on a sample of	40.35420227050781	108.94308471679688	10.0	317.9940948486328	54
185 American students and using Thematic Aperception Test (TAT) tests to	40.35420227050781	120.44308471679688	10.0	317.99900817871094	54
measure temporal orientation, has shown a link between orientation towards the	40.35420227050781	131.94308471679688	10.0	317.9930877685547	54
past and death anxiety. However, no links were found with an orientation	40.35420227050781	143.44308471679688	10.0	317.9861297607422	54
towards the future. What then are the links with other temporal dimensions? On	40.35420227050781	154.94308471679688	10.0	317.9990692138672	54
other groups? On different age categories? On different cultures? By using other	40.35420227050781	166.44308471679688	10.0	317.9970245361328	54

This study will contribute to answering these questions by studying more	50.35420227050781	189.44308471679688	10.0	307.98912048339844	54

dominant orientation towards the future. In contrast with these dimensions	40.35420227050781	212.44308471679688	10.0	317.99913024902344	54

developed in recent years due to an interest in a better understanding of the	40.35420227050781	420.9430847167969	10.0	317.99607849121094	58

quences. Robert Neimeyer, of the University of Memphis, is currently the	40.35420227050781	443.9430847167969	10.0	317.98912048339844	58
specialist in this area. Although numerous indicators can be noted at the present	40.35420227050781	455.4430847167969	10.0	317.99598693847656	58

lights two important problems: discordant definitions of the concept and a lack	40.35420227050781	478.4430847167969	10.0	317.98802185058594	58
of a theoretical base, to the point that St-Amour and Kiely (2000) ask if the	40.35420227050781	489.9430847167969	10.0	317.99009704589844	58
function of the death anxiety scale is to define the concept. From the middle of	40.35420227050781	501.4430847167969	10.0	317.9931182861328	58
the 1950s until the end of the 1970s, indirect tests with a projective tendency	40.35420227050781	512.943115234375	10.0	317.9800262451172	58
were used. Among these tests I note, for example, the 10 ‘TAT’ drawings that	40.35420227050781	524.443115234375	9.999996185302734	317.9870147705078	58

refer to death (Epley and Rick, 1963, cited in Dickstein, 1975). However, the	48.0	50.943115234375	10.0	317.9901428222656	61
creation and the use of these tools rapidly declined, notably due to the cumber-	48.0	62.443115234375	10.0	317.9820556640625	61
someness of an important manipulation, a lack of validity and reliability, and the	48.0	73.943115234375	9.999969482421875	317.9890441894531	61
arrival of much more practical attitude scales that made it possible to directly	48.0	85.44308471679688	10.0	318.0010986328125	61
apprehend death anxiety. In fact, 95 percent of the studies published in psy-	48.0	96.94308471679688	10.0	317.9801330566406	61
chology on this topic use these types of test (Neimeyer, 1997–8). Among the	48.0	108.44308471679688	10.0	317.988037109375	61
better known, we cite Templer’s (1970) ‘Death Anxiety Scale (D.A.S)’, Colett	48.0	119.94308471679688	10.0	317.99505615234375	61
and Lester’s (1969) the ‘Fear of Death Scale (F.D.S)’, Neimeyer’s (1994)	48.0	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.9989929199219	61
‘Threat Index (T.I)’ and Dickstein’s (1975) ‘Death Concern Scale (D.C.S)’.	48.0	142.94308471679688	10.0	317.99896240234375	61
Moreover, the last scale is composed of 30 items and 2 dimensions: one dimen-	48.0	154.44308471679688	10.0	317.9901428222656	61
sion representing the conscious meditation of death, and a second dimension	48.0	165.94308471679688	10.0	317.9861145019531	61
representing a negative evaluation of it. However, only the second factor is con-	48.0	177.44308471679688	10.0	317.98797607421875	61
sidered as specifically characterizing death anxiety. The other dimension does	48.0	188.94308471679688	10.0	317.9951477050781	61
not correspond to negative emotional reaction towards death but to the con-	48.0	200.44308471679688	10.0	317.9850158691406	61
sciousness of it. In addition, a more recent analysis (Klug and Boss, 1976) shows	48.0	211.94308471679688	10.0	317.9861145019531	61
that the factor relative to death anxiety is only composed of five items. I can also	48.0	223.44308471679688	10.0	317.99212646484375	61

predominant temporal orientation towards the past and the predominant orienta-	48.0	349.9430847167969	10.0	317.99310302734375	63
tion towards the future. This scale offers very good psychometric qualities and	48.0	361.4430847167969	10.0	317.9970703125	63
has often been used (partially or completely) on various and numerous popula-	48.0	372.9430847167969	10.0	317.99310302734375	63

in many relatively recent publications (for a summary, see Usunier and Valette-	48.0	395.9430847167969	10.0	318.0050354003906	63

This scale does not take into account present-orientation. I have used one of	58.0	418.9430847167969	10.0	307.9860534667969	63
the dimensions of the temporal orientations scale developed by Ko and Gentry	48.0	430.4430847167969	10.0	317.9830322265625	63
(1991), and by Gentry (1993) for this specific dimension. The reliability of the	48.0	441.9430847167969	10.0	317.9931335449219	63
measure of this dimension is adequate (α = 0.74). The authors have attempted to	48.0	453.2789001464844	10.1641845703125	317.9949951171875	63
test the intercultural validity of these scales on two samples (American and	48.0	464.9430847167969	10.000007629394531	317.9969787597656	63

Concerning future anxiety, we have used Zaleski’s scale (1996). This one-	58.0	499.4430847167969	10.0	307.9880065917969	63
dimensional scale, tested and validated on several American and Polish samples,	48.0	510.943115234375	10.0	317.9920654296875	63
has good psychometric qualities. It is composed of 29 items in all, 4 of which are	48.0	522.443115234375	9.999996185302734	317.9939880371094	63

in relation to other ones that are conceptually close, the author correlated the	40.35430145263672	62.443115234375	10.0	318.00110626220703	66
Polish version of this scale with other anxiety scales. The coefficients obtained	40.35430145263672	73.943115234375	9.999969482421875	317.9930191040039	66
show that this type of anxiety is close to traditional conceptions of anxiety, be it	40.35430145263672	85.44308471679688	10.0	317.9931106567383	66

(r = 0.61, N = 135). In fact, if all of these results show that all of these scales	40.35328674316406	119.94308471679688	10.019317626953125	318.0029754638672	66
belong to the same network of the conceptual sphere of anxiety, the scale of	40.35428237915039	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.99306869506836	66

ing utility. Finally, this scale shows encouraging psychometric qualities as well	40.35428237915039	154.44308471679688	10.0	317.990047454834	66
as a cross-cultural method central to the process of creating a scale.	40.35428237915039	165.94308471679688	10.0	269.30102157592773	66

I have worked from two samples of individuals of French origin: one sample of	40.35428237915039	211.94308471679688	10.0	317.9860496520996	68
349 young adults (average age: 21) and a sample of 302 older adults (average	40.35428237915039	223.44308471679688	10.0	317.990047454834	68
age: 47). Six hundred and fifty-one questionnaires were then used for the data	40.35428237915039	234.94308471679688	10.0	317.98705673217773	68
analysis. According to the works of Gesser et al. (1987), the individuals in their	40.35428237915039	246.44308471679688	10.0	317.98806381225586	68
40s would have a higher death anxiety than the individuals belonging to other	40.35428237915039	257.9430847167969	10.0	317.9761619567871	68
age groups. In fact, these two samples have multiple interests: they allow us to	40.35428237915039	269.4430847167969	10.0	317.9900779724121	68
have differences in mean age that are important enough to detect a potential	40.35428237915039	280.9430847167969	10.0	317.9930992126465	68
variation in the intensity of the level of death anxiety whatever the meaning of	40.35428237915039	292.4430847167969	10.0	317.99197006225586	68
this variation. It also makes it possible to analyse the stability of relations	40.35428237915039	303.9430847167969	10.0	318.0020408630371	68
between death anxiety and the different traditional temporal dimensions.	40.35428237915039	315.4430847167969	10.0	317.9991111755371	68
Considering the size of our samples and the nature of our variables, I have	40.35428237915039	326.9430847167969	10.0	317.98998641967773	68
retained more specifically the method of estimation according to the maximum	40.35428237915039	338.4430847167969	10.0	318.0050926208496	68
likelihood. Concerning the translation of the scales into French, I have used the	40.35428237915039	349.9430847167969	10.0	317.9880027770996	68
technique of blind parallel translation: each of the three translators involved	40.35428237915039	361.4430847167969	10.0	318.00197982788086	68

pendently, then the different versions were compared and a final version was	40.35428237915039	384.4430847167969	10.0	317.9980125427246	68

As recommended by Klug and Boss (1976), the texts were administered to the	40.35428237915039	441.9430847167969	10.0	317.98900985717773	70
two samples in its original version. An exploratory factorial analysis then made	40.35428237915039	453.4430847167969	10.0	317.991024017334	70
it possible to keep items whose ‘loadings’ were superior to 0.50 on one factor	40.35428237915039	464.9430847167969	10.000007629394531	317.9860496520996	70
and weak on the other factor. My analysis was based uniquely on the dimension	40.35428237915039	476.4430847167969	10.0	317.9891014099121	70
concerning death anxiety. This analysis permitted me to find again the five items	40.35428237915039	487.9430847167969	10.0	317.99404525756836	70
that specifically measure death anxiety. A confirmatory analysis to one latent	40.35428237915039	499.4430847167969	10.0	318.00304794311523	70
factor and five variables of measure was then realized. Validation of the	40.35428237915039	510.943115234375	10.0	317.99901962280273	70

final specified model of measure with the data is satisfactory on the two samples	48.0	50.943115234375	10.0	318.00201416015625	73
(comparative fit index [CFI*] of 0.99/0.98). The reliability tests give satis-	48.0	62.443115234375	10.0	318.00311279296875	73
factory results. Indeed, the calculation of Joreskog’s ρ gives a result of 0.88 for	48.0	73.7789306640625	10.164154052734375	317.9980163574219	73

vergent validity, I retained only three indictors: a significant link between the	48.000030517578125	96.94308471679688	10.0	317.9991149902344	73
variables of measure and their latent factor, satisfactory criteria of adjustment	48.000030517578125	108.44308471679688	10.0	318.0100402832031	73
and, finally, factorial weights > 0.5. Since all of the criteria have been observed,	48.000030517578125	119.94308471679688	10.0	317.99090576171875	73
we can then conclude that the reliability is good and that the validity of the scale	48.000030517578125	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.9920654296875	73

The exploratory factorial analysis done on the 25 statements showed the	48.000030517578125	188.94308471679688	10.0	317.9901428222656	75
existence of a main factor on the two samples. I therefore retained the first	48.000030517578125	200.44308471679688	10.0	318.00799560546875	75
component and specified a model of measure to one factor. In the end, I obtained	48.000030517578125	211.94308471679688	10.0	317.9910583496094	75
a one-dimensional structure and 13 variables from the 2 samples. These	48.000030517578125	223.44308471679688	10.0	317.99102783203125	75
variables have a significant liaison with their latent factor. The adequacy of the	48.000030517578125	234.94308471679688	10.0	318.0030517578125	75
specified models of measure with the data is very satisfactory (CFI* of	48.000030517578125	246.44308471679688	10.0	317.99700927734375	75

Regarding orientation towards the present, a confirmatory analysis with a	58.00006103515625	430.4430847167969	10.0	307.9971008300781	77

the different variables shows that they express an active search for pleasure very	48.00006103515625	453.4430847167969	10.0	317.99700927734375	77
close to hedonism. The quality of the fit index are excellent for both the samples	48.00006103515625	464.9430847167969	10.000007629394531	317.9971008300781	77

After having examined the psychometric quality of each scale, we can now	40.35430145263672	281.16680908203125	10.0	317.9870376586914	90

The analysis of the results shows that death anxiety is positively and signifi-	50.35430145263672	373.16680908203125	10.0	307.9861526489258	90

The calculation of the Z test gives us a result of 3.17. Since the result is	58.0	234.94308471679688	10.0	307.985107421875	102
superior to 1.96, the bilateral mean comparison test shows that the differences in	48.0	246.44308471679688	10.0	317.99700927734375	102
death anxiety are significant, p = 5 per cent. In our samples, death anxiety felt at	48.0	257.9430847167969	10.019317626953125	317.9909973144531	102

According to Byrne’s (1994) recommendations on the subject, studying the	48.0	326.9430847167969	10.0	317.984130859375	104

of measure and the parameters of correlation on several samples. This is pre-	48.0	361.4430847167969	10.0	318.00006103515625	104
cisely why I worked with two samples: one made up of young adults, the other	48.0	372.9430847167969	10.0	317.9791259765625	104
of older adults. In order to do so, I used Lagrange’s test, which evaluates the	48.0	384.4430847167969	10.0	317.9840393066406	104
effects of liberating the parameters fixed in the initial specified model on	48.0	395.9430847167969	10.0	318.00616455078125	104

the model. I then followed the classical method recommended by Byrne and I	48.0	418.9430847167969	10.0	317.9910583496094	104
then simultaneously tested the invariance of the measurement models and the	48.0	430.4430847167969	10.0	317.9960021972656	104
invariance of the correlation links. I set constraints of equality between the	48.0	441.9430847167969	10.0	318.0030822753906	104
parameters of measure (coefficients of regression of the different variables of	48.0	453.4430847167969	10.0	318.01202392578125	104
measure on their latent factor) for the two samples, and constraints of equality	48.0	464.9430847167969	10.000007629394531	318.0010681152344	104

on the sample of older adults. The analysis of the results show that the quality of	48.0	499.4430847167969	10.0	317.9831848144531	104
the multi-group model seemed satisfactory on the whole (Chi square = 1458, d.f.	48.0	510.943115234375	10.0	317.98199462890625	104

invariance in the instrument of measure on the two samples. However, this	40.35430145263672	73.943115234375	9.999969482421875	317.99011993408203	107

The analysis of the results is interesting for several reasons. First, I have to admit	40.35430908203125	247.94308471679688	10.0	318.0009765625	109
that fundamental dimensions such as the predominant temporal orientation and	40.35430908203125	259.4430847167969	10.0	317.99310302734375	109
future anxiety are empirically linked to death anxiety, and this on two samples	40.35430908203125	270.9430847167969	10.0	317.9920654296875	109

In a more detailed approach, one will observe at first the important links	40.35430908203125	293.9430847167969	10.0	317.9911193847656	109

death anxiety). If some results have shown positive links between short-term	40.35432434082031	316.9430847167969	10.0	317.99513244628906	109
classical anxiety and death anxiety, my study shows that these links also exist	40.35432434082031	328.4430847167969	10.0	317.9921417236328	109
when anxiety towards a more distinct future is taken into account. If, as stated by	40.35432434082031	339.9430847167969	10.0	317.99400329589844	109
Zaleski (1996), this future anxiety excludes death anxiety in that it refers to a	40.35432434082031	351.4430847167969	10.0	317.98899841308594	109
future that ‘we will live and act in’, death can be, however, considered as a	40.35432434082031	362.9430847167969	10.0	317.98802185058594	109
singular event of that future; and, life after death as a particular period of the	40.35432434082031	374.4430847167969	10.0	318.0029754638672	109
latter. The correlation between future anxiety and death anxiety can be inter-	40.35432434082031	385.9430847167969	10.0	317.99806213378906	109
preted in the following manner: the more one is anxious faced with one’s life	40.35432434082031	397.4430847167969	10.0	317.99998474121094	109
space, the more one is anxious faced with one’s death space.	40.35432434082031	408.9430847167969	10.0	242.1009979248047	109
The existence of a liaison, albeit moderate, with orientation towards the future	50.35432434082031	420.4430847167969	10.0	308.0040740966797	109
is initially more surprising. In fact, it can be considered that the fact of being	40.35432434082031	431.9430847167969	10.0	317.99095153808594	109
orientated in a predominant way by inclination towards one’s future goes hand	40.35432434082031	443.4430847167969	10.0	317.9930877685547	109
in hand with a more acute consciousness of the limits of this future and hence a	40.35432434082031	454.9430847167969	10.0	317.98606872558594	109
more pronounced anxiety regarding it.	40.35432434082031	466.4430847167969	10.000007629394531	153.54397583007812	109
The links with orientation towards the past are more pronounced but still	50.35432434082031	477.9430847167969	10.0	307.9970245361328	109
positive. These results confirm those of Dickstein (1975: 154): orientation	40.35432434082031	489.4430847167969	10.0	317.99510192871094	109
towards the past could be ‘a direct consequence of the consciousness of death	40.35432434082031	500.9430847167969	10.0	317.9880828857422	109
and represents an attempt to be content with the experience and to resist the	40.35432434082031	512.443115234375	10.0	317.99009704589844	109
rapid passing of time’. Finally, a very reduced negative link with orientation	40.35432434082031	523.943115234375	9.999996185302734	317.98912048339844	109

towards the present, stable on the two samples, is observed. The more one would	48.0	50.943115234375	10.0	317.99005126953125	112
be anxious faced with death, the less one would be orientated towards the	48.0	62.443115234375	10.0	317.9900207519531	112
present that consists in the active search for pleasure. However, the low intensi-	48.0	73.943115234375	9.999969482421875	317.99505615234375	112

Regarding the modifying effect of age, the result obtained shows that an older	58.0	96.94308471679688	10.0	307.9970397949219	112
age provokes a slight significant increase in death anxiety. These results are in	48.0	108.44308471679688	10.0	317.9940185546875	112
accordance with those of Gesser et al. (1987), who have observed the existence	48.0	119.94308471679688	10.0	317.98907470703125	112
of a curvilinear relation between the two variables, namely, that death anxiety is	48.0	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.9970703125	112
highest during mid-life.	48.0	142.94308471679688	10.0	94.69700622558594	112

The following observation was the starting point of this article: apart from the	48.0	201.94308471679688	10.0	317.9951171875	114
work done by Boyd and Zimbardo (1997), work pertaining to the psychology of	48.0	213.44308471679688	10.0	317.9700927734375	114
time considers the personal future principally as a life space. Yet this personal	48.0	224.94308471679688	10.0	318.0000305175781	114
future is flexible enough to enable individuals to project themselves well beyond	48.0	236.44308471679688	10.0	317.9901428222656	114
this life space into a post-mortem future. Therefore, I suggested taking the	48.0	247.94308471679688	10.0	317.9999694824219	114
concept of death anxiety into account in the structure of the future. If philo-	48.0	259.4430847167969	10.0	317.99395751953125	114
sophical reflection precedes scientific reflection, it seems important that	48.0	270.9430847167969	10.0	318.0060729980469	114
researchers studying the influence of time representations on human behaviour,	48.0	282.4430847167969	10.0	317.9930725097656	114
for example consumer behaviour, should not limit themselves to apprehending	48.0	293.9430847167969	10.0	317.9901428222656	114
the future as a life space. It is also important that they explore the personal future	48.0	305.4430847167969	10.0	317.9950256347656	114
that projects us beyond our physical death and induces behavioural reactions,	48.0	316.9430847167969	10.0	317.9840393066406	114
such as the ones presented earlier.	48.0	328.4430847167969	10.0	136.03599548339844	114
The consequences, in terms of future research, present different aspects:	58.0	339.9430847167969	10.0	288.447998046875	114
• Beyond the connections with the traditional temporal dimensions of the	48.0	357.4430847167969	10.0	317.986083984375	115
personal future, what are the links with the other future dimensions such as	56.375	368.9430847167969	10.0	309.62310791015625	115
‘Consideration of Future Consequences’, ‘Future Time Perspective’, ‘Hope’?	56.375	380.4430847167969	10.0	309.5870361328125	115
• I have studied here the role of age as a moderating variable of the links	48.0	391.9430847167969	10.0	317.9950866699219	115
between death anxiety and certain traditional temporal dimensions. In spite of	56.375	403.4430847167969	10.0	309.6230773925781	115
a slight increase in death anxiety during ageing, I have empirically shown that	56.375	414.9430847167969	10.0	309.62298583984375	115
the intensity of the links with the other temporal dimensions is invariant.	56.375	426.4430847167969	10.0	309.6160888671875	115
Likewise, studying the role of another moderating variable, such as religiosity,	56.375	437.9430847167969	10.0	309.6210632324219	115
would be interesting.	56.375	449.4430847167969	10.0	84.1400146484375	115
• In the present article, I have mainly insisted on the negative affect pertaining	48.0	460.9430847167969	10.000007629394531	317.99603271484375	115
to post-mortem ideas (e.g. loss of social identity). Nevertheless, some authors	56.375	472.4430847167969	10.0	309.6220703125	115
underline an aspect that has been rather neglected by academia, namely the	56.375	483.9430847167969	10.0	309.61505126953125	115
manifestations of death acceptation (Wong, 2000). In fact, one of the possible	56.375	495.4430847167969	10.0	309.6201171875	115
means of defending oneself against the anxiety associated with ‘not being	56.375	506.943115234375	10.0	309.61810302734375	115
anymore’ is to do away with the desire to ‘be’ by cutting oneself off from the	56.375	518.443115234375	10.0	309.6180114746094	115

1. Two meanings of temporal orientation are found in the literature: the strict sense of	44.85430145263672	121.24774169921875	9.0	313.50601959228516	120
temporal orientation which corresponds to ‘the predominant orientation’ towards	56.10430145263672	131.24765014648438	9.0	302.25077056884766	120
one or the other traditional temporal zones (past, present, future) and the broader	56.10430145263672	141.24755859375	9.0	302.24707794189453	120
sense of the term, which encompasses all of the temporal dimensions concerning the	56.10430145263672	151.24746704101562	9.0	302.2479934692383	120
representation of time. The latter is used in this introduction.	56.10430145263672	161.24737548828125	9.0	218.17542266845703	120
