Abstract	113.25	106.00494384765625	15.75	64.39775085449219	11
Globalization here is understood to be a multicentric, multiscalar, multitemporal, multiform,	113.25	143.2054443359375	9.75	410.13873291015625	12
and multicausal process, which has much less of an explanans and more of an	113.25	158.9554443359375	9.75	410.91595458984375	12
explanandum. In recent analysis globalization has been found to be about place, space, and	113.25	173.9554443359375	9.75	410.83209228515625	12
scale. Yet, following its title, this paper argues that it is about time too. In other words,	113.25	189.7054443359375	9.75	408.88153076171875	12
globalization is also a spatio-temporal process. The nature of this process, its relation with	113.25	205.4554443359375	9.75	410.12127685546875	12
the development of capitalist economies and the role of the state, are at the core of this	113.25	220.4554443359375	9.75	409.49920654296875	12
paper.	113.25	236.2054443359375	9.75	25.85675048828125	12
Zusammenfassung	113.25	280.00494384765625	15.75	145.36795043945312	13
Globalisierung wird hier als Prozess verstanden mit vielfältigen Ursachen und	113.25	317.2054443359375	9.75	410.94036865234375	14
Ausprägungen, mit zeitlichen und räumlichen Aspekten sowie einer polyzentrischen Natur.	113.25	332.9554443359375	9.75	409.64459228515625	14
Dabei wird Globalisierung weniger als erklärendes, sondern vielmehr als zu erklärendes	113.25	347.9554443359375	9.75	408.7855224609375	14
Phänomen gedeutet. In der gegenwärtigen sozialwissenschaftlichen Analyse wird	113.25	363.7054443359375	9.75	410.875732421875	14
Globalisierung in Zusammenhang mit örtlichen, räumlichen und skalaren Veränderungen	113.25	379.4554443359375	9.75	408.8204345703125	14
gebracht. Wie der Titel dieses Papiers aber andeutet, handelt es sich ebenso um ein	113.25	394.4554443359375	9.75	408.257568359375	14
zeitbezogenes Phänomen: Globalisierung wird somit als räumlich-zeitlicher Prozess	113.25	410.2054443359375	9.75	410.83355712890625	14
verstanden. Die Natur dieses Prozesses, seine Verbindungen mit der Entwicklung	113.25	425.9554443359375	9.75	410.9007568359375	14
kapitalistischer Ökonomien und die Rolle des Staates werden im Fokus dieser Arbeit stehen.	113.25	440.9554443359375	9.75	407.174560546875	14

The title of this paper involves a deliberate play on words. It is also meant to make some	113.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	410.0242919921875	38
serious theoretical and political points about the nature of globalization. It is certainly not	113.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	409.6890869140625	38
about time that we begin to talk of globalization. On the contrary, the time is now well past	113.25	139.4554443359375	9.75	410.16912841796875	38
when it first began to be seriously questioned. Indeed, for many commentators, it is high time	113.25	155.2054443359375	9.75	410.1805419921875	38
that the concept of globalization was banned. Nor does the title indicate that strategies to	113.25	170.9554443359375	9.75	409.9639892578125	38
promote globalization are overdue and that it is about time that the globalization project was	113.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	410.72650146484375	38
taken further. Instead the title is intended to suggest that it is high time that we recognized –	113.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	410.4210205078125	38
both theoretically and politically – that globalization is not just about place, space, and scale.	113.25	217.4554443359375	9.75	410.81329345703125	38
It is about time too. Globalization is a phenomenon of a ‘runaway world,’ of the annihilation of	113.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	410.85552978515625	38
distance by time, of the increasing acceleration of social events and processes. And, to go	113.25	248.2054443359375	9.75	410.267822265625	38
further, it is a phenomenon that causes problems as much, if not more, because of its	113.25	263.9554443359375	9.75	408.78497314453125	38
complex temporalities as it does because of its complex spatialities. In short, if we are to	113.25	278.9554443359375	9.75	408.83447265625	38
understand and control globalization, it is about time that we realized that it is a spatio-	113.25	294.7054443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	38
temporal process.	113.25	310.4554443359375	9.75	79.39274597167969	38
In developing this argument, I first critique some recent simplified ideas about globalization,	113.25	341.2054443359375	9.75	410.18853759765625	39
insisting on its many complexities and suggesting that the concept of globalization would be	113.25	356.9554443359375	9.75	410.7039794921875	39
better seen as an explanandum than as an explanans. Second, building on the multicentric,	113.25	371.9554443359375	9.75	410.68511962890625	39
multiscalar, and multitemporal features of globalization as well as the notions of time-space	113.25	387.7054443359375	9.75	410.8026123046875	39
distantiation and time-space compression, I argue that the spatial turn involved in many	113.25	403.4554443359375	9.75	409.488037109375	39
recent discussions of globalization has been overdone and that it is time to combine it with a	113.25	418.4554443359375	9.75	410.734130859375	39
temporal (re)turn that can do justice to the complex spatio-temporalities of globalization. I	113.25	434.2054443359375	9.75	409.77520751953125	39
illustrate this argument from Marx’s work on the political economy of capitalism and,	113.25	449.9554443359375	9.75	410.89251708984375	39
especially, his analysis of the spatio-temporal dynamics that are generated by its	113.25	464.9554443359375	9.75	410.82257080078125	39
organization as an economy of time. Third, in this context I introduce the concept of	113.25	480.7054443359375	9.75	410.92626953125	39
spacetime and spatio-temporal fixes and draw out some of the theoretical implications of	113.25	496.4554443359375	9.75	409.53594970703125	39
such fixes for understanding the nature and problems of globalization. Fourth, I explore	113.25	511.4554443359375	9.75	408.7447509765625	39
some of the temporal contradictions of the current globalizing phase of a post-Fordist,	113.25	527.2054443359375	9.75	410.84429931640625	39
knowledge-based capitalism. Fifth, in the light of these remarks, I consider the implications of	113.25	542.9554443359375	9.75	410.83343505859375	39
globalization for the national state, noting in particular the challenges to its temporal	113.25	557.9554443359375	9.75	408.76910400390625	39
sovereignty. Here I consider the politics of time involved in globalization, the ways in which	113.25	573.7054443359375	9.75	410.21759033203125	39
this challenges the national sovereign state and the practices of democratic politics, and then	113.25	589.4554443359375	9.75	410.8028564453125	39
suggest some ways to address the acceleration of economic processes associated with the	113.25	604.4554443359375	9.75	410.2359619140625	39
current wave of globalization. My reflections conclude with some general remarks on the	113.25	620.2054443359375	9.75	409.44384765625	39
importance of temporality to an understanding and critique of globalization.	113.25	635.9554443359375	9.75	328.4317932128906	39

1. Globalization	71.25	106.75494384765625	15.75	117.66944885253906	41
‘Globalization’ is a polyvalent, promiscuous, controversial word that often obscures more	71.25	143.2054443359375	9.75	409.1871643066406	42
than it reveals about recent economic, political, social, and cultural changes. It is best used	71.25	158.9554443359375	9.75	409.7355041503906	42
to denote a multicentric, multiscalar, multitemporal, multiform, and multicausal process.	71.25	173.9554443359375	9.75	383.9188232421875	42
First, it is multicentric because it emerges from activities in many places rather than from a	71.25	205.4554443359375	9.75	410.1402587890625	43
single centre. It cannot be reduced to Americanization, as some critics of American	71.25	220.4554443359375	9.75	410.8939208984375	43
imperialism suggest, but emanates from many sites around the globe. Moreover, even if one	71.25	236.2054443359375	9.75	410.790771484375	43
were to insist against the evidence that it was primarily an American-initiated phenomenon, it	71.25	251.9554443359375	9.75	410.64007568359375	43
would still be necessary to recognize the plurality of globalization processes and effects	71.25	266.9554443359375	9.75	409.29559326171875	43
depending on whether one looked at American influences emanating from New York as a	71.25	282.7054443359375	9.75	408.955322265625	43
financial centre, Washington as an imperial city, Atlanta as a global news factory, Hollywood	71.25	298.4554443359375	9.75	410.8192443847656	43
as an entertainment capital, Silicon Valley as the centre of informational capitalism, and so	71.25	313.4554443359375	9.75	410.217041015625	43
on. The same point would apply, of course, to the alleged centrality of other national	71.25	329.2054443359375	9.75	408.84918212890625	43
formations.	71.25	344.9554443359375	9.75	49.383506774902344	43
Second, globalization is multiscalar because it emerges from actions on many scales –	71.25	375.7054443359375	9.75	411.1709899902344	44
which can no longer be seen as nested in a neat hierarchy but as co-existing and	71.25	391.4554443359375	9.75	409.34649658203125	44
interpenetrating in a tangled and confused manner – and it develops and deepens the scalar	71.25	406.4554443359375	9.75	410.87005615234375	44
as well as the spatial division of labour. This excludes any simple opposition between the	71.25	422.2054443359375	9.75	410.17889404296875	44
global and the national or the global and the local. Indeed, in some ways, the global is little	71.25	437.9554443359375	9.75	408.8260803222656	44
more than ‘a hugely extended network of localities’ (Czarniawska and Sevón 1996: 22). More	71.25	452.9554443359375	9.75	410.8412780761719	44
generally, what could be described from one vantagepoint as globalization might be re-	71.25	468.7054443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	44
described (and, perhaps, more accurately) in rather different terms from one or more	71.25	484.4554443359375	9.75	410.9151916503906	44
alternative scalar viewpoints: for example, as internationalization, triadization, regional bloc	71.25	499.4554443359375	9.75	410.001220703125	44
formation, global city network-building, cross-border region formation, international	71.25	515.2054443359375	9.75	410.895751953125	44
localization, glocalization, glurbanization, or transnationalization. For, regardless of their own	71.25	530.9554443359375	9.75	410.816650390625	44
distinctive dynamics, if any, each of these scalar processes is also linked more or less	71.25	545.9554443359375	9.75	408.8287353515625	44
closely into the overall dynamic of globalization – whether as modifying, counteracting, or	71.25	561.7054443359375	9.75	409.65045166015625	44
reinforcing processes.	71.25	577.4554443359375	9.75	97.41224670410156	44
Third, the latter dynamic is multitemporal because it involves an ever more complex	71.25	608.2054443359375	9.75	410.829345703125	45
restructuring and re-articulation of temporalities and time horizons. This aspect is captured in	71.25	623.9554443359375	9.75	410.8907470703125	45
the notions of time -space distantiation and time -space compression. The former process	71.25	639.7054443359375	9.75	409.4998779296875	45
involves the stretching of social relations over time and space so that relations can be	71.25	654.7054443359375	9.75	408.6896667480469	45
controlled or co-ordinated over longer periods of time (including the ever more distant future)	71.25	670.4554443359375	9.75	410.8882751464844	45
and longer distances, greater areas, or more scales of activity. The ultimate spatial horizon of	71.25	686.2054443359375	9.75	410.8525695800781	45
time-space distantiation is, of course, total control over social relations on a fully integrated	71.25	701.2054443359375	9.75	410.1242370605469	45
global scale into the foreseeable future. There are good reasons, however, to regard this	71.25	716.9554443359375	9.75	409.521484375	45
ultimate horizon as implausible. The latter process involves the intensification of ‘discrete’	71.25	732.7054443359375	9.75	409.4949645996094	45
I H S — Bob Jessop / Globalization: It’s about Time too! — 3	272.25	38.07427978515625	9.0	251.7540283203125	46
events in real time and/or the increased velocity of material and immaterial flows over a	113.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	409.37786865234375	47
given distance. This is also a significant (and also incompletely developed) aspect of	113.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	410.88836669921875	47
globalization and, indeed, it is time-space compression more than time-space distantiation	113.25	139.4554443359375	9.75	410.1265869140625	47
that is more distinctive of the most recent wave of globalization. If we examine the interaction	113.25	155.2054443359375	9.75	410.185791015625	47
between these two processes, it becomes evident that much of the fascination with	113.25	170.9554443359375	9.75	410.933349609375	47
globalization is rooted in the increased significance of social forces and processes that	113.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	408.7178955078125	47
combine capacities for time-space distantiation and compression: the most obvious (in the	113.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	410.35260009765625	47
sense of most cited) case is hypermobile financial capital that can circulate globally in real	113.25	217.4554443359375	9.75	410.80010986328125	47
time. But focusing on such cases ignores the significance of other forces and processes that	113.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	410.834716796875	47
are located elsewhere in the two-dimensional property space that can be derived from using	113.25	248.2054443359375	9.75	410.6304931640625	47
degrees of time-space distantiation and time-space compression as its respective horizontal	113.25	263.9554443359375	9.75	411.34893798828125	47
and vertical axes.	113.25	278.9554443359375	9.75	77.24624633789062	47
Fourth, globalization is multiform. It assumes different forms in different contexts and can be	113.25	310.4554443359375	9.75	410.63824462890625	48
realized through different strategies – neo-liberal globalization with its emphasis on the	113.25	325.4554443359375	9.75	408.8345947265625	48
integration of the world market along neo-liberal lines is only one of these general forms and	113.25	341.2054443359375	9.75	410.7945556640625	48
even this having several significant variants. Once one allows for other forms of	113.25	356.9554443359375	9.75	410.87255859375	48
technological and economic globalization and other sites and processes of globalization	113.25	371.9554443359375	9.75	408.783935546875	48
across different functional systems and the lifeworld (or civil society), then the multiformity of	113.25	387.7054443359375	9.75	410.88494873046875	48
globalization appears even more strongly.	113.25	403.4554443359375	9.75	183.69183349609375	48
Finally, globalization is clearly multicausal because it results from the complex, contingent	113.25	434.2054443359375	9.75	409.61602783203125	49
interaction of many different causal processes. For, taken together, the preceding features	113.25	449.9554443359375	9.75	409.963623046875	49
mean that, far from globalization being a unitary causal mechanism, it should be understood	113.25	464.9554443359375	9.75	410.6845703125	49
as the complex, emergent product of many different forces operating on many scales. Hence	113.25	480.7054443359375	9.75	410.8360595703125	49
nothing can be explained in terms of the causal powers of globalization – let alone causal	113.25	496.4554443359375	9.75	410.84478759765625	49
powers that are inevitable and irreversible and that are actualized on some intangible stage	113.25	511.4554443359375	9.75	410.8197021484375	49
behind our backs or on some intangible plane above our heads. Instead globalizations	113.25	527.2054443359375	9.75	410.625	49
themselves need explaining in all their manifold spatio-temporal complexity. This does not	113.25	542.9554443359375	9.75	409.7333984375	49
exclude specific hypotheses about the impact of clearly specifiable processes on particular	113.25	557.9554443359375	9.75	410.35699462890625	49
sets of social relations. Thus one might be able to investigate the extent to which the	113.25	573.7054443359375	9.75	408.7584228515625	49
increasing hypermobility of financial capital affects the capacities of national states to set real	113.25	589.4554443359375	9.75	410.87200927734375	49
interest rates to secure full employment levels of demand. But one could not meaningfully	113.25	604.4554443359375	9.75	410.08795166015625	49
investigate the wild and overgeneral claim that "globalization undermines the power of the	113.25	620.2054443359375	9.75	410.0118408203125	49
state.” This point highlights the more general point about the multicentric, multiscalar,	113.25	635.9554443359375	9.75	410.9188232421875	49
multitemporal, and multiform nature of globalization. Moreover, once we understand how	113.25	650.9554443359375	9.75	409.36053466796875	49
globalizing processes are generated and how they operate, we can better intervene in their	113.25	666.7054443359375	9.75	410.22625732421875	49
production and better resist some of their effects.	113.25	682.4554443359375	9.75	216.68978881835938	49
In spite of these arguments, it is still possible and worthwhile to reflect on the nature of	113.25	713.2054443359375	9.75	409.3944091796875	50
globalization. But we must define globalization with all due caution and in ways that allow for	113.25	728.9554443359375	9.75	410.73150634765625	50
the above-mentioned complexities. Thus I would propose here that globalization has both	113.25	744.7054443359375	9.75	409.4820556640625	50

structural and strategic moments. Structurally, it involves the objective processes whereby	71.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	409.66265869140625	52
increasing global interdependence is created among actions, organizations, and institutions	71.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	410.2220458984375	52
within (but not necessarily across) different functional systems (economy, law, politics,	71.25	139.4554443359375	9.75	410.914306640625	52
education, science, sport, etc.) and the lifeworld that lies beyond them. These processes	71.25	155.2054443359375	9.75	409.4119567871094	52
occur on various spatial scales, operate differently in each functional subsystem, involve	71.25	170.9554443359375	9.75	409.37445068359375	52
complex and tangled causal hierarchies rather than a simple, unilinear, bottom-up or top-	71.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	52
down movement, and often display an eccentric ‘nesting’ of the different scales of social	71.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	410.13629150390625	52
organization. They also develop unevenly in spacetime. Nonetheless, globalization can be	71.25	217.4554443359375	9.75	409.982177734375	52
said to increase insofar as the co-variation of actions, events, and institutional orders	71.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	410.8660583496094	52
involves more (and more important) relevant activities, is spatially more extensive, and	71.25	248.2054443359375	9.75	408.6881408691406	52
occurs more rapidly.	71.25	263.9554443359375	9.75	88.99128723144531	52
Strategically, globalization refers to conscious attempts to promote global co-ordination of	71.25	294.7054443359375	9.75	409.8079528808594	53
activities in (but not necessarily across) different functional subsystems and/or in the	71.25	310.4554443359375	9.75	410.8517761230469	53
lifeworld. This does not require that the actors involved are physically present at all points in	71.25	325.4554443359375	9.75	410.5568542480469	53
the planet but only requires them to monitor relevant activities, communicate about these,	71.25	341.2054443359375	9.75	410.0868835449219	53
and try to co-ordinate their activities with others to produce global effects. Such co-ordination	71.25	356.9554443359375	9.75	410.8564453125	53
efforts range from generalized meta-steering (constitutional or institutional design) intended	71.25	371.9554443359375	9.75	410.1438293457031	53
to produce a more or less comprehensive global order through creation of international	71.25	387.7054443359375	9.75	409.5173645019531	53
regimes to particularistic pursuit of specific economic-corporate interests within such (meta-)	71.25	403.4554443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	53
frameworks. There is clearly scope for wide variation here as shown by the neo-liberal,	71.25	418.4554443359375	9.75	410.83935546875	53
market-led globalization promoted by the World Bank, the horizontal ‘global governance’	71.25	434.2054443359375	9.75	409.437744140625	53
favoured by proponents (especially NGOs) of democratic international regimes, and plans for	71.25	449.9554443359375	9.75	410.85711669921875	53
more top-down inter-statal government. Not all actors are (or could hope to be) major global	71.25	464.9554443359375	9.75	411.3403015136719	53
players but many more have to monitor the global as a horizon of action, the implications of	71.25	480.7054443359375	9.75	410.63153076171875	53
changing scalar divisions, and the impact of time-space distantiation and compression on	71.25	496.4554443359375	9.75	409.5599670410156	53
their identities, interests, and strategies. The overall course of globalization will be the largely	71.25	511.4554443359375	9.75	410.9117126464844	53
unintended, relatively chaotic outcome of interaction among various strategies to shape or	71.25	527.2054443359375	9.75	409.9691467285156	53
resist globalization in a complex, path-dependent world society. It follows that any account of	71.25	542.9554443359375	9.75	410.75927734375	53
globalization is likely to be partial and incomplete, exaggerating some features, missing	71.25	557.9554443359375	9.75	410.91455078125	53
others, and risking neglect of events and processes on other scales.	71.25	573.7054443359375	9.75	300.6873779296875	53
Globalization is part of a proliferation of scales and temporalities as narrated, institutionalized	71.25	604.4554443359375	9.75	410.9187927246094	54
objects of action, regularization, and governance. The number of scales and temporalities of	71.25	620.2054443359375	9.75	410.6241760253906	54
action that can be distinguished is immense but far fewer ever get explicitly institutionalized.	71.25	635.9554443359375	9.75	410.7606506347656	54
How far this happens depends on the prevailing technologies of power – material, social,	71.25	650.9554443359375	9.75	409.89202880859375	54
and spatio-temporal – that enable the identification and institutionalization of specific scales	71.25	666.7054443359375	9.75	410.3370056152344	54
of action and temporalities. It is the development of new logistical means (of distantiation,	71.25	682.4554443359375	9.75	410.04962158203125	54
compression, communication), organizational technologies, institutions with new spatio-	71.25	697.4554443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	54
temporal horizons of action, broader institutional architectures, new global standards	71.25	713.2054443359375	9.75	410.8514404296875	54
(including world time), and modes of governance that helps to explain this growing	71.25	728.9554443359375	9.75	410.8925476074219	54
proliferation of economically and politically significant institutionalized scales and	71.25	743.9554443359375	9.75	410.8983459472656	54

temporalities. Moreover, as new scales and temporalities emerge and/or existing ones gain	113.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	410.16357421875	56
in institutional thickness, social forces also tend to develop new mechanisms to link or co-	113.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	56
ordinate them. This in turn often prompts efforts to co-ordinate these new co-ordination	113.25	139.4554443359375	9.75	410.8564453125	56
mechanisms. Thus, as the triad regions begin to acquire institutional form and identity, new	113.25	155.2054443359375	9.75	410.18121337890625	56
forums develop to co-ordinate their bilateral relations. Likewise, as regionalism develops in	113.25	170.9554443359375	9.75	410.07843017578125	56
the European Union, we find not only an EU-wide Committee of the Regions but also a	113.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	409.3240966796875	56
proliferation of other peak associations and multilateral linkages among regions. Even further	113.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	410.83111572265625	56
down the scale, local authorities develop associations to promote their interests at national,	113.25	217.4554443359375	9.75	410.23089599609375	56
regional, international, and global levels. All of this produces increasing scalar complexity,	113.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	410.9405517578125	56
increasing scope for deliberate interscalar articulation, and increasing problems in making	113.25	248.2054443359375	9.75	409.557373046875	56
such interscalar articulation work. Similar issues occur in relation to time and its governance.	113.25	263.9554443359375	9.75	410.84368896484375	56
This can be seen in the rise of nano -temporalities at the micro-level and long -term action to	113.25	278.9554443359375	9.75	410.7825927734375	56
ensure environmental sustainability at the macro-level. And this leads in turn to growing	113.25	294.7054443359375	9.75	409.04925537109375	56
problems of intertemporal governance.	113.25	310.4554443359375	9.75	170.17803955078125	56
2. Globalization and the Spatial Turn	113.25	354.25494384765625	15.75	273.7442932128906	57
Commentators often portray globalization as one of the driving forces in the ‘spatial turn’ in	113.25	391.4554443359375	9.75	409.62164306640625	58
the social sciences and/or as one of its most important products. For, insofar as globalization	113.25	406.4554443359375	9.75	410.780517578125	58
appears to be an essentially spatial phenomenon, it allegedly demands an approach that is	113.25	422.2054443359375	9.75	410.229736328125	58
sensitive to issues of space, place, and scale. Moreover, when we approach globalization in	113.25	437.9554443359375	9.75	410.59918212890625	58
such terms, this often changes how other issues are seen. The spatial turn can be thematic,	113.25	452.9554443359375	9.75	410.7427978515625	58
methodological, or both (cf. Jessop 2001). In the first sense it involves thematizing	113.25	468.7054443359375	9.75	410.9444580078125	58
intrinsically spatial issues as objects of analysis. This sort of turn is hardly controversial	113.25	484.4554443359375	9.75	409.62408447265625	58
provided that it does not lead to a fetishistic naturalization of space, place, and scale or to	113.25	499.4554443359375	9.75	410.03778076171875	58
the belief that space, place, and scale have their own autonomous properties regardless of	113.25	515.2054443359375	9.75	410.47247314453125	58
their social constitution and reproduction and regardless of their articulation with other	113.25	530.9554443359375	9.75	410.93182373046875	58
moments of social relations. In the second sense, the spatial turn involves an investigation of	113.25	545.9554443359375	9.75	410.86419677734375	58
more complex issues by using their spatial moments as an entry point, without this requiring	113.25	561.7054443359375	9.75	410.6182861328125	58
that the investigation does not proceed beyond the spatial. In either case, the spatial turn	113.25	577.4554443359375	9.75	410.00341796875	58
could involve little more than an innocent, belated, and welcome recognition that space	113.25	592.4554443359375	9.75	408.839111328125	58
matters in one or more ways; but it could also involve the belief that an earlier interest in time	113.25	608.2054443359375	9.75	410.2412109375	58
and temporal issues was mistaken, overdone, or at best misleading. In short, there is a risk	113.25	623.9554443359375	9.75	409.55096435546875	58
that the spatial turn is seen as a simple alternative to a focus on temporality. What is really	113.25	638.9554443359375	9.75	410.20452880859375	58
required is a discussion of spatio-temporality rather than implying that there is a choice	113.25	654.7054443359375	9.75	408.250732421875	58
between them.	113.25	670.4554443359375	9.75	65.16593933105469	58
The ability to integrate the spatial and temporal aspects of globalization is evident in Marx’s	113.25	701.2054443359375	9.75	410.2491455078125	59
critique of political economy and his analysis of capitalism in terms of an economy of time.	113.25	716.9554443359375	9.75	410.1488037109375	59
The key point here is that the spatial dynamic of capitalism can be derived in the first	113.25	731.9554443359375	9.75	408.79803466796875	59

instance from the competition among capitalists to reduce socially necessary labour time as	71.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	410.739501953125	61
well as the total time involved in production. Marx showed that individual capitals are subject	71.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	410.871826171875	61
to competitive pressure to reduce production, circulation, and turnover times. They also face	71.25	139.4554443359375	9.75	410.6727600097656	61
pressure to innovate in other ways that may affect the spatial and scalar divisions of labour.	71.25	155.2054443359375	9.75	410.7550964355469	61
In this sense, although place and space are certainly regarded as a basic material	71.25	170.9554443359375	9.75	410.27117919921875	61
presupposition of all social activities, their entry into Marx’s analysis as major variables come	71.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	410.8209228515625	61
much later in the course of his analysis. They are first seriously introduced in terms of	71.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	409.0020446777344	61
particular capitals rather than capital in general; in terms of turnover time rather than	71.25	217.4554443359375	9.75	410.92791748046875	61
production time; and in the context of use-value (e.g., transportation) rather than that of	71.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	409.46856689453125	61
value or exchange-value (de la Haye 1988). This spatial reorganization was as prone to	71.25	248.2054443359375	9.75	409.69244384765625	61
contradictions, however, as any feature of capital as a social relation. For our purposes, this	71.25	263.9554443359375	9.75	410.6873779296875	61
implies, of course, that globalization is also contradictory and will have its limits.	71.25	278.9554443359375	9.75	351.6683044433594	61
These points about Marx’s analysis of time and space are worth making because contrasting	71.25	310.4554443359375	9.75	410.8680114746094	62
views have been expressed about their relative primacy in capitalism. It has been suggested	71.25	325.4554443359375	9.75	410.8374328613281	62
that capital’s concern with the production of value leads to an emphasis on increasing the	71.25	341.2054443359375	9.75	410.0791320800781	62
socially necessary labour time embodied in commodities (the time of labour); that its concern	71.25	356.9554443359375	9.75	410.8896789550781	62
with the production of surplus value leads to an emphasis on control over space and the	71.25	371.9554443359375	9.75	409.5602722167969	62
importance of constructing and reconstructing space relations and the global space	71.25	387.7054443359375	9.75	410.93084716796875	62
economy; that its concern with profits leads to an emphasis on reducing the socially	71.25	403.4554443359375	9.75	408.21343994140625	62
necessary turnover time of circulating capital and that this is often associated with command	71.25	418.4554443359375	9.75	410.7446594238281	62
over space (means of communication and transportation) as well as organizational	71.25	434.2054443359375	9.75	410.9309997558594	62
innovations; that its concern with social use-value is associated with an emphasis on the	71.25	449.9554443359375	9.75	409.5178527832031	62
spatial relations that determine the usefulness of particular goods and services and/or on the	71.25	464.9554443359375	9.75	410.8511047363281	62
time and/or timing of the delivery of goods and services; and, finally, those who take class	71.25	480.7054443359375	9.75	410.7921142578125	62
struggle as their entry point (especially the struggles of subordinate classes) tend to focus on	71.25	496.4554443359375	9.75	410.86566162109375	62
place and space. For, as Soja comments, class struggle ‘must encompass and focus upon	71.25	511.4554443359375	9.75	410.15081787109375	62
the vulnerable point: the production of space, the territorial structure of exploitation and	71.25	527.2054443359375	9.75	409.7525939941406	62
domination, the spatially controlled reproduction of the system as a whole’ (Soja 1989: 92).	71.25	542.9554443359375	9.75	398.95562744140625	62
Such contrasting opinions are not so much signs of intellectual incoherence as expressions	71.25	573.7054443359375	9.75	410.2344970703125	63
of basic contradictions in capitalism itself. This is reflected in the contrast between the	71.25	589.4554443359375	9.75	408.9712219238281	63
mobility of abstract money capital in a space of flows and the commodified production and	71.25	604.4554443359375	9.75	410.1034240722656	63
consumption of specific use-values in specific times and places. Yet even this contrast is	71.25	620.2054443359375	9.75	409.57415771484375	63
only ever tendential and relative, for ‘in every instance when we accentuate space or time,	71.25	635.9554443359375	9.75	410.0633544921875	63
the other aspect is still present, although hidden’ (Czarniawska and Sevón 1996: 21). Thus	71.25	650.9554443359375	9.75	410.123291015625	63
the mobility of abstract money capital in a space of flows depends on the development of the	71.25	666.7054443359375	9.75	410.83319091796875	63
sort of fixed technical and social infrastructures that characterize the emerging network of	71.25	682.4554443359375	9.75	409.5779724121094	63
global cities. And the production and consumption of specific use-values involves a spatial	71.25	697.4554443359375	9.75	410.720703125	63
and scalar division of labour which must also be co-ordinated across different time scales	71.25	713.2054443359375	9.75	410.2416076660156	63
(e.g., associated with different production cycles, different ratios of fixed to circulating capital,	71.25	728.9554443359375	9.75	410.80999755859375	63
and different degrees of durability of goods and services destined for private consumption).	71.25	743.9554443359375	9.75	410.223388671875	63

There are also ‘contradictory movements in which time is simultaneously compressed and	113.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	410.322998046875	65
expanded, depending on which part of the system one examines, so that the general	113.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	408.85888671875	65
progression is uneven and punctuated by more or less significant reverses’ (Schoenberger	113.25	139.4554443359375	9.75	410.0853271484375	65
1997: 19). This suggests the need to make a thematic and metho dological temporal (re)turn	113.25	155.2054443359375	9.75	410.86981201171875	65
to redress one-sided concern with space in studies of globalization. Interestingly, just such a	113.25	170.9554443359375	9.75	410.81195068359375	65
temporal (re)turn can be seen in a growing recognition of the need to bring time (back) into	113.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	410.24169921875	65
the analysis of globalization among those who had previously privileged the spatial.	113.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	367.4166259765625	65

Contradictions of Capitalism	113.25	265.00494384765625	15.75	216.67025756835938	66
Here I want to argue that the reproduction and regularization of capital as a social relation	113.25	301.4554443359375	9.75	410.2081298828125	67
involves a social fix (complex mode of regularization) that compensates for the inherent	113.25	317.2054443359375	9.75	409.05401611328125	67
incompleteness of the pure capital relation, i.e., its inability to secure the conditions for the	113.25	332.9554443359375	9.75	410.107666015625	67
continued expansion of capital accumulation purely in and through the operation of profit-	113.25	347.9554443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	67
oriented, market-mediated economic forces. This social fix is always time-and-place specific	113.25	363.7054443359375	9.75	410.8505859375	67
and gives a specific dynamic to capital accumulation through its distinctive, historically	113.25	379.4554443359375	9.75	408.6707763671875	67
variable, and inherently unstable articulation of economic and extra-economic elements. The	113.25	394.4554443359375	9.75	411.09967041015625	67
importance of these extra-economic elements is widely recognized, of course, in very	113.25	410.2054443359375	9.75	410.896484375	67
different social scientific literatures (Smithian, Marxian, Weberian, Durkheimian, liberal and	113.25	425.9554443359375	9.75	410.0595703125	67
neo-liberal, institutionalist, etc). But there is also widespread disagreement about its	113.25	440.9554443359375	9.75	410.75	67
implications. On my reading, this social fix helps to secure a relatively durable structural	113.25	456.7054443359375	9.75	410.08343505859375	67
coherence in managing the contradictions and dilemmas inherent in the capital relation so	113.25	472.4554443359375	9.75	410.05859375	67
that different forms, institutions, and practices tend to be mutually reinforcing. This includes	113.25	487.4554443359375	9.75	410.1729736328125	67
the imposition on these economic and extra-economic elements of a distinctive spatio-	113.25	503.2054443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	67
temporal fix.	113.25	518.9554443359375	9.75	53.71049499511719	67
Structurally, these spatio-temporal fixes emerge when an accumulation regime and its	113.25	549.7054443359375	9.75	410.90472412109375	68
complex mode of regularization co-evolve to produce a certain structural coherence within a	113.25	565.4554443359375	9.75	410.763427734375	68
given spatio-temporal framework but not beyond it. This is typically associated with a	113.25	580.4554443359375	9.75	408.3460693359375	68
distinctive hierarchy of the various structural or institutional forms of capitalism that thereby	113.25	596.2054443359375	9.75	410.11541748046875	68
affects their interactions within the institutional architecture as a whole and shapes the	113.25	611.9554443359375	9.75	408.6015625	68
overall logic of the spatio-temporal fix. This hierarchy involves giving greater priority to the	113.25	626.9554443359375	9.75	409.98828125	68
regularizing of some structural forms (and giving greater priority, perhaps, to one or other	113.25	642.7054443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	68
aspect of their associated contradictions and dilemmas) than to other structural forms. These	113.25	658.4554443359375	9.75	410.90997314453125	68
priorities will vary with accumulation regimes, modes of growth, and governance capacities.	113.25	673.4554443359375	9.75	410.12664794921875	68

forms have become more important and, indeed, critical to the eventual consolidation of a	71.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	410.1075134277344	70
new accumulation regime and mode of regularization. These are the forms of competition	71.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	409.54962158203125	70
and the institutional forms and functions of the state. Or, again, while liberal market	71.25	139.4554443359375	9.75	410.87451171875	70
economies may give more weight to labour-power as a substitutable factor of production and	71.25	155.2054443359375	9.75	410.8924865722656	70
to the wage as a cost of production, more co-ordinated capitalist economies may prioritize	71.25	170.9554443359375	9.75	409.677734375	70
labour-power in its guise as human capital (sic) and the wage as a source of demand.	71.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	408.8997497558594	70

temporal contexts.	71.25	248.2054443359375	9.75	81.64460754394531	70
Such spatio-temporal fixes delimit the main spatial and temporal boundaries within which	71.25	278.9554443359375	9.75	409.3398742675781	71
structural coherence is secured, and externalize certain costs of securing this coherence	71.25	294.7054443359375	9.75	409.8252258300781	71
beyond these boundaries. Even within these boundaries some classes, class fractions,	71.25	310.4554443359375	9.75	408.62469482421875	71
social categories or other social forces located inside these spatio-temporal boundaries are	71.25	325.4554443359375	9.75	410.16748046875	71
marginalized, excluded, or oppressed. Thus, spatio-temporal fixes also facilitate the	71.25	341.2054443359375	9.75	410.9421081542969	71
institutionalized compromises on which accumulation regimes and modes of regulation	71.25	356.9554443359375	9.75	410.8999328613281	71
depend, and subsequently come to embody them. This can involve super-exploitation of	71.25	371.9554443359375	9.75	409.79962158203125	71
internal or external spaces outside the compromise, super-exploitation of nature or inherited	71.25	387.7054443359375	9.75	410.7236328125	71
social resources, deferral of problems into an indefinite future and, of course, the exploitation	71.25	403.4554443359375	9.75	410.6871337890625	71
and/or oppression of specific classes, strata or other social categories.	71.25	418.4554443359375	9.75	311.1675720214844	71
Nonetheless, insofar as such compromises marginalize forces that act as bearers of	71.25	449.9554443359375	9.75	410.96478271484375	72
functions or operations essential to long-run accumulation, the growth of significant	71.25	464.9554443359375	9.75	410.9337463378906	72
imbalances, disproportionalities or disunity in the circuit of capital will tend to strengthen the	71.25	480.7054443359375	9.75	410.7497253417969	72
hand of these forces, enabling them to disrupt the institutionalized compromises involved in	71.25	496.4554443359375	9.75	410.2801208496094	72
a particular accumulation regime, mode of regulation, state form and spatio-temporal fix (cf.	71.25	511.4554443359375	9.75	410.1806640625	72
Clarke 1977). Such crises typically act as a steering mechanism for the always provisional,	71.25	527.2054443359375	9.75	410.1689758300781	72
partial and unstable re-equilibration of capital accumulation insofar as they prompt attempts	71.25	542.9554443359375	9.75	410.2466125488281	72
to guide the forcible reimposition of the unity of the circuit of capital through new	71.25	557.9554443359375	9.75	410.89642333984375	72
accumulation strategies and modes of regulation.	71.25	573.7054443359375	9.75	216.68194580078125	72
The primary scales and temporal horizons around which such fixes are built and the extent	71.25	605.2054443359375	9.75	410.2469787597656	73
of their coherence vary considerably over time. This is reflected in the variable coincidence	71.25	620.2054443359375	9.75	410.08538818359375	73
of different boundaries, borders or frontiers of action and the changing primacy of different	71.25	635.9554443359375	9.75	409.9999084472656	73
scales. Political boundaries, for example, have been characterized by medieval polymorphy,	71.25	651.7054443359375	9.75	410.7036437988281	73
Westphalian exclusivity, and post-Westphalian complexity. Likewise, the consolidation of	71.25	666.7054443359375	9.75	408.8901062011719	73
capitalism witnessed the national eclipse of the urban scale as cities were integrated into	71.25	682.4554443359375	9.75	409.5361328125	73
national economic systems and subordinated to the political power of national territorial	71.25	698.2054443359375	9.75	409.4652099609375	73
states. And the national scale has since been challenged by the rise of global city networks	71.25	713.2054443359375	9.75	410.2889404296875	73
more oriented to other global cities than to national hinterlands.	71.25	728.9554443359375	9.75	278.8626403808594	73

These ideas have important implications for accumulation strategies, state projects, and	113.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	408.200439453125	75
hegemonic projects on various scales of action and over different time horizons. For each of	113.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	410.70135498046875	75
these involves an attempt to strategically co-ordinate activities across different systems and	113.25	139.4554443359375	9.75	410.12689208984375	75
the lifeworld in order to achieve a limited, localized structural coherence in accumulation,	113.25	155.2054443359375	9.75	409.46502685546875	75
state activities and social formations respectively. There is ample scope for competition	113.25	170.9554443359375	9.75	408.7855224609375	75
among social forces over accumulation strategies, state projects, and hegemonic visions as	113.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	410.189208984375	75
well as for potential disjunctions between the strategies that emerge from such competition	113.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	410.1590576171875	75
to dominate their respective imagined spheres. In this context a key role is played by the	113.25	217.4554443359375	9.75	408.84423828125	75
rivalries and struggles of intellectual forces, individually and collectively, in a free-floating or	113.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	410.50994873046875	75
an organized manner, to articulate strategies, projects and visions that seek to reconcile	113.25	248.2054443359375	9.75	409.33349609375	75
contradictions and conflicts and to resolve dilemmas for various sites and scales of action	113.25	263.9554443359375	9.75	410.0120849609375	75
(cf. Gramsci 1971). The principal forces involved in these rivalries and struggles are	113.25	278.9554443359375	9.75	410.8785400390625	75
organized interests, political parties, and social movements with the mass media rather than	113.25	294.7054443359375	9.75	410.760009765625	75
the public sphere now having a central position in the mediation of the struggle for	113.25	310.4554443359375	9.75	410.868408203125	75
hegemony in these matters.	113.25	325.4554443359375	9.75	122.93739318847656	75
As part of a given spatio-temporal fix, different institutions, apparatuses or agencies may	113.25	356.9554443359375	9.75	409.568359375	76
specialize primarily in one or other horn of a dilemma, deal with it over different temporal	113.25	371.9554443359375	9.75	410.25091552734375	76
horizons, or address different aspects at different times. The state may also alter the balance	113.25	387.7054443359375	9.75	410.83984375	76
between institutions, apparatuses and agencies by reallocating responsibilities and	113.25	403.4554443359375	9.75	410.8929443359375	76
resources, allowing them to compete for political support and legitimacy as circumstances	113.25	418.4554443359375	9.75	408.81890869140625	76
change, etc. Such strategies may be pursued entirely within the state or extend to the	113.25	434.2054443359375	9.75	408.8896484375	76
division between state and non -state modes of governance. Another way to manage	113.25	449.9554443359375	9.75	410.8538818359375	76
potential problems arising from the limits of different modes of policy-making or crisis-	113.25	464.9554443359375	9.75	411.24676513671875	76
management is through variable policy emphases across different scales of action and	113.25	480.7054443359375	9.75	408.7313232421875	76
temporal horizons. For example, in Atlantic Fordism, the national state set the	113.25	496.4554443359375	9.75	410.90142822265625	76
macroeconomic framework, the local state acted as its relay for many nationally -determined	113.25	511.4554443359375	9.75	410.85150146484375	76
policies, and intergovernmental cooperation in various international regimes maintained the	113.25	527.2054443359375	9.75	410.05706787109375	76
conditions for national economic growth. Likewise, in contemporary neoliberal accumulation	113.25	542.9554443359375	9.75	410.2374267578125	76
regimes, a relative neglect of substantive (as opposed to formal) supply-side conditions at	113.25	557.9554443359375	9.75	410.1195068359375	76
the international and national levels in favour of capital flows in and through space is partly	113.25	573.7054443359375	9.75	410.18212890625	76
compensated by more interventionist policies at the regional, urban and local levels, where	113.25	589.4554443359375	9.75	410.2073974609375	76
many material interdependencies among specific productive capitals are located (Gough and	113.25	604.4554443359375	9.75	410.6710205078125	76
Eisenschitz 1996). This helps explain why local states are being reorganized as new forms of	113.25	620.2054443359375	9.75	410.88690185546875	76
local or regional partnership emerge to guide and promote the development of local or	113.25	635.9554443359375	9.75	408.80511474609375	76
regional resources.	113.25	650.9554443359375	9.75	84.66426086425781	76
Another example of spatial-scalar divisions of labour is the distinction between foreign and	113.25	682.4554443359375	9.75	410.0592041015625	77
domestic relations inherent in the modern state system such that some parts of the state	113.25	697.4554443359375	9.75	408.824462890625	77
apparatus specialize in external relations, some in internal relations. However, with the	113.25	713.2054443359375	9.75	408.697265625	77
growing impact of globalization and new forms of competitiveness, inherited divisions of	113.25	728.9554443359375	9.75	408.98162841796875	77
state labour change. Thus, not only is the distinction between domestic and foreign policy	113.25	743.9554443359375	9.75	409.9600830078125	77

becoming blurred; but subnational governments are now getting engaged in foreign	71.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	410.86181640625	79
(economic) policy through cross-border cooperation, international localization, and so on, at	71.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	410.2646484375	79
the same time as supranational bodies get involved in the redesign and reorientation of	71.25	139.4554443359375	9.75	409.3065185546875	79
subnational politics.	71.25	155.2054443359375	9.75	87.63090515136719	79
There can also be a temporal division of labour with different institutions, apparatuses or	71.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	410.1423645019531	80
agencies responding to contradictions, dilemmas and paradoxes over different time	71.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	410.88238525390625	80
horizons. This is reflected in the conventional distinction between planning and execution	71.25	217.4554443359375	9.75	409.41888427734375	80
within organizations and in the primacy of different temporal horizons across organizations	71.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	410.4871826171875	80
(for example, banks and central banks, computer-programmed arbitrage funds and long-term	71.25	248.2054443359375	9.75	410.8125	80
venture capital funds). Similarly, corporatist arrangements have often been established to	71.25	263.9554443359375	9.75	409.5979309082031	80
address long-term economic and social issues where complex, reciprocal interdependence	71.25	278.9554443359375	9.75	410.3407287597656	80
requires long-term cooperation – thereby taking the relevant policy areas outside the short-	71.25	294.7054443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	80
term time horizons of electoral cycles and parliamentary in-fighting. In both cases there is	71.25	310.4554443359375	9.75	410.19635009765625	80
scope for activities to rebalance relations among these institutions, apparatuses or agencies	71.25	325.4554443359375	9.75	410.75445556640625	80
through differential allocation of resources; allowing them to compete for legitimacy in	71.25	341.2054443359375	9.75	410.93402099609375	80

with globalization enhance capital’s capacity to defer and displace its internal contradictions,	71.25	472.4554443359375	9.75	410.8157653808594	82

labour, by creating more opportunities for moving up, down, and across scales, by	71.25	533.9554443359375	9.75	410.91241455078125	82

trust building, and by re-articulating different time horizons. These enhanced capacities can	71.25	580.4554443359375	9.75	409.7877502441406	82
markedly reinforce tendencies to uneven development as the search continues for new	71.25	596.2054443359375	9.75	408.7156677246094	82
spatio-temporal displacements and new spatio-temporal fixes. Above all, globalization helps	71.25	611.9554443359375	9.75	410.40472412109375	82
to emancipate the exchange-value moment of capital from extra-economic and spatio-	71.25	626.9554443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	82
temporal constraints, increases the emphasis on speed, acceleration, and turnover time, and	71.25	642.7054443359375	9.75	410.8450927734375	82
enhances capital’s capacity to escape the control of other systems insofar as these are still	71.25	658.4554443359375	9.75	410.2353210449219	82
territorially differentiated and fragmented. 1 This is linked to its increased capacity for	71.25	670.6806640625	12.5247802734375	410.9572448730469	82
discounting events (so collapsing the future into the present), its increased capacity for time-	71.25	689.2054443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	82

space compression, its resort to complex derivative trading to manage risk, and its capacities	113.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	410.91790771484375	85
to jump scale. Finally, globalization weakens the capacity of national states to guide capital’s	113.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	410.8359375	85
expansion within a framework of national security (as reflected in the ‘national security	113.25	139.4554443359375	9.75	408.74932861328125	85

national project with a corresponding spatio-temporal fix. And, conversely, it increases the	113.25	170.9554443359375	9.75	409.104248046875	85
pressures on national states to adjust to the time horizons and temporalities of mobile capital	113.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	411.56243896484375	85
able to operate beyond their frontiers.	113.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	165.70443725585938	85
In short, the development of a globalizing capitalism typically intensifies the spatio-temporal	113.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	410.7720947265625	86

of social life is particularly disruptive and disorienting (see Virilio 1994; 1998). Here I want to	113.25	294.7054443359375	9.75	410.7152099609375	86
note five tensions or contradictions it introduces into the globalizing economy. These are not	113.25	310.4554443359375	9.75	410.67572021484375	86
engendered by globalization as such; my approach to globalization rules this out. But they	113.25	325.4554443359375	9.75	410.031494140625	86
are tensions or contradictions that become more severe with the increasing organizational	113.25	341.2054443359375	9.75	410.68487548828125	86
and spatio-temporal complexity and flexibility in the circuits of capital associated with	113.25	356.9554443359375	9.75	410.8760986328125	86
globalization.	113.25	371.9554443359375	9.75	56.99330139160156	86
First, there is a tension between the complex, reciprocally interdependent substantive	113.25	403.4554443359375	9.75	410.8851318359375	87
reproduction requirements of real natural, social, and cultural processes and the simplified,	113.25	418.4554443359375	9.75	410.14727783203125	87
one-sided, monetized temporalities involved in capital’s emphasis on exchange-value.	113.25	434.2054443359375	9.75	410.96051025390625	87
Globalization reinforces this tension by making it easier for capital to destroy the local	113.25	449.9554443359375	9.75	409.29119873046875	87
bounties of first and second nature and then move on without regard to their long-term	113.25	464.9554443359375	9.75	410.8125	87
reproduction. Indeed, the growing emphasis on artificial short -term profit means that, ‘as	113.25	480.7054443359375	9.75	409.3643798828125	87
capital speeds up, it diminishes or degrades the conditions of the natural reproduction of	113.25	496.4554443359375	9.75	409.37677001953125	87
natural things’ (Brennan 1995: 31).	113.25	511.4554443359375	9.75	152.94378662109375	87
Second, there is a tension among the many and varied substantive temporalities of human	113.25	542.9554443359375	9.75	410.146240234375	88
existence (biological, sentient, sociocultural, self-reflexive) and the abstract time inherent in	113.25	558.7054443359375	9.75	410.247802734375	88
the commodification of labour power and the dominance of formal market rationality (Stahel	113.25	573.7054443359375	9.75	410.88177490234375	88
1999: 108; see also Polanyi 1944). This is reflected in the stresses of everyday life and in a	113.25	589.4554443359375	9.75	410.69451904296875	88
growing sense of time-space compression.	113.25	605.2054443359375	9.75	188.86611938476562	88
Third, contemporary capitalism involves a paradox that ‘(t)he most advanced economies	113.25	635.9554443359375	9.75	408.890380859375	89
function more and more in terms of the extra-economic’ (Veltz 1996: 12). This rests on the	113.25	651.7054443359375	9.75	410.26593017578125	89
increasing interdependence between economic and extra-economic factors making for	113.25	666.7054443359375	9.75	410.89691162109375	89
structural competitiveness. This is linked to the growth of new technologies based on more	113.25	682.4554443359375	9.75	410.121826171875	89
complex transnational, national, and regional systems of innovation, to the paradigm shift	113.25	698.2054443359375	9.75	409.59130859375	89
from Fordism with its emphasis on productivity growth rooted in economies of scale to post-	113.25	713.2054443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	89
Fordism with its emphasis on mobilising social as well as economic sources of flexibility and	113.25	728.9554443359375	9.75	410.6959228515625	89
entrepreneurialism, and to the more general attempts to penetrate micro-social relations in	113.25	744.7054443359375	9.75	410.13897705078125	89

the interests of valorization. It is reflected in the emphasis now given to social capital, trust,	71.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	409.5400085449219	91
and communities of learning as well as to the competitive role of entrepreneurial cities,	71.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	411.042724609375	91
enterprise culture, and enterprising subjects. This paradox generates a major contradiction	71.25	139.4554443359375	9.75	410.1905822753906	91
between short-term economic calculation (especially in financial flows) and the long-term	71.25	155.2054443359375	9.75	410.8125	91
dynamic of ‘real competition’ rooted in resources (skills, trust, heightened reflexivity,	71.25	170.9554443359375	9.75	410.880859375	91
collective mastery of techniques, economies of agglomeration and size) that may take years	71.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	410.8074951171875	91
to create, stabilize, and reproduce. Likewise, spatially, there is a basic contradiction between	71.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	410.899658203125	91
the economy seen as a de-territorialized, socially disembedded space of flows and as a	71.25	217.4554443359375	9.75	409.4256286621094	91
territorially rooted, socially embedded system of extra-economic as well as economic	71.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	410.90814208984375	91
resources, competencies, and activities (Storper 1997). The latter moment is reflected in	71.25	248.2054443359375	9.75	409.3230285644531	91
wide range of new concepts to describe the knowledge-driven economy – national, regional,	71.25	263.9554443359375	9.75	410.415771484375	91
and local systems of innovation, innovative milieus, systemic or structural competitiveness,	71.25	278.9554443359375	9.75	410.19500732421875	91
learning regions, social capital, trust, learning-by-doing, speed-based competition, etc. This	71.25	294.7054443359375	9.75	410.3187255859375	91
poses new dilemmas for the stabilization of the capital relation over more scales and over	71.25	310.4554443359375	9.75	410.0582275390625	91
increasingly compressed as well as extended temporal horizons of action.	71.25	325.4554443359375	9.75	326.16424560546875	91
Fourth, temporally, there is a tension between the drive to accelerate the circulation of capital	71.25	356.9554443359375	9.75	411.6253356933594	92
by shortening the production cycle between design and final consumption and the long-term	71.25	371.9554443359375	9.75	410.8125	92
infrastructural development on which this depends. In this context, Harvey notes that ‘[I]t	71.25	387.7054443359375	9.75	409.4457702636719	92
takes a specific organization of space to try and annihilate space and it takes capital of long	71.25	403.4554443359375	9.75	410.8014831542969	92
turnover time to facilitate the more rapid turnover of the rest. But the reduction of spatial	71.25	418.4554443359375	9.75	410.1288757324219	92
barriers has an equally powerful opposite effect; small-scale and finely graded differences	71.25	434.2054443359375	9.75	409.7369689941406	92
between the qualities of places (their labor supply, their infrastructures, and political	71.25	449.9554443359375	9.75	410.8882141113281	92
receptivity, their resource mixes, their market niches, etc.) become even more important	71.25	464.9554443359375	9.75	408.88427734375	92
because multinational capital is better able to exploit them. (1996a: 246–7). This set of	71.25	480.7054443359375	9.75	409.1195068359375	92
contradictions is aggravated by the increasing capacity for temporal compression linked to	71.25	496.4554443359375	9.75	410.210693359375	92
the latest ICT developments, which distresses many other fractions of capital and puts	71.25	511.4554443359375	9.75	408.6997375488281	92
pressure on the state and other less mobile social forces.	71.25	527.2054443359375	9.75	252.67730712890625	92
Fifth, spatially, there is a tension between extending the scope of markets through the	71.25	557.9554443359375	9.75	409.3409423828125	93
annihilation of space by time and the need for fixed infrastructure to enable rapid movement	71.25	573.7054443359375	9.75	410.763916015625	93
through space (which must be destroyed in turn as the next round of accumulation develops)	71.25	589.4554443359375	9.75	410.7371826171875	93
(Harvey 1996b: 6). This contradiction may be aggravated by the expansion of production	71.25	604.4554443359375	9.75	409.5123596191406	93
through mechanization and scale economies. Because this requires larger markets, it	71.25	620.2054443359375	9.75	410.85687255859375	93
extends the time of commodity circulation and may also extend the overall turnover time due	71.25	635.9554443359375	9.75	410.79681396484375	93
to the higher proportion of fixed to total capital. It can also lead to a dialectic of spatial	71.25	650.9554443359375	9.75	410.09185791015625	93
concentration (agglomeration economies) and dispersal (congestion, land prices,	71.25	666.7054443359375	9.75	410.8969421386719	93
unionization, etc.) (Schoenberger 1997: 19–21).	71.25	682.4554443359375	9.75	211.38735961914062	93
There are spiral processes at work in the last two contradictions that tend to increase the	71.25	713.2054443359375	9.75	410.2761535644531	94
spatio-temporal complexities of regularizing and governing capital accumulation. ‘Every local	71.25	728.9554443359375	9.75	411.478271484375	94
decentralization presupposes a renewed form of centralization at a higher level. Every	71.25	744.7054443359375	9.75	410.9368591308594	94

temporal flexibilization requires, with increasing complexity, new mechanisms in order to hold	113.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	410.9415283203125	96
the seemingly loosening temporal connections together. Flexibility becomes possible against	113.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	410.82171630859375	96
the background of a previously unattained degree of constant temporal availability, as the	113.25	139.4554443359375	9.75	408.86236572265625	96
prerequisite and consequence of which it functions’ (Nowotny 1994: 99). There are also	113.25	155.2054443359375	9.75	408.991943359375	96
oscillations in the relative importance of time and space. Thus, whereas mass production	113.25	170.9554443359375	9.75	409.480712890625	96
compressed time in production, it extended it in product life cycles to valorize dedicated fixed	113.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	410.86346435546875	96
capital and allow for the unmanageability of time required for product development. Now the	113.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	410.7327880859375	96
situation is reversed. The current emphasis is on speeding up product development times	113.25	217.4554443359375	9.75	409.9427490234375	96
and order-to-delivery cycle. This also involves maximum flexibility in organization of	113.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	410.87554931640625	96
production, economies of scope, etc. (Schoenberger 1997: 45).	113.25	248.2054443359375	9.75	278.9045715332031	96
5. The Implications of Globalization for	113.25	292.75494384765625	15.75	293.7918701171875	97
(National) States	113.25	311.50494384765625	15.75	125.19599914550781	97
Much has been written on the implications of globalization for the possible demise of the	113.25	347.9554443359375	9.75	409.38836669921875	98
national state and/or the national state’s importance for continuing globalization. Such	113.25	363.7054443359375	9.75	410.87701416015625	98
commentaries have been plagued by false oppositions and assumptions. The first false	113.25	379.4554443359375	9.75	408.67633056640625	98
opposition is posited most starkly as that between the state as a ‘power container’ that	113.25	394.4554443359375	9.75	408.87994384765625	98
operates exclusively within defined territorial frontiers and the economy as a borderless	113.25	410.2054443359375	9.75	408.9246826171875	98
exchange mechanism with no important territorial anchoring. This opposition commits four	113.25	425.9554443359375	9.75	409.562744140625	98
errors in its conception of the state and economy. First, states (and the social forces they	113.25	440.9554443359375	9.75	410.05792236328125	98
represent) are actively involved in constituting and reconstituting the spatio-temporal	113.25	456.7054443359375	9.75	410.7720947265625	98
matrices that organize politics, including its inter-state and international moments (Gross	113.25	472.4554443359375	9.75	409.11614990234375	98
1985; Poulantzas 1978). Thus there is no reason to assume the fixity of its frontiers or	113.25	487.4554443359375	9.75	408.80572509765625	98
temporal horizons. Second, as form-determined condensations of a changing balance of	113.25	503.2054443359375	9.75	409.361083984375	98
social forces, state apparatuses and state power will reflect the manifold processes that	113.25	518.9554443359375	9.75	409.30767822265625	98
produce globalization. Thus the state apparatus may interiorize the interests of foreign	113.25	533.9554443359375	9.75	410.94873046875	98
capital as well as project the interests of national capital abroad (Poulantzas 1975, 1978).	113.25	549.7054443359375	9.75	409.98760986328125	98
Third, the economy should not be reduced to a market-mediated space of flows operating in	113.25	565.4554443359375	9.75	410.62701416015625	98
timeless time: markets also operate in accordance with other spatio-temporalities and the	113.25	580.4554443359375	9.75	410.093994140625	98
economy more generally involves various non-market governance mechanisms with yet	113.25	596.2054443359375	9.75	408.91552734375	98
other spatio-temporal dynamics. It follows that the regularization and governance of	113.25	611.9554443359375	9.75	410.87042236328125	98
globalization involves many different scales and temporal horizons. And, fourth, the	113.25	626.9554443359375	9.75	410.76751708984375	98
specificity of many economic assets and their embedding in extra-economic institutions	113.25	642.7054443359375	9.75	409.72576904296875	98
mean that much economic activity remains place- and time-bound. Combining these	113.25	658.4554443359375	9.75	410.91229248046875	98
objections, one could conclude that the state operates as a power connector, i.e., as a nodal	113.25	673.4554443359375	9.75	411.37799072265625	98
or network state within a broader political system (Brunn 1999: 114), as well as a power	113.25	689.2054443359375	9.75	409.42791748046875	98
container; and, likewise, that the economy has important territorial dimensions (reflected in	113.25	704.9554443359375	9.75	410.083251953125	98
concepts such as industrial districts, agglomeration economies, global cities, and regional or	113.25	719.9554443359375	9.75	410.718017578125	98
national capitalisms). Thus we should focus on the changing organization of politics and	113.25	735.7054443359375	9.75	409.3226318359375	98

economics and their respective institutional embodiments and see frontiers and borders as	71.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	410.03594970703125	100
actively reproduced and contingent rather than as pregiven and fixed.	71.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	306.6445617675781	100
Another false opposition involves treating the state as a political force and globalization as	71.25	155.2054443359375	9.75	409.9988098144531	101
an economic process with the corollary that their relationship is zero-sum in nature. This	71.25	170.9554443359375	9.75	409.7197570800781	101
ignores how states help to constitute the economy as an object of regulation and the extent	71.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	410.544677734375	101
to which even economic globalization continues to depend on politics. For the capital relation	71.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	410.906494140625	101
is constitutively incomplete and needs extra -economic supplementation if the inherently	71.25	217.4554443359375	9.75	409.0401611328125	101
improbable process of accumulation is to continue. States are heavily involved in this	71.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	408.2282409667969	101
supplementation both directly and through their modulation of other extra-economic modes	71.25	248.2054443359375	9.75	410.43060302734375	101
of regulation; and their equally improbable capacity to achieve this depends in part on	71.25	263.9554443359375	9.75	408.692138671875	101
revenues and resources derived from the accumulation process. In short, state-economy	71.25	278.9554443359375	9.75	410.8651428222656	101
relations inevitably involve reciprocal interdependence, prompt attempts at strategic co-	71.25	294.7054443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	101
ordination, and produce structural coupling. It cannot be understood in zero-sum terms.	71.25	310.4554443359375	9.75	409.6810607910156	101
Attempts to do so also ignore the complexities of globalization. Not only are many states	71.25	325.4554443359375	9.75	409.5368347167969	101
actively involved in constituting the conditions for globalization, which is multiform and hence	71.25	341.2054443359375	9.75	410.79052734375	101
contested, but globalization is also linked to processes on other scales, such as	71.25	356.9554443359375	9.75	410.625	101
regionalization, triadization, international localization, and cross-borderization, and states	71.25	371.9554443359375	9.75	409.15509033203125	101
engage in promoting/resisting these processes too. Finally, zero-sum analyses ignore the	71.25	387.7054443359375	9.75	409.7259826660156	101
extent to which the unfolding economic logic (and illogic) of globalization can constrain firms	71.25	403.4554443359375	9.75	410.71063232421875	101
as well as political actors.	71.25	418.4554443359375	9.75	112.44264221191406	101
This leads us to a third area of conceptual confusion: the claim that globalization puts	71.25	449.9554443359375	9.75	408.7022705078125	102
pressure on the sovereign state. This is misleading for four reasons. First, sovereignty is only	71.25	464.9554443359375	9.75	410.8362121582031	102
one aspect of the form of the modern state. As a specific juridico-political form, sovereignty	71.25	480.7054443359375	9.75	410.39154052734375	102
certainly organizes key features of state power; but it is struggles over state power that are	71.25	496.4554443359375	9.75	410.22821044921875	102
ultimately primary, not the particular forms in which it is exercised. Forms of sovereignty have	71.25	511.4554443359375	9.75	410.8819274902344	102
been reorganized in the past and a post-sovereign international system is imaginable.	71.25	527.2054443359375	9.75	408.4920654296875	102
Second, it is not the State as such (sovereign or otherwise) that is pressured by	71.25	542.9554443359375	9.75	410.88372802734375	102
globalization. The processes that generate globalization can only put pressure on particular	71.25	557.9554443359375	9.75	410.3917236328125	102
forms of state with particular state capacities and liabilities, such as the Keynesian Welfare	71.25	573.7054443359375	9.75	410.1654052734375	102
National State in Atlantic Fordism or the Listian Workfare National State in East Asian	71.25	589.4554443359375	9.75	410.89410400390625	102
Exportism.2 In so doing, it also modifies the balance of forces within states. For any	71.25	601.6806640625	12.5247802734375	410.92242431640625	102
differential loss of capacities will favour some fractions, classes, and social forces over	71.25	620.2054443359375	9.75	408.7212829589844	102
others; it also creates space for, and prompts, struggles to reorganize state forms and	71.25	635.9554443359375	9.75	408.6632385253906	102
capacities. Important aspects of such pressures are the acceleration of economic decision-	71.25	650.9554443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	102
making and temporal compression of significant economic events relative to the time	71.25	666.7054443359375	9.75	410.87335205078125	102
required for considered political decision-making. This weakens what one might call the ‘time	71.25	682.4554443359375	9.75	410.8164367675781	102
sovereignty’ of the state in its current form. Third, since globalization is not a single causal	71.25	697.4554443359375	9.75	410.8339538574219	102

mechanism with a universal, unitary logic but is multicentric, multiscalar, multitemporal, and	113.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	410.1807861328125	106
multiform, it does not generate a single, uniform set of pressures. All states and state	113.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	410.8834228515625	106
capacities will be pressured by globalization but each will be affected in different ways.	113.25	139.4554443359375	9.75	408.8333740234375	106
Indeed, while some states actively promote globalization, others can be seen as its victims.	113.25	155.2054443359375	9.75	409.54486083984375	106
Thus, even if one agreed that globalization mainly means Americanization, the ‘Great Satan’	113.25	170.9554443359375	9.75	410.8775634765625	106
would still experience pressures emanating from other centres and forms of globalization as	113.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	410.55279541015625	106
well as from the internal impact of its own neo -liberal form and the resistance it inevitably	113.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	410.188720703125	106
generates at home and abroad. Similar arguments hold for the differential impact of the	113.25	217.4554443359375	9.75	409.50665283203125	106
multiscalar nature of globalization, with states being differentially involved in various scalar	113.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	410.02984619140625	106
projects and processes; and about that of its multitemporal nature, with some states more	113.25	248.2054443359375	9.75	410.0213623046875	106
actively involved in and/or more vulnerable to time-space distantiation and compression.	113.25	263.9554443359375	9.75	409.05731201171875	106
And, fourth, we should note that some aspects of globalization might actually enhance rather	113.25	278.9554443359375	9.75	410.80792236328125	106
than diminish state capacities.	113.25	294.7054443359375	9.75	133.40774536132812	106
Having clarified possible misconceptions, we can now consider how (national) states are	113.25	325.4554443359375	9.75	409.83441162109375	107
involved in, and affected, by globalization. In broad terms, states are actively engaged in	113.25	341.2054443359375	9.75	409.515625	107
redrawing the spatio-temporal matrices within which capital operates. In doing so, they are	113.25	356.9554443359375	9.75	410.06854248046875	107
trying to manage the tension between potentially mobile capital’s interests in reducing its	113.25	371.9554443359375	9.75	409.6961669921875	107
place-dependency and/or liberating itself from temporal constraints, on the one hand, and,	113.25	387.7054443359375	9.75	410.0570068359375	107
on the other hand, their own interest in fixing (allegedly beneficial)3 capital within their own	113.25	400.6806945800781	12.524749755859375	410.3258056640625	107
territories and rendering capital’s temporal horizons and rhythms compatible with their statal	113.25	418.4554443359375	9.75	410.76617431640625	107
and/or political routines, temporalities, and crisis-tendencies. For, as globalization increases,	113.25	434.2054443359375	9.75	410.86370849609375	107
national states can no longer presume, as they did in the heyday of Atlantic Fordism, that	113.25	449.9554443359375	9.75	410.10302734375	107
their primary economic task is to govern a relatively closed national economy – instead they	113.25	464.9554443359375	9.75	410.8284912109375	107
are increasingly involved in managing a range of transnational processes and creating the	113.25	480.7054443359375	9.75	410.11761474609375	107
spatial and temporal fixes appropriate thereto. Of particular importance here is the changing	113.25	496.4554443359375	9.75	410.78302001953125	107
relationship between the economic and the extra-economic factors bearing on	113.25	511.4554443359375	9.75	410.88897705078125	107
competitiveness and states’ own role in redefining the boundaries between the economic	113.25	527.2054443359375	9.75	409.2979736328125	107
and extra-economic and/or reorganizing the latter and subordinating them to the perceived	113.25	542.9554443359375	9.75	410.11309814453125	107
demands and pressures of globalization. Thus, to take a paradoxical example, even as neo-	113.25	557.9554443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	107
liberal states seem to disengage from the market economy, they intervene more in the extra-	113.25	573.7054443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	107
economic field and subordinate it to the demands of valorization.	113.25	589.4554443359375	9.75	284.2129211425781	107
More generally, the activities of capitalist states, almost regardless of their specific form and	113.25	620.2054443359375	9.75	410.7694091796875	108
projects, have been reshaping the spatio-temporal matrices of globalization. Their roles here	113.25	635.9554443359375	9.75	410.58392333984375	108
reflect the balance of internal and external forces, with some more willing and active	113.25	650.9554443359375	9.75	410.94903564453125	108
participants in these processes than others. Nonetheless, among many relevant activities,	113.25	666.7054443359375	9.75	409.5572509765625	108
we can mention: deregulating, liberalizing, and shaping the institutional architecture of	113.25	682.4554443359375	9.75	410.89764404296875	108
3 Excluded here, for example, might be heavily polluting industries that may be encouraged to relocate – with	113.25	736.1930541992188	8.25	410.72967529296875	109
their products being imported – rather than to undertake expensive environmental protection measures.	127.5	747.4430541992188	8.25	366.8392028808594	109

region formation, regional bloc formation, and participating in forums for inter-triad	71.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	410.7425537109375	111

partnerships or place-bound market forces and thereby linking them to market -oriented	71.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	410.7789001464844	111

functional authority (including international regimes) and/or to mobile market forces;	71.25	263.9554443359375	9.75	410.8972473144531	111

making national states responsible for enforcing international agreements on global	71.25	294.7054443359375	9.75	410.91021728515625	111
warming); and, finally, addressing the multiformity of globalization processes by engaging in	71.25	310.4554443359375	9.75	410.7359313964844	111
the struggle to define the rules for harmonizing or standardizing a wide range of	71.25	325.4554443359375	9.75	410.9804992675781	111
technological, economic, juridico-political, socio-cultural, and environmental issues.	71.25	341.2054443359375	9.75	366.63909912109375	111
More specifically, given the multicentric and multiform nature of globalization, some states	71.25	371.9554443359375	9.75	409.56707763671875	112
are committed to promoting their own national or regional capitalisms and the appropriate	71.25	387.7054443359375	9.75	409.6474914550781	112
conditions for the expanded reproduction of these forms of capitalism on a global scale. The	71.25	403.4554443359375	9.75	410.73651123046875	112
neo-liberal project has, of course, been most successful in this regard in the past two	71.25	418.4554443359375	9.75	408.5941162109375	112
decades; but it has not gone uncontested and the European model in particular may regain	71.25	434.2054443359375	9.75	410.24664306640625	112
ground in the coming decade. They are also establishing new scales of activity (and	71.25	449.9554443359375	9.75	410.9202880859375	112
dismantling others) and thereby rescaling and re-articulating various state powers,	71.25	464.9554443359375	9.75	410.9152526855469	112
institutional forms, and regulatory capacities and creating the possibility for themselves and	71.25	480.7054443359375	9.75	410.2366027832031	112

of flows by organizing conditions favourable to the international mobility of technologies,	71.25	511.4554443359375	9.75	409.4081115722656	112

power. And, conversely, they are engaged in complementary forms of Standortpolitik and	71.25	542.9554443359375	9.75	411.1709899902344	112
other forms of place-based competition in the attempt to fix mobile capital in their own	71.25	557.9554443359375	9.75	409.7337341308594	112

6. Globalization, Time, and the State	113.25	106.75494384765625	15.75	272.1839904785156	114
An important source of pressure on states comes from the growing complexity of the political	113.25	143.2054443359375	9.75	410.83758544921875	115
economy of time and its implications for politics as the ‘art of the possible’. States	113.25	158.9554443359375	9.75	410.93450927734375	115
increasingly face temporal pressures in their policy-making and implementation due to new	113.25	173.9554443359375	9.75	410.15625	115
forms of time-space distantiation, compression, and differentiation. For, as the temporalities	113.25	189.7054443359375	9.75	410.3294677734375	115
of the economy accelerate relative to those of the state, the time to determine and co-	113.25	205.4554443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	115
ordinate political responses to economic events shrinks – especially in relation to superfast	113.25	220.4554443359375	9.75	410.280517578125	115
and/or hypermobile capital. This reinforces conflicts between the time(s) of the state and the	113.25	236.2054443359375	9.75	410.77362060546875	115
time(s) of the market. One solution to the state’s loss of time sovereignty is laissez-faire. This	113.25	251.9554443359375	9.75	410.8758544921875	115
approach reinforces the temporality of deregulated exchange-value, however, which	113.25	266.9554443359375	9.75	410.9473876953125	115
becomes problematic when market forces provoke economic crises and states are expected	113.25	282.7054443359375	9.75	410.71826171875	115
to respond. Two other options are for states to try to compress their own decision-making	113.25	298.4554443359375	9.75	410.73724365234375	115
cycles so that they can make more timely and appropriate interventions and/or to attempt to	113.25	313.4554443359375	9.75	410.7962646484375	115
decelerate the activities of ‘fast capitalism’ to match existing political routines.	113.25	329.2054443359375	9.75	340.4297180175781	115
A strategy of temporal compression increases pressures to make decisions on the basis of	113.25	359.9554443359375	9.75	410.15924072265625	116
unreliable information, insufficient consultation, lack of participation, etc., even as state	113.25	375.7054443359375	9.75	411.679931640625	116
managers believe that policy is still taking too long to negotiate, formulate, enact, adjudicate,	113.25	391.4554443359375	9.75	410.79620361328125	116
determine, and implement. The commitment to ‘fast policy’ is reflected in the shortening of	113.25	406.4554443359375	9.75	410.04510498046875	116
policy development cycles, fast-tracking decision-making, rapid programme rollout,	113.25	422.2054443359375	9.75	410.91827392578125	116
continuing policy experimentation, institutional and policy Darwinism, and relentless revision	113.25	437.9554443359375	9.75	410.252685546875	116
of guidelines and benchmarks. This privileges those who can operate within compressed	113.25	452.9554443359375	9.75	409.2913818359375	116
time scales, narrows the range of participants in the policy process, and limits the scope for	113.25	468.7054443359375	9.75	410.81329345703125	116
deliberation, consultation, and negotiation. This can significantly affect the choice of policies,	113.25	484.4554443359375	9.75	410.8287353515625	116
the initial targets of policy, the sites where policy is implemented, and the criteria adopted to	113.25	499.4554443359375	9.75	410.8211669921875	116
demonstrate success. It also affects whether any lessons learnt are relevant to other targets,	113.25	515.2054443359375	9.75	410.85284423828125	116
sites, or criteria; and it discourages proper evaluation of a policy’s impact over different	113.25	530.9554443359375	9.75	408.85211181640625	116
spatio-temporal horizons, including delayed and/or unintended consequences and feedback	113.25	545.9554443359375	9.75	410.2376708984375	116
effects. In such situations, ‘spin’ trumps substance and modifies the nature of politics and	113.25	561.7054443359375	9.75	409.5555419921875	116
policy-making. It may also help to accelerate policy-making and implementation cycles so	113.25	577.4554443359375	9.75	408.4927978515625	116
that different approaches are tried in rapid succession as each is seen to fail. One symptom	113.25	592.4554443359375	9.75	411.3262939453125	116
of this is the shortening ‘half life’ of legislation and other policies (Scheuerman 2001: 91–2). It	113.25	608.2054443359375	9.75	410.6845703125	116
also produces the dilemma that unchanged policies become irrelevant or even	113.25	623.9554443359375	9.75	410.8509521484375	116
counterproductive whilst constant changes in policies risk being seen as opportunistic or	113.25	638.9554443359375	9.75	409.50811767578125	116
illegitimate (on the case of law, for example, see de Sousa Santos 1995).	113.25	654.7054443359375	9.75	322.44085693359375	116
Even if fast policy appears irrational from a purely policy-making perspective, it may still be	113.25	685.4554443359375	9.75	409.6661376953125	117
rational for some interests in politics- or polity-making terms. For fast policy is antagonistic to	113.25	701.2054443359375	9.75	410.17376708984375	117
corporatism, stakeholding, the rule of law, formal bureaucracy, and, indeed, to the routines	113.25	716.9554443359375	9.75	410.14764404296875	117
and cycles of democratic politics more generally. It privileges the executive over the	113.25	731.9554443359375	9.75	410.8597412109375	117

legislature and the judiciary, finance over industrial capital, consumption over long -term	71.25	108.7054443359375	9.75	410.8125	119
investment. In general, resort to fast policy undermines the power of decision-makers who	71.25	124.4554443359375	9.75	410.4129943847656	119
have long decision-taking cycles – because they lose the capacity to make decisions in	71.25	139.4554443359375	9.75	409.4608459472656	119
terms of their own routines and procedures, having to adapt to the speed of the fast policy	71.25	155.2054443359375	9.75	410.16070556640625	119
takers. It also tends to destroy institutional memory, on the grounds that new circumstances	71.25	170.9554443359375	9.75	410.7532958984375	119
require new approaches, and to block efforts to anticipate future difficulties and policy	71.25	185.9554443359375	9.75	410.9461669921875	119
failures. Hence the present is extended at the expense of both past and future and politics is	71.25	201.7054443359375	9.75	410.10125732421875	119
lived in the mediatized world of spin and presentation, the quick fix, rapid churning of	71.25	217.4554443359375	9.75	408.58673095703125	119
policies, and plebiscitarian democracy (cf. Chesneaux 2000; Hoogerwoof 1990; Santiso and	71.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	410.8046569824219	119

An alternative strategy is not to compress absolute political time but to create relative	71.25	325.4554443359375	9.75	408.57269287109375	120
political time by slowing the circuits of capital. Perhaps the most celebrated, if not yet	71.25	341.2054443359375	9.75	408.6832275390625	120
implemented, example of this strategy is the Tobin tax, which would decelerate the flow of	71.25	356.9554443359375	9.75	409.97393798828125	120
superfast and hypermobile financial capital and limit its distorting impact on the real economy	71.25	371.9554443359375	9.75	410.78387451171875	120
(see Jetin and de Brunhoff 2000). Other examples include an energy tax on fossil fuels and	71.25	387.7054443359375	9.75	410.5868225097656	120
nuclear power, consistent introduction of the polluter pays principle on a global scale, resort	71.25	403.4554443359375	9.75	410.78326416015625	120
to a worldwide prudential principle in the introduction of new technologies, and inclusion of	71.25	418.4554443359375	9.75	410.1035461425781	120
recycling and disposal costs in pricing goods (Altvater and Mahnkopf 1999). For these could	71.25	434.2054443359375	9.75	410.8386535644531	120
tilt the balance away from globalization in favour of regional and local economies, slow the	71.25	449.9554443359375	9.75	410.0356140136719	120
rate of environmental destruction, and allow proper evaluation of the likely consequences of	71.25	464.9554443359375	9.75	410.6413879394531	120
technological innovation. This could be supplemented by a fourth political time-management	71.25	480.7054443359375	9.75	410.8401184082031	120
option. This is to establish the institutional framework for subsidiaritarian guided self-	71.25	496.4554443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	120
regulation on various scales as well as for continuous monitoring of how well such self-	71.25	511.4554443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	120
regulation is operating in the light of agreed criteria (Scheuerman 2001). This strategy of	71.25	527.2054443359375	9.75	409.334716796875	120
reflexive metagovernance would enable the state to retain the capacity to co-ordinate	71.25	542.9554443359375	9.75	410.8095397949219	120
activities across different time zones and temporalities without the risk of overload	71.25	557.9554443359375	9.75	410.9312438964844	120
(Hoogerwerf 1990).	71.25	573.7054443359375	9.75	84.76679992675781	120
More generally, on the temporal front, states are getting involved in promoting new temporal	71.25	604.4554443359375	9.75	411.4878845214844	121
horizons of action and new forms of temporal flexibility, in coping with the increased salience	71.25	620.2054443359375	9.75	410.6883850097656	121
of multiple time zones (in commerce, diplomacy, security, etc.), in recalibrating and managing	71.25	635.9554443359375	9.75	410.84722900390625	121
the intersection of temporalities (e.g., regulating computer-programmed trading, promoting	71.25	650.9554443359375	9.75	409.8833312988281	121
the 24-hour city as centre of consumption, managing environmental risk), and socializing	71.25	666.7054443359375	9.75	409.38763427734375	121
long-term conditions of production as short -term calculation becomes more important for	71.25	682.4554443359375	9.75	409.21502685546875	121
marketized economic activities. Of particular importance is the restructuring of welfare	71.25	697.4554443359375	9.75	410.9275207519531	121
regimes to promote flexible economic and social adjustment and socialize its costs as	71.25	713.2054443359375	9.75	408.61553955078125	121
economies become more vulnerable to the cyclical fluctuations and other vagaries of the	71.25	728.9554443359375	9.75	409.5320129394531	121
world market (Jessop 1999b, 1999c). Such a welfare orientation was always a feature of	71.25	743.9554443359375	9.75	409.33514404296875	121

7. Conclusions	113.25	184.00494384765625	15.75	113.16525268554688	124
I will draw two sets of conclusions. The first set concerns globalization and time. I hope to	113.25	220.4554443359375	9.75	410.02935791015625	125
have shown that globalization is not just a spatial or scalar phenomenon; it is also temporal.	113.25	236.2054443359375	9.75	410.75494384765625	125
It is best studied in terms of differential articulation of time -space distantiation and time-	113.25	251.9554443359375	9.75	410.49676513671875	125
space compression and their repercussions on power relations and social dynamics. Indeed,	113.25	266.9554443359375	9.75	410.87353515625	125
insofar as globalization is linked to the logics of capital accumulation, time is more significant	113.25	282.7054443359375	9.75	410.8963623046875	125
than space – because accumulation rests on ‘economy of time’. Global capitalism weakens	113.25	298.4554443359375	9.75	410.2176513671875	125
national states through its adverse impact on their claims to time sovereignty as well as to	113.25	313.4554443359375	9.75	410.12762451171875	125
territorial sovereignty. This suggests the need to reorganize the spatio-temporal fixes within	113.25	329.2054443359375	9.75	410.15313720703125	125
which moments of relative structural coherence and stability can occur through the	113.25	344.9554443359375	9.75	410.84765625	125
displacement and/or deferral of certain of the contradictions and dilemmas of capitalism	113.25	359.9554443359375	9.75	409.01617431640625	125
beyond the spatio-temporal horizons with which that fix is associated. But it also means that	113.25	375.7054443359375	9.75	410.79132080078125	125
there can never be global stability or an unlimited process of global accumulation in an	113.25	391.4554443359375	9.75	409.2144775390625	125
undifferentiated world market. For spatio-temporal pockets of stable capital accumulation	113.25	406.4554443359375	9.75	409.03466796875	125
rests on specific spatio-temporal fixes. This is never a global stability – it is always	113.25	422.2054443359375	9.75	410.82147216796875	125
spatialized, temporalized, and differential. This in turn implies that attempts to control the	113.25	437.9554443359375	9.75	409.47344970703125	125
globalization of the capital relation entail control over its temporalities as well as its	113.25	452.9554443359375	9.75	410.95751953125	125
spatialities. As well as thinking global, acting local, we must also think glacial, act everyday.	113.25	468.7054443359375	9.75	401.19073486328125	125
This brings me to the second set of conclusions, concerning the role of the state in	113.25	499.4554443359375	9.75	409.31793212890625	126
constituting these socio-spatial fixes and managing the temporalities as well as spatialities of	113.25	515.2054443359375	9.75	410.78228759765625	126
capital accumulation. The national state has long played a key role in establishing and	113.25	530.9554443359375	9.75	408.68450927734375	126
regulating the relationship between the spatial and the temporal matrices of social life	113.25	545.9554443359375	9.75	408.5631103515625	126
(Poulantzas, 1978: 114). This remains true in a period of globalization but the forms in which	113.25	561.7054443359375	9.75	410.667724609375	126
the state is involved therein have been changing. For the state is involved in modifying the	113.25	577.4554443359375	9.75	410.2003173828125	126
spatio-temporal matrices of capitalism and the nation; and it has a key role in managing the	113.25	592.4554443359375	9.75	410.59881591796875	126
uneven spatio-temporal development engendered by the capital relation. In many significant	113.25	608.2054443359375	9.75	410.70684814453125	126
respects the processes that produce globalization have undermined the effectiveness of the	113.25	623.9554443359375	9.75	410.62384033203125	126
national state (in its postwar forms) because specific powers and capacities have become	113.25	638.9554443359375	9.75	409.96099853515625	126
less relevant to the new spatio-temporal matrices, the reversal of the relative significance of	113.25	654.7054443359375	9.75	410.68560791015625	126
wages as cost of production and source of demand and of money as national money and	113.25	670.4554443359375	9.75	409.971923828125	126
international currency as these functioned in Atlantic Fordism, and the increased significance	113.25	685.4554443359375	9.75	410.89892578125	126
of competition and state forms as sites of contradictions and dilemmas in a globalizing,	113.25	701.2054443359375	9.75	408.84942626953125	126
knowledge-driven economy (see Jessop 2002). Nonetheless a restructured national state	113.25	716.9554443359375	9.75	410.94061279296875	126
remains central to the effective management of the emerging spatio-temporal matrices of	113.25	731.9554443359375	9.75	409.85443115234375	126

globalization in the strongest sense of this polyvalent, promiscuous, and controversial word	71.25	232.4554443359375	9.75	410.2131042480469	128
(i.e., the emergence of a borderless planetary economy – an entity widely and rightly	71.25	248.2054443359375	9.75	408.4383850097656	128
regarded as mythical) than they do with the more general spatio-temporal restructuring of	71.25	263.9554443359375	9.75	409.88995361328125	128
contemporary capitalism. This is why my own discussion of globalization has focused on the	71.25	278.9554443359375	9.75	410.684814453125	128
complex spatio-temporal logics of globalization and their manifold implications for state	71.25	294.7054443359375	9.75	410.86138916015625	128
power. In doing so I hope to have contributed in a small way to demystifying globalization	71.25	310.4554443359375	9.75	410.0006103515625	128
and illustrating the ways in which its associated spatio-temporal transformations can be	71.25	325.4554443359375	9.75	409.1674499511719	128
modified and controlled.	71.25	341.2054443359375	9.75	104.99247741699219	128
