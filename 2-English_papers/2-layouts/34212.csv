Abstract	286.010009765625	380.60894775390625	12.0	39.972015380859375	8
European political elites are faced with a loss of trust and the emergence of a growing number of sometimes	108.0199966430664	405.6751403808594	9.959991455078125	396.0022201538086	9
rather obscure new political movements. How is this to be explained? What is the relationship between the	108.0199966430664	417.19512939453125	9.959991455078125	395.4618148803711	9
logic that guides political attitudes of constituencies and the logic of political actors whose legitimacy is	108.0199966430664	428.6151428222656	9.959991455078125	395.58126068115234	9
rooted in electoral choice of the constituencies? In this essay we approach this question from a systemic	108.0199966430664	440.1351318359375	9.959991455078125	395.59569549560547	9
perspective, regarding this relationship as a problem solving feedback cycle. Classical approaches, such as	108.0199966430664	451.6551513671875	9.959991455078125	395.6410140991211	9
the median voter theorem, view political actors as passively mirroring voters’ preferences. An alternative	108.0199966430664	463.0551452636719	9.959991455078125	395.8954086303711	9
approach that we suggest, assumes that the perception of competences of political actors on the part of	108.0199966430664	474.57513427734375	9.959991455078125	395.6111068725586	9
constituencies is key in the sense that it does not only reflect voters’ preferences, but it is also manipulable	108.0199966430664	486.09515380859375	9.959991455078125	395.9307174682617	9
through the agency of political actors themselves. More generally, we argue that the perception of	108.0199966430664	497.4951477050781	9.959991455078125	395.60118865966797	9
competence is socially constructed and contextually dependent.	108.0199966430664	509.0151062011719	9.959991455078125	231.29109954833984	9

European democracies seem to be facing a crisis. In Greece the political system of the last 40	108.0199966430664	140.0989990234375	12.0	431.54402923583984	18
years is called into question. Loss of trust in the leaders of the party system of the last 40 years has led to	72.02400207519531	153.89898681640625	12.0	467.42405700683594	18
the emergence of new political actors that nearly entered the government. After being governed by experts	72.02400207519531	167.5789794921875	12.0	467.60032653808594	18
without democratic legitimacy, Italy seems to be lost in a permanent political crisis. Beppe Grillo’s Five	72.02400207519531	181.37896728515625	12.0	467.5680389404297	18

of politics in general. 2010 municipal elections in Reykjavík, Iceland, were won by the Best Party, a quasi-	72.02400207519531	208.97900390625	12.0	468.2519989013672	18

near the city airport. A candidate at 2009 Croatian local elections gathered sizable electoral support with a	72.02400207519531	250.28900146484375	12.0	467.5561981201172	18
cynical slogan: “Everything to me, nothing to you!” Another, somewhat less successful candidate at 2011	72.02400207519531	264.07183837890625	12.01715087890625	467.85398864746094	18
Croatian parliamentary elections, based his campaign on complete avoidance of public talk, under a	72.02400207519531	277.76898193359375	11.999969482421875	467.4601287841797	18
quizzical slogan: “Silence is gold. I’ll talk in the Parliament!” (Srbljinovic, 2013). Politicians in Romania do	72.02400207519531	291.55181884765625	12.017120361328125	468.09996032714844	18
not seem to perceive political competitors as legitimate. Numerous additional examples of bizarre would-be	72.02400207519531	305.36895751953125	12.0	468.02793884277344	18
political leaders and caricatural political parties can be found in many European countries. In Eastern	72.02400207519531	319.1689453125	12.0	467.5920867919922	18
European countries there is also a growing body of literature on loss of trust in political actors as a	72.02400207519531	332.84893798828125	12.0	467.7140350341797	18
consequence of poor performance and corruption of political actors who are not believed to serve the	72.02400207519531	346.6489562988281	12.0	467.44810485839844	18
interests of the common public (Voinea, 2012; Atanasov and Cvetanova, 2012). The first Croatian 2013	72.02400207519531	360.4489440917969	12.0	468.07591247558594	18
elections for the EU Parliament were marked by a very low turnout (around 20%) and an unusually high	72.02400207519531	374.2489318847656	12.0	467.44810485839844	18
number of invalid ballots (more than 5%), most of which were intentionally spoiled as an expression of	72.02400207519531	387.928955078125	12.0	467.4480438232422	18
outrage at ruling political elites, both those of the ruling coalition as well as those in the opposition. It is	72.02400207519531	401.72894287109375	12.0	467.72618103027344	18
somewhat paradoxical that in case those ballots were cast for the same party, this hypothetical “Party of	72.02400207519531	415.5289306640625	12.0	467.5441131591797	18
the Disaffected” would enter the EU Parliament.	72.02400207519531	429.22894287109375	12.0	207.7198944091797	18
Where does this apparent crisis of political representation and representatives come from? Can	108.0199966430664	443.0289306640625	12.0	431.7541732788086	18
this be analysed in a systematic manner, instead of simply blaming political leaders of being morally	72.02400207519531	456.8289489746094	12.0	467.6041717529297	18
corrupted? While this moral argument might not miss the point entirely, it needs further explanation. For this	72.02400207519531	470.6289367675781	12.0	468.0759735107422	18
reason we shall try to approach this problem from different angles in a number of essays in the following	72.02400207519531	484.3089294433594	12.0	467.4720916748047	18
issues of the European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities. Our thesis is that the crisis is	72.02400207519531	498.10894775390625	12.0	467.30406188964844	18
twofold: on the side of constituencies, trust in politicians is low. On the other side, however – the side of	72.02400207519531	511.908935546875	12.0	468.09996032714844	18
political actors – not very reliable candidates receive significant support at elections. The purpose of the	72.02400207519531	525.708984375	12.000015258789062	467.5519256591797	18
essays is to suggest a framework for a theoretical model of how formation of political attitudes and	72.02400207519531	539.3889770507812	12.0	467.81809997558594	18
democratic selection of political action and actors are interrelated. In this first essay we shall examine a	72.02400207519531	553.18896484375	12.0	467.47215270996094	18
systemic perspective on the problem: in principle, democracy should enable selection of political actors	72.02400207519531	566.9889526367188	12.0	468.17198181152344	18
who would adequately represent political attitudes of the society. However, as it seems, this has not	72.02400207519531	580.7889404296875	12.0	467.5560760498047	18
operated well in the past years. We examine this problem in more abstract terms by regarding social	72.02400207519531	594.4989624023438	12.0	467.46006774902344	18
systems as problem solving systems. The classical approach to investigate the relationship between	72.02400207519531	608.2989501953125	12.0	467.8300018310547	18
political actors and political attitudes is the median voter theorem. It is suggested that this relationship can	72.02400207519531	622.0989379882812	12.0	467.4359588623047	18
be addressed by a more general notion of – perceived – competence.	72.02400207519531	635.89892578125	12.0	303.2021026611328	18
However, structures are enacted by actors. For this reason, the following essay will concentrate on	108.0199966430664	649.5789794921875	12.0	431.70613861083984	18
the perspective of political actors: why do political entrepreneurs often seem to be “more rational” than their	72.02400207519531	663.3789672851562	12.0	467.4720916748047	18
audience - why do they often look like they “exploit” the audience for their own interests and aims, as stated	72.02400207519531	677.178955078125	12.0	467.95005798339844	18
openly in this grotesque claim: “Everything to me, nothing to you”? To investigate this question we rely on	72.02400207519531	690.9578247070312	12.01715087890625	467.95005798339844	18

In the final essay we shall integrate the systemic and the actor perspective. For this purpose we	108.0199966430664	147.0589599609375	12.0	431.4238510131836	23
develop the notion of distributed reflexivity. This allows to sketch the long-term dynamics of the mechanism	72.02400207519531	160.85894775390625	12.0	468.2319793701172	23
relating political actors and attitudes. Here we follow the research programme of deliberative democracy	72.02400207519531	174.53900146484375	12.0	467.5801239013672	23
approaches (Bohman, 1995; Benhabib, 1996; Chambers, 2003) to investigate the emergence (and possible	72.02400207519531	188.3389892578125	12.0	467.55613708496094	23
decline) of legitimacy of democratic political leadership. According to this view, democratic legitimacy arises	72.02400207519531	202.13897705078125	12.0	467.7980194091797	23
out of free and unconstrained public discourse (Benhabib, 1996). However, this approach has not been	72.02400207519531	215.93896484375	12.0	467.42405700683594	23
uncontested. Free discourse does not guarantee that simply by the principles of discourse justice and	72.02400207519531	229.61895751953125	12.0	468.11192321777344	23
common goods are achieved, but free discourse might also lead to agonistic pluralism (Mouffe, 1999). The	72.02400207519531	243.4189453125	12.0	467.5439910888672	23
examples of frivolous, would-be politicians demonstrate empirically that discourse might not lead to morally	72.02400207519531	257.24896240234375	12.0	467.79808044433594	23
desirable results. Thus we end with the open question of whether the current crisis indicates a process of	72.02400207519531	271.0489501953125	12.0	467.7261199951172	23
distributed reflexivity or communicative bubbles. The future will show.	72.02400207519531	284.72894287109375	12.0	301.1880645751953	23
2. An Abstract Formulation of the Problem	72.02400207519531	326.1289367675781	12.0	204.9919891357422	24
In more abstract terms, social systems can be regarded as problem solving systems. Governments	108.0199966430664	339.8089294433594	12.0	432.01399993896484	24
provide specialised institutions in order to solve problems that concern the whole of a society (Almond et	72.02400207519531	353.60894775390625	12.0	467.49607849121094	24
al., 2006; Cioffi-Revilla, 2009).2 Sometimes they fail to do so as demonstrated, for instance, by the	72.02400207519531	367.408935546875	12.0	467.7141571044922	24
breakdown of the Soviet system. Less dramatically, in democratic systems a government might be	72.02400207519531	381.2089538574219	12.0	467.6400604248047	24
deselected because it is perceived as insufficiently or inadequately solving societal problems. Thus, it can	72.02400207519531	394.8889465332031	12.0	468.09996032714844	24
be said that the duty of a government is to develop policies in order to solve societal problems. In	72.02400207519531	408.6889343261719	12.0	467.4481658935547	24
democratic societies the people is the sovereign of the state,3 hence the duty of the sovereign is to select	72.02400207519531	422.5089416503906	12.0	467.87815856933594	24
an appropriate problem-solving agency. Thus a self-organised feedback cycle between political attitudes	72.02400207519531	436.3089294433594	12.0	467.9261932373047	24
and political actors exists (Markisic et al., 2012).	72.02400207519531	449.98895263671875	12.0	208.8600616455078	24
Whereas politicians have the organisational capacities to set the agenda (Arnold, 1990), citizens of	108.0199966430664	463.7889404296875	12.0	431.56807708740234	24
democratic societies select one of the proposed political agendas. However, as the above examples of	72.02400207519531	477.5889587402344	12.0	467.6542205810547	24
grotesque politicians indicate, there is no guarantee that this would indeed be a problem solving feedback	72.02400207519531	491.3889465332031	12.0	467.52000427246094	24
cycle. In particular, in times of crisis and uncertainty, democratic “search mechanisms” need not reach	72.02400207519531	505.0689697265625	12.0	467.92588806152344	24

generate solutions for problems of public concern: problem solving activities generate some state of the	72.02400207519531	546.468994140625	12.0	468.1119842529297	24
society. For instance, reducing taxes in order to increase the economic activity changes social conditions,	72.02400207519531	560.14892578125	12.0	467.5680389404297	24
introducing new opportunities and new problems. Elections decide over a future political agenda which	72.02400207519531	573.948974609375	12.0	467.4719696044922	24
might be more advantageous or disadvantageous for the society. Note that a sharp distinction between	72.02400207519531	587.7489624023438	12.0	467.61814880371094	24
“stable” and “critical” pathways is only an idealisation. Actually, there might be a gradual transition between	72.02400207519531	601.5789794921875	12.0	467.45994567871094	24
2 Theories of the evolution of social complexity (Cohen, 1985; Tuzin, 2002) emphasise that social stratification and differentiation	72.02400207519531	629.2850952148438	9.960006713867188	468.04429626464844	25
can be regarded as an evolutionary solution to the problem of population pressure.	72.02400207519531	640.8051147460938	9.960006713867188	299.2680206298828	25
3 Although this is not literally true, various definitions of democracy imply, in one way or another, that the people is indeed the	72.02400207519531	652.2051391601562	9.960006713867188	467.80686950683594	25
ultimate sovereign (cf. Bobbio, 1987, pp. 29–54; Manin, 1995, pp. 161–192; Schumpeter, 1942, p. 269; see also Dahl’s (1956, p.	72.02400207519531	663.72509765625	9.960006713867188	467.81932067871094	25

difference between democratic and authoritarian systems, however, is that the people of democratic regimes is comprised of	72.02400207519531	686.64111328125	9.960006713867188	467.9659881591797	25
individual bearers of basic and inalienable rights, while in non-democratic regimes it is the people in toto that prevails over	72.02400207519531	698.1469116210938	9.974227905273438	468.0941619873047	25

more and less efficient problem-solving activities. For instance, some decisions have to be made on how to	72.02400207519531	100.49896240234375	12.0	467.9020233154297	30

Since problems of public concern are defined by the constituencies whereas the agenda of political	108.0199966430664	546.3489379882812	12.0	431.5920639038086	32

actors and political attitudes of the people in more detail. Successful politicians are those who are	72.02400207519531	573.948974609375	12.0	467.6240692138672	32
successful in, inter alia, convincing the audience. Beside the role of the media (Habermas, 2006), this might	72.02400207519531	587.6289672851562	12.0	467.65220642089844	32
well lead to a selection pressure toward a strategic rationality of communication. These considerations	72.02400207519531	601.458984375	12.0	467.9740447998047	32

The classical approach to this question is the median voter theorem, stating that on a scale from	108.0199966430664	684.1349487304688	12.0	431.7660140991211	33

median voter (Downs, 1957). The median voter is the one who occupies the median position on the scale	72.02400207519531	105.77899169921875	12.0	468.0040740966797	38
(Figure 2). Downs has shown that in a two party system a party that best represents the median voter will	72.02400207519531	119.458984375	12.0	467.7201385498047	38
receive most votes (Srbljinovic, 2013). It follows that the median voter theorem predicts a tendency of	72.02400207519531	133.25897216796875	12.0	467.5680389404297	38

The Median Voter Theorem has been much explored in the past decades (Congleton, 2002).	108.0199966430664	467.1489562988281	12.0	431.70613861083984	40
Particularly in majority voting systems it has provided reasonable predictions. However, research also	72.02400207519531	480.9489440917969	12.0	467.85813903808594	40
revealed the limitations of the median voter theorem (Krehbiel, 2004). Here we emphasise that it is limited	72.02400207519531	494.7489318847656	12.0	467.43601989746094	40
to a one dimensional scale from right wing to left wing and an assumption of an unimodal distribution of	72.02400207519531	508.428955078125	12.0	468.12400817871094	40
political attitudes. Moreover, the scale of possible agendas is predefined by the theoretical concept: an	72.02400207519531	522.2289428710938	12.0	467.4840545654297	40
agenda is denoted as either left or right (Krehbiel, 2004). This might have been a correct reflection of the	72.02400207519531	536.0289306640625	12.0	467.44810485839844	40
historical situation in the 1960s. However, since the end of the Cold War it often remains unclear how to	72.02400207519531	549.8289794921875	12.0	467.6781463623047	40
categorise a certain agenda on a scale from left to right. For instance, in multiethnic societies votes might	72.02400207519531	563.5089721679688	12.0	467.5439910888672	40
also be divided along ethnic lines (Snyder, 2000; Mann, 2005). This finding might also hold for other	72.02400207519531	577.3089599609375	12.0	467.92601013183594	40
ideologies and social value orientations. Finally, the median voter theorem assumes that voters vote	72.02400207519531	591.1089477539062	12.0	467.55613708496094	40
according to their true preferences. This is questionable in regard to the problem outlined in the	72.02400207519531	604.93896484375	12.0	467.54417419433594	40

ridiculous slogans, such as: “Everything to me, nothing to you”? Thus the median voter theorem does	72.02400207519531	632.40185546875	12.01708984375	467.9380340576172	40
predict a certain kind of rationality of political actors, namely that they aim to maximise votes. However, it	72.02400207519531	646.218994140625	12.0	468.0341033935547	40
does so by assuming that this can be obtained by moving toward the middle of a pre-fixed scale of political	72.02400207519531	660.0189208984375	12.0	468.1121063232422	40
attitudes. This does not capture the main point of a problem solving search process – selection of a certain	72.02400207519531	673.698974609375	12.0	468.05210876464844	40

This limitation can be overcome with the notion of competence (Mueller 1989). The concept of	108.0199966430664	100.49896240234375	12.0	431.4359359741211	45
competence is related to the social construction of target population. Schneider and Ingram (1993) argue	72.02400207519531	114.178955078125	12.0	467.48411560058594	45
that addressees of policy interventions are socially constructed types of subgroups of the population. These	72.02400207519531	127.97900390625	12.0	467.61607360839844	45
types may be positive (e.g. the rich) donors or negative (e.g. minorities) receivers of state policies, and they	72.02400207519531	141.77899169921875	12.0	467.6759490966797	45

As illustrated in Figure 3, the concept of target population focuses on how politicians address	108.0199966430664	567.8289794921875	12.0	431.7422103881836	47
constituencies, e.g. targeted drug addicts have generally been construed as a weak and deviant	72.02400207519531	581.6289672851562	12.0	468.0279998779297	47
subpopulation. Similarly, Schneider and Ingram (1993) argue that a policy addressing negatively and	72.02400207519531	595.458984375	12.0	467.53221130371094	47
weakly constructed target populations such as criminals or drug addicts is mostly perceived as more	72.02400207519531	609.1389770507812	12.0	467.6040496826172	47
competent by the majority of the population if it is restrictive and burdensome (at least in the US). Thus “law	72.02400207519531	622.93896484375	12.0	467.72605895996094	47
and order” policy is likely to be perceived as competent. Here we add the reverse relation of how	72.02400207519531	636.7389526367188	12.0	467.63999938964844	47
constituencies perceive political actors. We emphasise that a political elite needs to be regarded as	72.02400207519531	650.5389404296875	12.0	468.0759735107422	47
competent in order to convince a political audience of the effectiveness of the respective policy (Mueller,	72.02400207519531	664.2189331054688	12.0	467.4838104248047	47

convince a sufficient number of followers (at least in the Western world). Thus competence is related to	72.02400207519531	105.77899169921875	12.0	467.5439910888672	52

Insofar as political actors need to convince the constituencies of their competence in problem	108.0199966430664	133.25897216796875	12.0	431.5920639038086	52
solving to gain legitimacy, the concept of competence follows deliberative democracy approach. Multiple	72.02400207519531	147.0589599609375	12.0	467.5201873779297	52
points of view are considered by this concept. However, it differs from this approach insofar as political	72.02400207519531	160.85894775390625	12.0	467.8221893310547	52
actors and constituencies are explicitly distinguished. This allows to take differential power of political	72.02400207519531	174.53900146484375	12.0	467.6520233154297	52
actors and constituencies into account. Thus far it is in line with the basic assumption of the median voter	72.02400207519531	188.3389892578125	12.0	468.0101776123047	52
theorem that political actors react to voters’ preferences. However, the concept of competence allows to	72.02400207519531	202.13897705078125	12.0	467.5802459716797	52
overcome the assumption of an unimodal distribution over a one-dimensional scale. For instance, a political	72.02400207519531	215.93896484375	12.0	467.8780975341797	52

as perceived by a single actor. This needs to be aggregated over the population. Moreover, it is important	72.02400207519531	630.8589477539062	12.0	468.1119842529297	54
to note that competence is a constructivist concept: what is essential is perceived competence, and not	72.02400207519531	644.5389404296875	12.0	467.4001922607422	54
some “objectively” measurable indicators. For instance, it might be reasonably questioned if “law and order”	72.02400207519531	658.3389282226562	11.999992370605469	467.64012145996094	54
politics is truly effective. Nevertheless, political actors may still be perceived as competent if they advocate	72.02400207519531	672.1389770507812	12.0	467.6663055419922	54
harsh measures. Perceived competence can be measured by votes. Thus, the notion of competence is	72.02400207519531	685.9349365234375	12.0	467.5682830810547	54

structures need to be regarded as competent in order to gain legitimacy. Elections provide such legitimacy	72.02400207519531	100.49896240234375	12.0	467.54393005371094	59

candidate. At least two dimensions are involved in such a “proof”: first, what kind of agenda is seen as	72.02400207519531	127.97900390625	12.0	467.6359100341797	59
facing the most urgent societal problems (e.g. economic progress, freedom, or equality). Second, what kind	72.02400207519531	141.77899169921875	12.0	467.60398864746094	59
of agenda is perceived as the most efficient to solve these problems. However, the current crisis shows that	72.02400207519531	155.458984375	12.0	468.01011657714844	59
political leaders are often no longer regarded as competent to solve societal problems. Perceived	72.02400207519531	169.25897216796875	12.0	467.5319061279297	59
competence is always only relative with regard to other competitors. Presumably frivolous politicians	72.02400207519531	183.0589599609375	12.0	467.61595153808594	59
(Srbljinovic, 2013) do not gain votes because of their competence, but due to loss of trust in the	72.02400207519531	196.85894775390625	12.0	467.5521697998047	59
competence of their competitors; i.e. protest voting can be interpreted as a signal against other candidates	72.02400207519531	210.53900146484375	12.0	467.48435974121094	59
rather than in favour of the candidate voted for.	72.02400207519531	224.3389892578125	12.0	204.5719757080078	59
In this context, corruption (in the broadest sense) is an important factor. While competence is	108.0199966430664	238.13897705078125	12.0	431.4961166381836	59
normally judged as the ability to satisfy public interest, corrupt politicians are seen as serving only partial	72.02400207519531	251.968994140625	12.0	467.5560760498047	59
interests, which implies an incentive for such politicians to frame partial interests in terms of public good.	72.02400207519531	265.64898681640625	12.0	467.88999938964844	59
Since successful political entrepreneurs are those who are successful in convincing the audience of their	72.02400207519531	279.448974609375	11.999969482421875	467.6400604248047	59
competence, a selection pressure toward a certain kind of shrewd political communication is to be	72.02400207519531	293.2489318847656	12.0	468.12400817871094	59
expected. Thus we are faced with the question that political entrepreneurs often seem to be “more rational”	72.02400207519531	307.0489501953125	12.0	467.44810485839844	59
than their audience – entrepreneurs often look like they “exploit” the audience for their own interests and	72.02400207519531	320.72894287109375	12.0	467.64793395996094	59
aims. The trustful audience seems to be “less rational” than the entrepreneurs. And grotesque candidates	72.02400207519531	334.5289306640625	12.0	467.72605895996094	59
and their followers most often seem to be disillusioned and powerless, able to see through the ongoing	72.02400207519531	348.3289489746094	12.0	467.46006774902344	59
political farce on the one hand, but unable to change much on the other. Therefore they seem to resort to	72.02400207519531	362.1289367675781	12.0	468.02806091308594	59

In this essay we investigated the problem of relationship between political actors and political	108.0199966430664	430.908935546875	12.0	431.6401596069336	60
attitudes of the people from the perspective of the constituencies. If, for instance, the constituencies regard	72.02400207519531	444.7089538574219	12.0	467.76219177246094	60
as the most urgent problem the question of polar bears in the local zoo, it can be assumed that either the	72.02400207519531	458.5089416503906	12.0	467.4241180419922	60
people do not have more serious problems or that no other political agenda is perceived as problem	72.02400207519531	472.3089294433594	12.0	467.97996520996094	60
solving. Indeed, the problems caused by globalisation or financial crisis are both rather novel and serious.	72.02400207519531	485.98895263671875	12.0	467.50828552246094	60
No solutions exist which have been proven successful in the past. In contrast to e.g. problems caused by	72.02400207519531	499.7889404296875	12.0	467.6040496826172	60
criminality or drugs, these problems produce a high degree of uncertainty, not only in terms of probability of	72.02400207519531	513.5889892578125	12.0	467.6361541748047	60
success of the proposed measures but also - and more seriously - in terms of what to do at all. In terms of	72.02400207519531	527.3889770507812	12.000015258789062	467.9139862060547	60
a search process, voting for polar bears can be regarded as a random walk. As it is known from complexity	72.02400207519531	541.0689697265625	12.0	467.7699432373047	60
theory this indeed is a reasonable strategy. Voting for candidates promising polar bears can also be	72.02400207519531	554.8689575195312	12.0	467.4960174560547	60
regarded as a mild, yet ingenious form of civil disobedience. And, it is well known from the theory of civil	72.02400207519531	568.6689453125	12.0	468.22007751464844	60
