due to political factors in the West Region of Cameroon. The causes and	40.46089172363281	78.23065185546875	10.5	311.6357879638672	10
consequences of this profound change are largely unknown. The on-going	40.46089172363281	90.05364990234375	10.5	311.7807159423828	10

tially viewed with suspicion, has affected the Mbororo favourably, especially	40.46089172363281	137.28265380859375	10.5	311.6588897705078	10

had always maintained a distance vis-à-vis the Cameroonian state: Their	40.46089172363281	267.27264404296875	10.5	311.7018585205078	10
contact with the administration was for a long time limited to simply paying	40.46089172363281	279.09564208984375	10.5	311.67567443847656	10

ety (Shulte-Tenckhof 1997). But in Cameroon, as elsewhere in Africa, the situation	60.323089599609375	478.2420654296875	9.0	291.6522216796875	12
is complicated by the fact that the United Nations and its Working Group on In-	60.323089599609375	488.3850402832031	9.0	291.9996032714844	12

“indigenous” (indigène). However, it has a very different meaning than the word	60.323089599609375	508.6710205078125	9.0	291.7619934082031	12

electoral competition and the pursuit of electoral votes made the Mbororo	68.78009796142578	66.4105224609375	10.5	311.59066009521484	15

How deep does this political participation run? What are the key criteria	88.63557434082031	101.8795166015625	10.5	291.82862854003906	15
for success? These are the main framing questions of this analysis, which	68.78007507324219	113.7025146484375	10.5	311.65257263183594	15
originated from the work I have been carrying out for quite some time in	68.78007507324219	125.5255126953125	10.5	311.60118103027344	15

This shift of attention has required a degree of openness regarding the inter-	68.78007507324219	172.7545166015625	10.5	311.79747009277344	15

minority position. In this way, my approach was exploratory. To achieve	68.78007507324219	196.4005126953125	10.5	311.67784118652344	15
these goals, I used three research techniques: I examined written sources and	68.78007507324219	208.2235107421875	10.5	311.63575744628906	15
conducted both interviews and focus group discussions.	68.78007507324219	220.0465087890625	10.5	227.5644073486328	15
First, I consulted written sources, which consisted of literature (books,	88.63557434082031	231.8065185546875	10.5	291.8033905029297	15

lems in these various media. Primary sources consisted of papers issued by	68.78005981445312	290.9425048828125	10.5	311.56964111328125	15
the Mbororo themselves, essentially MBOSCUDA documents, which I	68.78005981445312	302.7655029296875	10.5	311.61260986328125	15

led me to several other localities in the West, and more broadly in Noun	68.78005981445312	338.1715087890625	10.5	311.6536560058594	15

Western Cameroon is an area dominated by two ethnic groups: the Bamileke	40.46009826660156	92.80764770507812	10.5	311.7733612060547	21
and Bamun. The Bamileke are grouped into seven divisions (Bamboutos,	40.46009826660156	104.63064575195312	10.5	311.75450134277344	21

one hundred chiefdoms. In those divisions, the density reaches more than	40.46009826660156	128.27664184570312	10.5	311.71351623535156	21

same boundaries as Noun Division, covering an area of 7,687 square kilo-	40.46009826660156	151.85964965820312	10.5	311.72193908691406	21
metres, or 55.35 per cent of the West Region (see Mouiche 2005: chap. 2).	40.46009826660156	163.68264770507812	10.5	311.8237762451172	21
Apart from these two dominant groups, the region’s population is made up	40.46009826660156	175.50564575195312	10.5	311.7072296142578	21
of eight sizeable ethnic minorities that can be grouped into two categories:	40.46009826660156	187.32864379882812	10.5	311.65049743652344	21
The first is made up of ethnic groups previously established and residing in	40.46009826660156	199.15164184570312	10.5	311.73976135253906	21

(or Yabassi); in the Bamun land we find the Tikar. The second group is	40.460105895996094	222.79763793945312	10.5	311.73343658447266	21
formed out of “late-comers”, groups that arrived even after the Europeans:	40.460105895996094	234.55764770507812	10.5	311.7743911743164	21

In Cameroon, the relationship between the government and pastoralists is	40.46009826660156	303.7880554199219	10.5	311.69773864746094	23
almost always characterised by – mostly failing – settlement policies. Among	40.46009826660156	315.6110534667969	10.5	311.7681121826172	23
the exceptions is the case of the Mbororo who inhabit the West Region. The	40.46009826660156	327.4340515136719	10.5	311.6473846435547	23
high plateaus and wet vegetation dominated by grasslands are quite suitable	40.46009826660156	339.2570495605469	10.5	311.71876525878906	23

chored itself at its wintering site and adopted a transhumance practice, the	40.46009826660156	362.9030456542969	10.5	311.6063995361328	23

How did the Mbororo become sedentary? Among the geographical features	40.46009826660156	386.5490417480469	10.5	311.59169006347656	23
that made the lifestyle transition at all possible, the altitude seems to play the	40.46009826660156	398.30902099609375	10.5	311.63478088378906	23
most important role: The wintering sites are frequently above 1,500 meters,	40.46009826660156	410.13201904296875	10.5	311.65260314941406	23
an altitudinal threshold that changes the cultural conditions. The settlement	40.46009826660156	421.95501708984375	10.5	311.67787170410156	23
was also the result of an authoritative policy of the administration associated	40.46009826660156	433.77801513671875	10.5	311.5979766845703	23

Though the natural features of the West Region are very suitable for	88.64019775390625	54.5875244140625	10.5	291.84539794921875	29
cattle breeding, the socio-political context is disadvantageous for the	68.78469848632812	66.4105224609375	10.5	311.71246337890625	29
Mbororo. Indeed, farmers exert an unchallenged supremacy over breeders.	68.78469848632812	78.2335205078125	10.5	311.8185119628906	29
This is first of all due to a numerical supremacy but also a political suprem-	68.78469848632812	90.0565185546875	10.5	311.79541015625	29
acy in the broadest sense. Most of the West, particularly the Bamileke Plat-	68.78469848632812	101.8795166015625	10.5	311.7418518066406	29
eau, is more or less reserved for farmers whose settlements have population	68.78469848632812	113.7025146484375	10.5	311.784912109375	29
densities of 200 to 300 inhabitants (or more) per square kilometre. The	68.78469848632812	125.5255126953125	10.5	311.79119873046875	29
result is that land for cattle grazing comprises less than 10 per cent of the	68.78469848632812	137.2855224609375	10.5	311.7723083496094	29
area of the country. Land saturation and the increase of cultivated areas have	68.78469848632812	149.1085205078125	10.5	311.62744140625	29
prevented the expansion of livestock. There are few areas left for breeding	68.78469848632812	160.9315185546875	10.5	311.5644226074219	29
in Bana, the Bamboutos Mountains and the Galim area. Pastures in the	68.78469848632812	172.7545166015625	10.5	311.7555847167969	29
Bamboutos Mountains are considered the largest and richest in Bamileke	68.78469848632812	184.5775146484375	10.5	311.5916748046875	29
country, one reason the colonial authorities reserved their exclusive use for	68.78469848632812	196.4005126953125	10.5	311.63897705078125	29
European cattle breeders (see Champaud 1983: 321; Fark-Grüninger 1995:	68.78469848632812	208.2235107421875	10.5	311.8342590332031	29
111). The population density in rural Bamun is much lower, ranging be-	68.78468322753906	220.0465087890625	10.5	311.8667755126953	29
tween 20 to 40 people per square kilometre. However, this occupancy rate is	68.78468322753906	231.8065185546875	10.5	311.62318420410156	29
hardly suitable for extensive livestock farming. But as the cultivation areas	68.78468322753906	243.6295166015625	10.5	311.6000518798828	29
are not equally distributed, some open lands remain available to pastoralists.	68.78468322753906	255.4525146484375	10.5	311.70933532714844	29
It is due to the advantages of this region of Bamun that the Mbororo have	68.78468322753906	267.2755126953125	10.5	311.58961486816406	29

The difficulties of the Mbororo are related not only to their minority	88.64018249511719	290.9425048828125	10.5	291.76768493652344	29
status but also to the recentness of their settling, to which the “native”	68.78468322753906	302.7655029296875	10.5	311.8185272216797	29
farmers have reacted negatively. Here it may be useful to pose a few simple	68.78468322753906	314.5885009765625	10.5	311.5559844970703	29
questions: Are the Mbororo regarded in the West (by the Bamileke, Bamun,	68.78468322753906	326.3485107421875	10.5	311.6273956298828	29
Mbo, Tikar, farmers, etc.) as autochthons? Do they enjoy full citizenship	68.78468322753906	338.1715087890625	10.5	311.5433807373047	29

eroon? Let us start with a related reflection: The situation in the West Re-	68.78468322753906	361.8175048828125	10.5	311.73133850097656	29
gion is broadly comparable to that of the neighbouring English-speaking	68.78468322753906	373.6405029296875	10.5	311.82691955566406	29
Northwest Region, which is better studied (see Duni et al. 2009; Pelican	68.78468322753906	385.4635009765625	10.5	311.70301818847656	29
2008: 540-560; Boutrais 1984: 225-256). Indeed, there is no documented,	68.78468322753906	397.2864990234375	10.5	311.63893127441406	29
historical, pre-colonial continuity of the Mbororo in any part of today’s	68.78468322753906	409.1094970703125	10.5	311.62525939941406	29
West and Northwest Regions of Cameroon. As pastoralists, they have never	68.78468322753906	420.8695068359375	10.5	311.6347198486328	29
considered buying and thus owning their grazing lands, so in the absence of	68.78468322753906	432.6925048828125	10.5	311.69041442871094	29
territoriality they are considered “migrants” – and in a more negative sense	68.78468322753906	444.5155029296875	10.5	311.76075744628906	29
they are considered “strangers” by neighbouring farmers, who see them-	68.78468322753906	456.3385009765625	10.5	311.7786102294922	29
selves as “landowners” and the Mbororo as their “guests” (see Pelican 2008:	68.78468322753906	468.1614990234375	10.5	311.67149353027344	29
540-560). To put it simply, the contrasts between the two groups are strong:	68.78468322753906	479.9844970703125	10.5	311.8352813720703	29
The farmers are subsumed under the broader Bantu culture, while the	68.78468322753906	491.8074951171875	10.5	311.78700256347656	29

Mbororo society is not centralised but rather built on the basis of small clan	68.78610229492188	290.89202880859375	10.5	311.6147766113281	41

We have explored the Western Mbororo’s ethnographic and socio-political	40.46009826660156	92.80764770507812	10.5	311.7681121826172	101

problem of “political participation” – which, in describing the hierarchy of	40.45361328125	317.3188171386719	10.5	311.6610107421875	101

engaging in political discussions does not involve any participation in the	40.45361328125	388.1938171386719	10.5	311.6326599121094	101

In 1995, the administration was also making use of its cunning. In the	60.31559753417969	172.7545166015625	10.5	291.7173309326172	112

was not fortuitous. Because as village chief he would become an auxiliary of	40.4600830078125	220.0465087890625	10.5	311.6263732910156	112

We will now explore the factors that ensured the socio-political mutation of	68.78009796142578	330.9681396484375	10.5	311.7870407104492	150

– a new Mbororo social movement established in 1992 that works toward	68.78009033203125	378.2601318359375	10.5	311.8657531738281	150
the socio-political integration of this community; and finally, the structural	68.78009033203125	390.0831298828125	10.5	311.6683654785156	150

the absolute law of the majority tends to impair; with the principle of “equal	68.78009033203125	460.9581298828125	10.5	311.5980224609375	150

In the case we are concerned with, and according to the Mbororo	88.63560485839844	101.8795166015625	10.5	291.7204132080078	159
themselves, the MBOSCUDA has done much through its awareness-raising	68.78010559082031	113.7025146484375	10.5	311.78700256347656	159
activities to further the population’s appropriation of their civil and political	68.78010559082031	125.5255126953125	10.5	311.61903381347656	159
rights (see Davis 1995: 225 ff.; Pelican 2008: 540-560). Reportedly, the	68.78010559082031	137.2855224609375	10.5	311.7617950439453	159
MBOSCUDA was particularly helpful in assisting the Mbororo psychologi-	68.78010559082031	149.1085205078125	10.5	311.6747589111328	159
cally. The name “Mbororo” is now accepted and internalised by the	68.78010559082031	160.9315185546875	10.5	311.78697204589844	159
Mbororo themselves whereas before, the term was a pejorative, a source of	68.78010559082031	172.7545166015625	10.5	311.6074676513672	159
frustration, and therefore rejected. The Mbororo previously preferred to be	68.78010559082031	184.5775146484375	10.5	311.6095428466797	159
called Fulani or Fula. The MBOSCUDA also helped to advance education	68.78010559082031	196.4005126953125	10.5	311.5696563720703	159
among the Mbororo. During the phase of awareness-raising, the	68.78010559082031	208.2235107421875	10.5	311.78175354003906	159
MBOSCUDA went everywhere: the hamlets, villages, neighbourhoods, etc.	68.78010559082031	220.0465087890625	10.5	311.6462860107422	159
All occasions were good opportunities to revamp Mbororo self-esteem: a	68.78009033203125	231.8065185546875	10.5	311.81640625	159
festive occasion anywhere, or a meeting in a cattle market – in short, wher-	68.78009033203125	243.6295166015625	10.5	311.7523498535156	159
ever the Mbororo could come together. The MBOSCUDA also relied on	68.78009033203125	255.4525146484375	10.5	311.6106262207031	159
the help and networks of the ardos. The MBOSCUDA urged the Mbororo to	68.78009033203125	267.2755126953125	10.535614013671875	311.6820068359375	159

obtain birth and marriage certificates – in short, they were taught their civil	68.78009796142578	290.9425048828125	10.5	311.7386703491211	159
and political rights and all that is inherent in human rights. The	68.78009033203125	302.7655029296875	10.5	311.6368103027344	159
MBOSCUDA has also provided the Mbororo with legal assistance. This	68.78009033203125	314.5885009765625	10.5	311.60430908203125	159
assistance is very salutary; previously when threatened with a lawsuit, a	68.78009033203125	326.3485107421875	10.5	311.7744140625	159
Mbororo would be so alarmed that s/he would risk all her/his assets to	68.78009033203125	338.1715087890625	10.5	311.57391357421875	159
avoid losing the trial and her/his honour, but now the way of thinking has	68.78009033203125	349.9945068359375	10.5	311.64105224609375	159
changed. The MBOSCUDA also asked them to settle, to modernise stock	68.78009033203125	361.8175048828125	10.5	311.62322998046875	159
farming and to acquire land deeds in order to avoid being at the mercy of	68.78009033203125	373.6405029296875	10.5	311.673583984375	159
the other farmers, who sometimes produce deeds issued after the settlement	68.78009033203125	385.4635009765625	10.5	311.60430908203125	159
of the Mbororo. The MBOSCUDA provides teaching materials, desks and	68.78009033203125	397.2864990234375	10.5	311.5916748046875	159

sary items. Finally, the MBOSCUDA promotes a better recognition of the	68.78009033203125	420.8695068359375	10.5	311.6126708984375	159
Mbororo, in order that they achieve greater visibility and are able to actively	68.78009033203125	432.6925048828125	10.5	311.57489013671875	159

The MBOSCUDA thus remains confined to an awareness-raising role	88.63558959960938	468.1614990234375	10.5	291.88739013671875	159

However, the MBOSCUDA is still dominated by bureaucratic elites established in	88.67189025878906	528.8524169921875	8.999996185302734	291.93836975097656	161

promoted the Mbororo as an “indigenous minority” whose cultural	60.32011413574219	255.73849487304688	10.019989013671875	272.11915588378906	165

As we can see, the perspective of resource mobilisation not only affects	40.46009826660156	306.7880554199219	10.5	311.5895538330078	166

ered rational behaviour just like any other institutional behaviour. In this	40.46009826660156	377.7260437011719	10.5	311.6609649658203	166
regard, it adopts the opposite point of view to that of the classical model,	40.46009826660156	389.5490417480469	10.5	311.64735412597656	166
which considers social movements the effects of failure or malfunction of	40.46009826660156	401.30902099609375	10.5	311.69041442871094	166
the social system. The view adopted here is, on the contrary, based on the	40.46009826660156	413.13201904296875	10.5	311.7975311279297	166

the latter being manifested in electoral votes that they either get or expect to	68.78010559082031	90.0565185546875	10.5	311.59483337402344	169

In addition, we have shown above that Mbororo society is not welded	88.6356201171875	255.4525146484375	10.5	291.74249267578125	178

Cameroon – and he called himself lamido, thereby the paramount chief of	68.78009033203125	338.1715087890625	10.5	311.6526184082031	178
the ardos. Even though the undertaking was received favourably in Didango,	68.78009033203125	349.9945068359375	10.53564453125	311.67144775390625	178
clan individualism still had too thick a skin among the ardos and the	68.78009033203125	361.8175048828125	10.53564453125	311.7870178222656	178
Mbororo of other camps for all to acknowledge him. Besides, for such a	68.78009033203125	373.6405029296875	10.5	311.5076904296875	178
project to be truly successful, it would need the concomitant endorsement	68.78009033203125	385.4635009765625	10.5	311.6694030761719	178
of the administration and the sultan of Bamum. However, Dairou, as a	68.78009033203125	397.2864990234375	10.5	311.6263427734375	178

petes with that of the sultan of Bamum, which in the socio-political context	68.78009033203125	420.8695068359375	10.5	311.7544860839844	178
of the Bamun kingdom is unacceptable. Yerima Dairou’s father initially	68.78009033203125	432.6925048828125	10.5	311.5738830566406	178
attempted to get acknowledged by the colonial administration as lamido	68.78009796142578	444.5155029296875	10.5	311.5822982788086	178
(1915–1962), but he gave that pursuit up following independence. Among	68.78009796142578	456.3385009765625	10.5	311.66097259521484	178
other reasons, his decision was borne out of consideration, as no-one in the	68.78009796142578	468.1614990234375	10.5	311.76183319091797	178
kingdom of Bamun should have a power similar to that of the sultan (see	68.78010559082031	479.9844970703125	10.5	311.62742614746094	178
Salé 1991). In fact, the so-called “lamidate” of Didango confers only the	68.78010559082031	491.8074951171875	10.5	311.6903839111328	178

to Didango. Nevertheless, it represents an important reference point in the	68.78010559082031	515.3905029296875	10.5	311.6841278076172	178

We have just seen that, as long as elections within the one-party system	68.78009796142578	76.72760009765625	10.500030517578125	311.78279876708984	187

cond, the role of the MBOSCUDA, a new social movement of the Mbororo	68.78012084960938	265.7696228027344	10.5	311.7723388671875	187

It remains a fact, however, that the Mbororo in the West – as in the	88.6356201171875	395.71759033203125	10.5	291.93255615234375	187

therefore constitutional democracy is still struggling to truly penetrate the	40.46009826660156	54.5875244140625	10.5	311.6358184814453	190
political field in Cameroon. That is why among their grievances, the	40.46009826660156	66.4105224609375	10.5	311.69252014160156	190
Mbororo voice repeatedly that they want to have a member of their com-	40.46009826660156	78.2335205078125	10.5	311.7061004638672	190

sembly. The same would hold true for the senate and regional assemblies –	40.46009826660156	101.8795166015625	10.5	311.7072296142578	190
both institutions are stipulated in the constitution but have yet to be created.	40.46009826660156	113.7025146484375	10.5	311.61167907714844	190
The Mbororo are also advancing their demands to have local councillors	40.46009826660156	125.5255126953125	10.5	311.70301818847656	190
and mayors, arguing that they have the necessary “qualifications”. Finally,	40.46009826660156	137.2855224609375	10.5	311.8342742919922	190
there is no space to discuss the role of the arena (regional or national) for	40.46009826660156	149.1085205078125	10.5	311.5696258544922	190

interests of the group, or simply boil down to an individual’s ambitions. This	40.46009826660156	196.4005126953125	10.5	311.71665954589844	190
