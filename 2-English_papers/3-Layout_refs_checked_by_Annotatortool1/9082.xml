Abstract: The following paper is about artists doing experimental and performative art who expect	144.6999969482422	166.6925048828125	9.247314453125	391.8009796142578	5
the spectators to become participants in the process of artwork production. The artwork is thus pro-	144.6999969482422	180.79248046875	9.0	396.79701232910156	5
duced through a process of participation. As a researcher, I was similarly expected to participate in	144.6999969482422	194.99249267578125	9.0	394.79518127441406	5
the artwork process. As I observed, the artists worked at having their agency in the artwork process	144.6999969482422	209.092529296875	9.0	397.3040313720703	5
recognized by the participating spectators. At the same time, the artists create a certain proximity to	144.6999969482422	223.29248046875	9.0	398.29005432128906	5
the spectators-participants through performing art, which I call "performing proximity." By involving	144.6999969482422	237.39251708984375	9.0	391.8080596923828	5
the participants in their art-in-process, they make use of their agency to redefine the artworld and	144.6999969482422	251.592529296875	9.0	387.7050323486328	5
enlarge it into other social worlds. I also discuss how artists' ability to enact redefined social worlds	144.6999969482422	265.6925048828125	9.0	394.0000762939453	5
can be compared to agency in performative social science and in biographical research.	144.6999969482422	279.89251708984375	9.0	352.29310607910156	5

Everett HUGHES developed a strategy for his students to learn to "fly on their	144.6999969482422	564.0797119140625	11.0	379.03102111816406	19
own" in their field of research1 (PUNCH, 1998). This refers to an artwork by	144.6999969482422	577.55908203125	11.620620727539062	366.36302185058594	19
Serbian artist Tomislav VUKIC, who found a ventilator without blades in the	144.6999969482422	592.3796997070312	11.0	366.43104553222656	19
street. He turned it into an object of art and called his work "learning to fly," a title	144.6999969482422	606.479736328125	11.0	394.6040802001953	19
inspired by the song "Learning to Fly"2 by Pink Floyd. Learning to fly can be read	144.6999969482422	620.05908203125	11.62060546875	392.39002990722656	19

enigmatic to him as his own existence as an artist, and his artistic development;	144.6999969482422	648.979736328125	11.0	388.2470245361328	19
that is, his ability to be an artist without "crashing". Only the title "Learning to fly"	144.6999969482422	663.0797119140625	11.0	389.69398498535156	19

public sphere. In interview settings with artists, I accept how they communicate	144.6999969482422	421.47967529296875	11.0	384.37904357910156	26
their own reality and how they narrate auto-biographical material. It is meaningful	144.6999969482422	435.5796813964844	11.0	394.3579864501953	26
how they invent their realities and how these take on their own meanings.	144.6999969482422	449.7796936035156	11.0	357.92100524902344	26
Increasingly, artists themselves are anticipating sociologists in finding ways into	144.6999969482422	463.87969970703125	11.0	387.56800842285156	26
social worlds and preparing social worlds for the sociologists. In my view, these	144.6999969482422	478.0796813964844	11.0	386.1951446533203	26
procedures of doing art-in-process present new challenges to the methods	144.6999969482422	492.1796875	11.0	363.3999786376953	26
employed in order to understand artistic practices. Based on preliminary	144.6999969482422	506.37969970703125	11.0	350.8999786376953	26

experience, this article discusses the interrelationship between artistic production	144.6999969482422	534.6796875	11.0	394.7210235595703	26
and performative social science. I present two examples "Lawrence" and "Micky,"	144.6999969482422	548.7796630859375	11.0	396.2940216064453	26
and discuss how aspects of biographical work can be connected with processual	144.6999969482422	562.9796752929688	11.0	392.93202209472656	26
structures of performative artistic practices. Proximity in the working alliance with	144.6999969482422	577.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	393.49403381347656	26
artists gives the chance to reflect performative aspects in these practices of doing	144.6999969482422	591.2797241210938	11.0	398.4160919189453	26
art and shows that reflections of approximation in performances are as important	144.6999969482422	605.3796997070312	11.0	393.7260284423828	26
as the articulation of the artist's autonomous position. I see these approaches in	144.6999969482422	619.5797119140625	11.0	389.8050079345703	26
performative research with artists as comparable with techniques within	144.6999969482422	633.6796875	11.0	348.45201110839844	26
performative social science. [2]	144.6999969482422	647.8796997070312	11.0	151.54701232910156	26
Within the framework of the generative contexts of artistic works, the artist	144.6999969482422	676.1796875	11.0	362.11500549316406	27
undertakes the performative assertion and determination of a work in its fragility,	144.6999969482422	690.2797241210938	11.0	392.04701232910156	27
because art works are performative themselves. Artists justify their work while	144.6999969482422	704.479736328125	11.0	379.6050567626953	27
they conceptualize it or if they install a work in a public space, they deliberate and	144.6999969482422	718.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	397.19508361816406	27
explain their concept and this is part of the process of doing art. These	144.6999969482422	732.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	344.34803771972656	27
justifications are more powerful today, as we have entered a process of	144.6999969482422	746.8796997070312	11.0	348.0630340576172	27
permanent democratization and deliberation. Furthermore, these justifications	144.6999969482422	761.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	378.7000274658203	27

observer. The fragility of language in the constitution of art works ought to be	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	375.34205627441406	30
acknowledged,3 as ADORNO (1997) framed the ethical and humanizing attitude	144.6999969482422	135.859130859375	11.62054443359375	389.39405822753906	30
he demanded from modernism's discourse on art, so to should the artistic agent's	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	397.58998107910156	30
role also be acknowledged. For example, what artists actually do through their	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	380.83094787597656	30
arts practice plays a role in academic and critical discourses, because those	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	370.94203186035156	30
artists are the agents in the process of creating artworks. [3]	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	293.64698791503906	30
What, then, do artists produce, and how is this related to performative social	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	372.06300354003906	31
science? How is this question related to the manner in which sociological and	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	377.04811096191406	31

interrelation between art and science? In the next section I will elaborate the role	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	392.36305236816406	31
of performativity in both art and science. [4]	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	211.44700622558594	31

Art and science have been seen as two different domains, apparently facing each	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	397.7949981689453	33
other in an opposition that has become obsolete. Similarly, conventional dualisms	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	397.04200744628906	33
such as private vs. public no longer apply to the dynamic acts of artists when the	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	392.62599182128906	33
latter present installation work and actions in exhibition spaces that invert life-	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	377.0570831298828	33
worlds. Artists react to changed aesthetic experiences and reflect environments	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	387.8000030517578	33
and landscapes of knowledge in their work. In MERSCH's view, art proves a "way	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	397.7520294189453	33

does an artwork produce? How does it situate a viewer? What values,	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	341.18394470214844	42
conventions, ideologies and meanings are inscribed in this situation?" (2007a,	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	379.79005432128906	42

to better understand the performative aspects of art, we must look at artists'	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	369.2520294189453	42
practices. It is in the doing that the performative is revealed. The context of	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	365.01002502441406	42

In order to understand what art is, aesthetic theories have been developed that	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	384.57301330566406	53

shift, seen by REBENTISCH, not as a radical renunciation of modern categories	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	390.43702697753906	53

art, as it were, challenges philosophy to revise this central category of its discourse,	167.39999389648438	406.0361022949219	10.0	366.5200500488281	55

that art works are constitutively processual. This processuality is constitutively	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0162353515625	379.57801818847656	62

The interview with Lawrence6, a 24-year old artist from England, was conducted	144.6999969482422	192.4591064453125	11.62060546875	388.44300842285156	73

course of an hour, in one minute, as though in time-lapse. During the interview,	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	385.84693908691406	73
descriptions and argumentation predominated. Based on the description, an	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	370.8319854736328	73

is the fragility of it. For example, the project, it is very delicate and fragile now if I	167.39999389648438	604.1361083984375	10.0	351.6700744628906	86

A difference10 is moreover being produced that cannot be understood simply as	144.6999969482422	107.55914306640625	11.62054443359375	386.3631134033203	90
activity. In this difference, the presence of the work is manifest. Lawrence	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	358.31602478027344	90

In the following section of the interview, Lawrence begins to ponder the	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	346.62596130371094	91
conditions of the constitution of his own work—to survey them.	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	304.83604431152344	91
"And if you bump into me in a train station or in a bus or strolling through a gallery	167.39999389648438	222.1361083984375	10.0	358.0899353027344	92
and I perform a story ... there is always a framework, the framework is the bus or the	167.39999389648438	236.236083984375	10.0	371.6600646972656	92
framework is the gallery, but the point is the framework does not make a specific kind	167.39999389648438	250.43609619140625	10.0	375.2601623535156	92
of relationship to my biography, it doesn't say 'on the bus between these hours'.	167.39999389648438	264.53607177734375	10.0	348.8000183105469	92

An institutional framework such as a radio broadcasting studio can destroy the	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	381.82606506347656	93
situation of narration, one that is for him very fragile and intimate, because the	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	381.1790313720703	93
narrator is identified with his biographical data. The performative act of the work	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	388.8000030517578	93
can be destroyed because the reciprocity and the direction of the narration	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	363.24205017089844	93
toward a listener is absent, even as listeners are present. The rhetorical assertion	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	397.56300354003906	93
of narrative thus vitiates the narrator's disposition. [27]	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	264.3470001220703	93
In the radio situation, Lawrence experiences the disappearance of his own	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	362.42604064941406	94
presence as an artist. His explanation for this disappearance resembles the	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	368.1260528564453	94
situation he experienced during his studies when he sought to overcome the	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	371.62599182128906	94

projector. The reflection on his presence, as he reclaims the latter, is part of his	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	386.9049835205078	94

unclear; Lawrence refused to make the broadcast available for download from the	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	399.1790313720703	96

produced as part of an exhibition. Lawrence apprehension was that his	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	345.2050018310547	96
performance could become liable to exploitation by the culture industry11. On the	144.6999969482422	687.6590576171875	11.62066650390625	390.92604064941406	96

her/his own star. In the radio studio, they felt and behaved like stars. Some had	144.6999969482422	505.7796630859375	11.0	386.89503479003906	105

talk with him about his performances. His work is related to the political situation	144.6999969482422	757.8796997070312	11.0	390.28907775878906	113

performances.13 He studied Sociology in the 1990s in South Africa, when he	144.6999969482422	107.55914306640625	11.62054443359375	370.1790313720703	116
started walking. "I used to go on walks in the early 1990s I used to go for like four	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	396.88905334472656	116
days, wake up in the middle of the night and then go for a walk, you know, out	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	380.32606506347656	116
into the bush, out of the town and that was a few times when I used to write	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	367.7670440673828	116
poetry about my experience, the homeless people I would meet, I gave like one	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	386.99501037597656	116
man on the street everything I had, you know, a jacket, everything" (Micky, 2008,	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	394.3579864501953	116
II.139-141). After he came to Germany, Micky tried to sort out his position in the	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	389.0260772705078	116
world by defining "who" he was. It was when he went to a drawing course that he	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	393.97901916503906	116
realized his need for this "definition." For example, it was through his art practice	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	392.0470733642578	116
that he could connect his first performances as an artistic practice:	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	323.7939910888672	116
"... and today, knowing more, I realized that this could be interpreted as performance	167.39999389648438	264.53607177734375	10.0	371.5599670410156	117
of course, I didn't see the connection I think that I mean I don't want to put too much	167.39999389648438	278.736083984375	10.0	368.4499816894531	117
focus on the walks because they weren't very many of them and this is just an	167.39999389648438	292.83612060546875	10.0	342.3599853515625	117
example for my first kind of what I would now think about my artistic entrance	167.39999389648438	307.03607177734375	10.0	338.5600891113281	117

A performance for Micky allows him to test his own boundaries. Thus, he is	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	365.7679901123047	118
asking the public for 10 seconds of their time, to perform. "How much do I need	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	387.3640899658203	118
and of course how much space do I need but the focal one it was me" (Micky,	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	378.5470733642578	118

Importantly, Micky realized that it was through artistic expression as performance	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	395.0159454345703	119
that he could transform himself. At the same time, Micky also realized what art is	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	393.08900451660156	119
for him: "... a personal transformation which automatically becomes a social	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	368.8159942626953	119
transformation" (ibid. II.187). He is now doing performances as his main genre of	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	394.3100128173828	119
work; this is because it is possible in a performance to create mirrors for the	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	370.02601623535156	119
participants. Very important for the notion of proximity is that someone has to	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	375.91004943847656	119
come to him, he is waiting; this is automatically reflected in that observers of his	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	388.70497131347656	119
performance are part of the performance and he is reflecting whether they need it	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	397.9359893798828	119
or not: "if I place myself in the public a social need is there, it will be addressed by	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	398.66297912597656	119
the person who comes to me, otherwise they wouldn't come to me" (Micky, 2008,	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	395.45802307128906	119
II.226-227). Micky realized in doing performances that he is positioned in and	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	376.10011291503906	119
possibly positioned against the art world. For example, he felt increasingly bored	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	391.77406311035156	119
seeing the same kinds of exhibitions. For him, art has many functions and he	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	375.37904357910156	119
rejects being another artist who is over intellectualizing art works while ignoring	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	384.9370880126953	119
the transformational power of performative art. "For me to create something I	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	375.5940704345703	119

greeting your neighbor" (Micky, 2008, II.268-270). The artwork is for Micky the	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	381.22608947753906	119
moment one person has with him: "May be it is 20 seconds or it is ... and then it is	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	398.62501525878906	119

goes, it is a kind of a social rhythm it is a kind of a rhythm" (Micky, 2008, II.281-	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	386.8991241455078	119

The question of participation is a consequence of a changed understanding of the	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	399.17909240722656	123

the mode of narrative is performatively used to establish a communicative	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	359.6580047607422	131
situation involving the listener-viewer that is open to subsequent communication.	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	392.1680450439453	131
This process does not resolve into an act of interpretation, but into participation in	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	397.40504455566406	131
his performance. Micky justifies his role as a performer in creating a space for the	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	397.82606506347656	131
autonomy of his artistic position. For both Lawrence and Micky, the approximation	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	398.51612854003906	131
to the performance and how the audience is coming to it could be destroyed if	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	379.4359893798828	131
there is too much proximity or too much intellectualization about what they are	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	380.0420684814453	131
doing as well as through over-interpretation of their works. A rupture would then	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	388.5420684814453	131
destroy the relation to simple everyday interactions and understanding of art. In	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	386.61000061035156	131
this direction, definitions of art could learn to fly. [38]	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	254.54701232910156	131
What does the artistic interaction with one's own biography and understanding of	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	393.91004943847656	132
performative art show? The power of art to resist an analytic approach; a power	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	388.1000518798828	132
that consists in breaking open the frameworks of research, and thus securing the	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	395.5790557861328	132
autonomy of a work that is not at anyone's disposal. With respect to the	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	348.98899841308594	132
intersection between biographical research, interpretive social science, and	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	366.4950408935547	132
philosophical aesthetics, "learning to fly" means adopting a perspective such as	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	387.7160186767578	132
that developed in performative social science so that conversations with artists	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	382.3620147705078	132
can begin. I see here one precondition for a more substantial working alliance	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	378.93702697753906	132
with artists that, rather than limiting itself to cultural-industrial critique, seeks to	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	381.7100372314453	132
understand social change explained by artists. [39]	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	247.7469940185547	132
