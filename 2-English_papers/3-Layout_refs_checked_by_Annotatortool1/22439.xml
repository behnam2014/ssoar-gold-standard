In Europe and the United States, health issues and medical science receive a lot of attention on	47.55509948730469	434.3711242675781	10.0	385.8779754638672	7
television compared to that devoted to other sciences (Göpfert, 1996; Lafollette, 2002;	47.55509948730469	446.3711242675781	10.0	385.8910369873047	7
Cheveigné, 2006). Of all the sciences, the European public is also most interested in medicine, and	47.55509948730469	458.3711242675781	10.0	385.88194274902344	7
they use television as their main source of information on science (European Commission, 2001). As	47.55509948730469	470.3711242675781	10.0	385.88389587402344	7
television plays such an important role in the way the public gathers information, it would seem to	47.55509948730469	482.3711242675781	10.0	385.92604064941406	7
be important to know how science is represented there, especially since the public debate is drawing	47.55509948730469	494.3711242675781	10.0	385.8879852294922	7
attention to the increasing tension between the dumbing-down of media content and the increasing	47.55509948730469	506.37109375	10.0	385.8739776611328	7
complexity of science and daily life (cf. Dawkins, 1998; Hargreaves and Ferguson, 2001). The	47.55509948730469	518.37109375	10.0	385.8769989013672	7
debate suggests that media content has changed over the years. Has media content relating to science	47.55509948730469	530.37109375	10.0	385.88499450683594	7
changed over time, or is the suggestion based more on myths about media content and the power of	47.55509948730469	542.37109375	10.0	385.8599090576172	7
the media (Schönbach, 2000) than on empirical reality?	47.55509948730469	554.3711547851562	10.000007629394531	215.92298889160156	7
There has been hardly any empirical research into the historical development of television	65.55509948730469	566.3711547851562	10.0	367.88096618652344	7
content and science (Dawkins, 1998; Loughlin, 2000; Allan, 2002). A study was therefore con-	47.55509948730469	578.3711547851562	10.0	385.8710174560547	7

and if so, how. This study was carried out against the background of the above-mentioned public	47.55509948730469	602.3711547851562	10.0	385.9429168701172	7

In some social theoretical perspectives, the development of the media is presented as the	72.55509948730469	58.6424560546875	10.0	353.99598693847656	11

related to the development of science and technology. Thompson calls the development of the	54.55509948730469	82.6424560546875	10.0	371.99000549316406	11
media the “mediazation of culture,” by which patterns of communication and interaction have	54.55509948730469	94.6424560546875	10.0	372.01100158691406	11
changed in “profound and irreversible ways” (1995: 46). By now, mediazation also includes	54.55509948730469	106.6424560546875	10.0	371.98597717285156	11
the rise of “media logic” (Altheide and Snow, 1979, 1991; van Vree et al., 2003), in which the	54.55509948730469	118.6424560546875	10.0	371.9950408935547	11

information is presented. The concept of mediazation was used as a background in this study	54.55509948730469	142.6424560546875	10.0	371.9869842529297	11

Mediazation was chosen instead of mediatization because mediazation refers primary to cul-	54.55509948730469	166.6424560546875	10.019287109375	372.00401306152344	11
tural processes and mediatization seems to become more and more defined as a concept used	54.55509948730469	178.64242553710938	10.019317626953125	371.99400329589844	11

nizations in society (Kepplinger, 2002; Schulz, 2004; Schrott, 2005). This mediatization is not	54.554107666015625	202.64242553710938	10.019317626953125	371.9989929199219	11
the focus of this study.	54.5531005859375	214.64242553710938	10.0	91.15800476074219	11

In this media analysis, medicine is taken as exemplary of the development of the representation	54.5531005859375	262.6424255371094	10.0	372.00396728515625	13
of science on television over time. This is for several reasons. First, because of its presence	54.5531005859375	274.6424255371094	10.0	371.9940185546875	13
in the media, the importance the public attaches to it and the image medical science has as	54.5531005859375	286.6424255371094	10.0	371.9940490722656	13
being exemplary of science in general. Inhabitants of the European Union also think that med-	54.5531005859375	298.6424255371094	10.0	372.0021057128906	13
ical science is the most scientific compared to other sciences (European Commission, 2001).	54.5531005859375	310.6424255371094	10.0	371.9920959472656	13
This confirms earlier research conducted in the United Kingdom (Durant et al., 1992) and	54.5531005859375	322.6424255371094	10.0	371.99005126953125	13
Canada (Einsiedel, 1992) that showed that medicine dominates the general image the public	54.5531005859375	334.6424255371094	10.0	371.9860534667969	13
has of science. This suggests that at least for a part of the public, medicine is paradigmatic for	54.5531005859375	346.6424255371094	10.0	371.9970397949219	13
science in general. The image of science in general is determined by the familiarity with and	54.5531005859375	358.6424255371094	10.0	371.9990234375	13
the image of medical science. As Einsiedel (1992) has said, a typical story about science is a	54.5531005859375	370.6424255371094	10.0	371.9949951171875	13
story about medical science, is based on scientific expertise and is a positive occurrence, often	54.5531005859375	382.6424255371094	10.0	372.0080261230469	13
a medical innovation or a treatment.	54.5531005859375	394.6424255371094	10.0	145.239013671875	13
Second, when measuring the attention devoted to science and technology, medical	72.5531005859375	406.6424255371094	10.0	353.9930114746094	13
journalism can be positioned between general news journalism and science journalism. On the	54.5531005859375	418.6424255371094	10.0	371.9849548339844	13
general television news, not much attention is paid to science or technology (León, 2004). In	54.553096771240234	430.6424255371094	10.0	371.9730567932129	13
special science programs on television as a part of science journalism the situation is the oppo-	54.553096771240234	442.6424255371094	10.0	371.9859962463379	13
site: science and technology are very visible because the broadcasts usually are entirely devoted	54.553096771240234	454.6424255371094	10.0	371.9940528869629	13
to science. It can be expected that medical journalism will be positioned somewhere in between.	54.553096771240234	466.6424255371094	10.0	371.986026763916	13
The above considerations seem to make medical journalism suitable for observing	72.5531005859375	478.6424255371094	10.0	353.989013671875	13

The background to the study was the theoretical debate on and arguments concerning the	54.5531005859375	550.6424560546875	10.000007629394531	371.9870300292969	15
scientification and mediazation of culture and society. If we look at the development of	54.5531005859375	562.6424560546875	10.0	371.9930114746094	15
science we find it has determined not only the technological processes, economic systems and	54.5531005859375	574.6424560546875	10.0	371.9940185546875	15
social structures of society but also our everyday experience of the world and conscious	54.5531005859375	586.6424560546875	10.0	371.989990234375	15
thoughts and even unconscious feelings. It is presented as the driving force behind modern-	54.5531005859375	598.6424560546875	10.0	371.9830017089844	15

tion” and “socialization” have led to a science and society that are fundamentally interwoven	54.5531005859375	622.6424560546875	9.999996185302734	371.9960021972656	15
(cf. Hagendijk, 1996, 2004) and the co-production of a scientificized culture.	54.5531005859375	634.6424560546875	9.999996185302734	309.94000244140625	15

If we look at the development of the mass media, we find a great deal of attention has	73.55509948730469	58.6422119140625	10.0	353.9860076904297	17
been devoted to the role and logic of the media and to the “mediazation of culture”	55.55509948730469	70.6422119140625	10.0	371.9980010986328	17
(Thompson, 1995: 46). This has resulted in the transformation of the public sphere, which	55.55509948730469	82.6422119140625	10.0	371.98606872558594	17
now takes the form more of a mediated publicness than a non-mediated agora for dialogue	55.55509948730469	94.6422119140625	10.0	371.9810333251953	17
and debate. Social and political life has become nothing more than a struggle for visibility in	55.55509948730469	106.6422119140625	10.0	371.98609924316406	17
the mass media. Mediazation has entered upon a new phase in recent decades, referred to as	55.55509948730469	118.6422119140625	10.0	371.9900665283203	17
“extended mediazation” (Thompson, 1995: 110–11): the media have developed a “relatively	55.55509948730469	130.6422119140625	10.0	371.99501037597656	17
high degree of self-referentiality” (Thompson, 1995: 110). Media messages refer more often	55.55509948730469	142.6422119140625	10.0	372.00599670410156	17
to other media messages and to events reported in the media.	55.55509948730469	154.6422119140625	10.0	245.61500549316406	17
“Media logic” is said to have replaced the classical journalistic way of working (Altheide	73.55509948730469	166.6422119140625	9.999969482421875	353.9929962158203	17

sented. They reflect underlying, often implicit rules that apply to the whole media industry,	55.55509948730469	214.64218139648438	10.0	371.9859161376953	17
although there are different formats for different subjects, for example for news, entertainment,	55.55509948730469	226.64218139648438	10.0	372.0180206298828	17
sports and talk shows. They provide the grammar for media content, they arrange actions and	55.55509948730469	238.64218139648438	10.0	371.97901916503906	17
events, provide temporality and produce symbols that express emotion or are meant to evoke	55.55509948730469	250.64218139648438	10.0	371.98597717285156	17
emotions. They are dominated by the “entertainment perspective” (Altheide and Snow, 1979),	55.55509948730469	262.6421813964844	10.0	371.9960174560547	17
aiming at entertaining the public instead of informing them. Information presented in an	55.55509948730469	274.6421813964844	10.0	371.98707580566406	17
entertainment format is sometimes referred to as “infotainment” (Brants, 1998; Wieten, 2002).	55.55509948730469	286.6421813964844	10.0	372.00404357910156	17

Empirical research into the content of news has shown that this development towards media	55.55509948730469	334.6421813964844	10.0	371.98902893066406	19
logic and the self-referentiality of the media started as early as the 1950s. Much research has	55.55509948730469	346.6421813964844	10.0	372.00111389160156	19
shown that media content is consistent and that this content mainly can be explained by the	55.55509948730469	358.6421813964844	10.0	371.98902893066406	19
working of the so-called news values and news factors. Following the classical study by	55.55509948730469	370.6421813964844	10.0	371.9910430908203	19
Galtung and Ruge (1965), many researchers have worked on extending the news value theory.	55.55509948730469	382.6421813964844	10.0	371.99000549316406	19
For example, Schulz (1976, 1982) has shown that the content of the news and its production	55.55509948730469	394.6421813964844	10.0	371.9810028076172	19
are not what one would expect on the basis of the professional norms and ideals of journalists.	55.55509948730469	406.6421813964844	10.0	371.9789276123047	19
Important news factors are:	55.55509948730469	418.6421813964844	10.0	110.06600952148438	19
● Threshold: the news is about topics that exceed a certain threshold of intensity to be	63.55509948730469	442.6421813964844	10.33721923828125	363.9870147705078	20
noticed by journalists.	73.55509948730469	454.6421813964844	10.0	89.08799743652344	20
● Unambiguity: the news often presents matters as unambiguous.	63.55509948730469	466.6421813964844	10.33721923828125	264.75502014160156	20
● Consonance: the news is consonant with what journalists and the public have in their minds.	63.55509948730469	478.6421813964844	10.33721923828125	363.99192810058594	20
● Status: the news is about elite people, nations and institutes.	63.55509948730469	490.6421813964844	10.33721923828125	251.6640167236328	20
● Dynamics: the news presents the world as constantly changing.	63.55509948730469	502.6422119140625	10.337158203125	264.61598205566406	20
● Valence: the news is about success or conflicts.	63.55509948730469	514.6422119140625	10.337158203125	200.3090057373047	20
● Identification: the news often presents people who evoke compassion.	63.55509948730469	526.6422119140625	10.337158203125	291.1780548095703	20
● Personification: the news is about people with whom the public can identify, people in	63.55509948730469	538.6422119140625	10.337158203125	363.9929962158203	20

The historical development of television journalism has also been described as a process	55.55509948730469	598.6422119140625	10.0	371.9870147705078	22
towards the increasing use of media logic. In the 1950s and 1960s, television used models	55.55509948730469	610.6422119140625	10.0	371.9761199951172	22
taken from the movies, followed by one derived from the press until about 1985. From then	55.55509948730469	622.6422119140625	9.999996185302734	371.9879913330078	22
on it started using more and more formats with the characteristics of media logic. Not only	55.55509948730469	634.6422119140625	9.999996185302734	371.98512268066406	22

the rise of commercial television but also technological developments are held responsible for	54.55509948730469	58.6424560546875	10.0	372.0079803466797	24
this (Wijfjes, 2002).	54.55509948730469	70.6424560546875	10.0	80.63499450683594	24
The Netherlands was one of the last countries in Europe to introduce commercial television	72.55509948730469	82.6424560546875	10.0	353.99208068847656	24
(Bakker and Scholten, 2005). Until 1989, Dutch television was public television only. All broad-	54.55509948730469	94.6424560546875	10.0	371.9869842529297	24
casters were non-profit organizations. In 1989, commercial television was introduced parallel to	54.55509948730469	106.6424560546875	10.0	372.0499725341797	24
the public broadcasting system. Today, the Netherlands has three public broadcasting channels	54.55509948730469	118.6424560546875	10.0	371.9800567626953	24
and eight national commercial channels (Bakker and Scholten, 2005)	54.55509948730469	130.6424560546875	10.0	271.6799774169922	24

The question is how the representation of science on television has developed. Has the use of	54.55509948730469	166.642333984375	9.999969482421875	371.99598693847656	25
science—medical science in this case—on television changed during the past decades, and if	54.554107666015625	178.64230346679688	10.0	371.9949951171875	25
so, how? Or, to put it differently, have the narratives and knowledge of journalists taken over	54.554107666015625	190.64230346679688	10.0	371.99298095703125	25
from those of scientists and experts in medical television programs, because of increasing	54.554107666015625	202.64230346679688	10.0	371.9990539550781	25
media logic? The study started out from the mediazation hypothesis, which states that the nar-	54.554107666015625	214.64230346679688	10.0	372.0521240234375	25
ratives and knowledge of journalists have become more present in the media over the years	54.554107666015625	226.64230346679688	10.0	371.9889221191406	25
than those of scientists and experts.	54.554107666015625	238.64230346679688	10.0	142.7160186767578	25

In order to answer the research question, a content analysis of a sample of medical documentaries	54.554107666015625	309.6423034667969	10.0	372.0049743652344	28
from the public broadcasting organizations in the Netherlands was carried out. It was decided	54.554107666015625	321.6423034667969	10.0	371.970947265625	28
to analyze only non-fiction medical television shows, because this genre of medical television	54.554107666015625	333.6423034667969	10.0	372.0000305175781	28
was broadcast throughout almost the entire research period. Although fictional medical tele-	54.554107666015625	345.6423034667969	10.0	371.9909973144531	28
vision programs are also relevant, such programs were not broadcast in the Netherlands until	54.554107666015625	357.6423034667969	10.0	371.989013671875	28
the late 1980s. Furthermore, quite a lot of research on medical drama series has already been	54.554107666015625	369.6423034667969	10.0	371.9859619140625	28
done (e.g. van Dijck, 2002; Kirby, 2003), in contrast to the amount on medical programs with	54.554107666015625	381.6423034667969	10.0	371.9960021972656	28
a predominantly informational character and aim.	54.554107666015625	393.6423034667969	10.0	199.49302673339844	28

It emerged from the archives of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision that from the	54.554107666015625	435.6423034667969	10.0	371.9960021972656	30
start of Dutch television in 1951 until 2000 over 40 different medical series were produced	54.554107666015625	447.6423034667969	10.0	371.9920349121094	30
and broadcast, starting in 1961. This is such a broad and varied universe that a random sam-	54.554107666015625	459.6423034667969	10.0	371.9779968261719	30
ple was not suitable for the study. In order to make the historical analysis as internally valid	54.554107666015625	471.6423034667969	10.0	371.9870300292969	30
as possible, a sampling frame was devised. This sampling frame was made up of a group of	54.554107666015625	483.6423034667969	10.0	371.98602294921875	30
seven consecutive medical television series between 1961 and 2000.1 From this sampling	54.554107666015625	495.16094970703125	10.481353759765625	372.0016174316406	30
frame a proportionate stratified sample (Neuendorf, 2002) was drawn of two episodes per	54.5546875	507.642333984375	10.0	371.9950256347656	30
year. The resulting sample contained 76 different episodes from 38 different years, with a	54.5546875	519.642333984375	10.0	372.0029602050781	30

Media content was analyzed at the level of (a) entire episodes and (b) statements, using a con-	54.5546875	573.642333984375	10.0	372.0030212402344	32

The first dimension—referentiality—consists of variables that measure references to	72.5546875	597.642333984375	10.0	353.99493408203125	32
sources, references to the rules of science, the educational character of the statements and the	54.5546875	609.642333984375	10.0	372.00494384765625	32

operationalization of the reference to rules of science is based on the Mertonian imperatives	54.5546875	633.642333984375	9.999996185302734	371.99395751953125	32

The second dimension—news factors and media factors—consists of variables that	73.55500793457031	95.6107177734375	10.0	353.9960479736328	34
measure the visibility of these factors, as previously defined by Galtung and Ruge (1965) and	55.55500793457031	107.6107177734375	10.0	371.99400329589844	34
Schulz (1976, 1982). News factors can be considered the most important forms of expression	55.55500793457031	119.6107177734375	10.0	371.9939727783203	34
in the mediazation process. The concept of news factors gives rise to such variables as thresh-	55.55500793457031	131.6107177734375	10.0	371.99903869628906	34

In total, 31 variables were encoded. Eight variables were coded at whole-episode level,	73.55500793457031	239.61068725585938	10.0	353.9849090576172	34
including the speaking times allotted to various persons. This was only possible for the 1976 to	55.55500793457031	251.61068725585938	10.0	371.96299743652344	34
2000 period, owing to the availability of episodes; before 1976 the broadcasting organizations	55.55500793457031	263.6106872558594	10.0	372.03001403808594	34

After coding the variables of the whole episode, each episode was divided into a	73.55500793457031	287.6106872558594	10.0	353.9860382080078	34

before he or she is interrupted. In total, 7,242 different statements were identified in programs	55.55500793457031	311.6106872558594	10.0	372.01402282714844	34
in the period 1961–2000. A total of 24 variables were coded at the statement level.	55.55500793457031	323.6106872558594	10.0	332.7229461669922	34
All the variables and their possible values were defined and described in a code book. Four	73.55500793457031	335.6106872558594	10.0	353.98692321777344	34
coders encoded the data. A reliability subsample of 10 percent of the statements was drawn to	55.55500793457031	347.6106872558594	10.0	371.9899139404297	34
calculate Scott’s pi (π) (Lombard et al., 2002), which was calculated for the variables encoded	55.55500793457031	359.6106872558594	10.295257568359375	371.99705505371094	34
at statement level. The inter-coder reliability ranged from 0 to .98.	55.55400085449219	371.6106872558594	10.0	263.49195861816406	34
Given the research question, the speaking times allotted to persons were aggregated	73.55400085449219	383.6106872558594	10.0	353.9899444580078	34
annually. Time series were produced from these aggregated data to enable patterns over the	55.55400085449219	395.6106872558594	10.0	371.9899444580078	34
years to be observed.3 To support the interpretation of the patterns a bivariate regression	55.55400085449219	407.12945556640625	10.48126220703125	371.9942169189453	34
analysis was carried out. In order to enable variables to be compared the standardized regres-	55.55519104003906	419.6107177734375	10.0	371.98194885253906	34
sion coefficient (β) was reported. In addition to the bivariate regression analysis a one-way	55.55519104003906	431.6107177734375	10.295257568359375	371.9890594482422	34
ANOVA was conducted to explore significant differences in content in different time periods.	55.55419158935547	443.6107177734375	10.0	372.0090103149414	34

Seven consecutive medical series were analyzed, those connected to three television doctors	55.55419158935547	503.6107177734375	10.0	371.9960403442383	36
(Dr. van Swol, Dr. Haneveld, Dr. Gisolf) in the 1960s and 1970s, and Vinger aan de pols	55.55419158935547	515.6107177734375	10.01934814453125	372.0070266723633	36
(“Finger on the Pulse”) in the period 1981–2000. Vinger was the dominant medical program	55.55419921875	527.6107177734375	10.01934814453125	371.9989929199219	36
in the Netherlands at the time. It was anchored by medical journalist Ria Bremer, first in	55.554168701171875	539.6107177734375	10.0	371.9949645996094	36
cooperation with television doctor Dr. Lens and later (after 1987) alone.	55.554168701171875	551.6107177734375	10.000007629394531	289.9020080566406	36

An important indicator of the way medical science is represented on television is the speaking	55.554168701171875	598.6107177734375	10.0	371.9850158691406	38
time allotted to the various participants in the programs. Non-fiction medical television programs	55.554168701171875	610.6107177734375	10.0	371.9989929199219	38
show more than seventeen different groups of participants, falling into three categories: experts,	55.554168701171875	622.6107177734375	9.999996185302734	372.0069885253906	38

In order to distinguish between different kinds of experts and the different roles experts	72.55509948730469	58.6424560546875	10.0	353.9910125732422	40
can play, the participants in the category experts were encoded into three different subcate-	54.55509948730469	70.6424560546875	10.0	371.99195861816406	40
gories: pure scientists, other experts (medical and otherwise) and medical doctors. The total	54.55509948730469	82.6424560546875	10.0	372.0029754638672	40
speaking time of all these experts together decreased over time. Medical doctors, in different	54.55509948730469	94.6424560546875	10.0	371.9999237060547	40
roles, have by far the largest share of the speaking time of experts, followed by pure scientists.	54.55509948730469	106.6424560546875	10.0	372.00599670410156	40
The second category—journalists—also plays various roles in the programs, for example as	72.55509948730469	118.6424560546875	10.0	353.9950714111328	40
moderators or as on-location reporters or commentators. In the third category are laypersons,	54.55509948730469	130.6424560546875	10.0	371.98793029785156	40
such as patients and their families and representatives of patient groups and of the general public.	54.55509948730469	142.6424560546875	10.0	372.00794982910156	40
Figure 1 shows the speaking times observed in the three categories (i.e. experts, journalists	72.55509948730469	154.6424560546875	10.0	353.9989471435547	40
and laypeople) between 1976 and 2000. From 1976 to 2000 relative speaking times among the	54.55509948730469	166.6424560546875	9.999969482421875	371.97401428222656	40
three categories changed greatly. The speaking time allotted to experts decreased significantly	54.55509948730469	178.64242553710938	10.0	371.99403381347656	40
over this period (β = –.373, p < .10) and that allotted to laypersons increased (β = .357, p < .10).	54.55509948730469	190.64242553710938	10.295257568359375	372.0000457763672	40
The speaking time allotted to journalists did not change significantly from 1976 to 2000 (β =	54.55316162109375	202.64242553710938	10.295257568359375	372.0019836425781	40
.267, not significant). The pattern of the changes enables three periods to be identified. The first	54.55316162109375	214.64242553710938	10.0	371.9910583496094	40
was from 1976 to 1980, when experts had the most speaking time (54.7 percent). Television	54.55316162109375	226.64242553710938	10.0	371.9810485839844	40
doctors (in the roles of anchorman and doctor) moderated the programs and invited medical spe-	54.55316162109375	238.64242553710938	10.0	371.9981689453125	40
cialists and patients and other laypeople (38.9 percent of speaking time) to speak. Journalists	54.55316162109375	250.64242553710938	10.0	371.985107421875	40
(6.4 percent of speaking time) performed a supporting role as on-location reporters and occa-	54.55316162109375	262.6424255371094	10.0	371.99407958984375	40
sionally as commentators. Between 1981 and 1987 the pattern changed, with a markedly	54.55316162109375	274.6424255371094	10.0	371.9761047363281	40
increased role for journalists. In spite of visible cooperation with television doctors, journalists	54.55316162109375	286.6424255371094	10.0	371.9881591796875	40
acquired a larger share of speaking time (36.6 percent). Experts had a smaller share of speaking	54.55316162109375	298.6424255371094	10.0	372.0021667480469	40
time (31.3 percent) and from 1981 onwards the broadcasts no longer featured experts in the role	54.55316162109375	310.6424255371094	10.0	371.99090576171875	40
of scientists. Visible cooperation between television doctors and journalists ceased by 1987,	54.55316162109375	322.6424255371094	10.0	371.9819641113281	40
when doctors stopped playing an anchor role: from then on this was performed only by jour-	54.55316162109375	334.6424255371094	10.0	371.9759826660156	40
nalists. This period marks the beginning of a new era of speaking time distribution, which sta-	54.55316162109375	346.6424255371094	10.0	371.98199462890625	40
bilized further in the third period, from 1988 to 2000: speaking time allotted to experts	54.55316162109375	358.6424255371094	10.0	371.98602294921875	40
decreased even more (21.9 percent) in favor of laypeople (46.1 percent).	54.55316162109375	370.6424255371094	10.0	284.06097412109375	40
Content of the episodes	54.55316162109375	400.6617431640625	10.0	94.33799743652344	41
At episode level, we identified some significant changes in the content of medical television, as	54.55316162109375	418.6424255371094	10.0	371.998046875	42
shown in Figure 2. The presentation of topics in an impersonal context decreased (β = –.595,	54.55316162109375	430.6424255371094	10.295257568359375	372.0	42
p < .001): after 1988, 80 percent of the topics in medical programs were discussed in a personal	54.55316162109375	442.6424255371094	10.295257568359375	371.98712158203125	42
context. Stories were more often personified in the form of specific laypersons, patients and	54.55316162109375	454.6424255371094	10.0	371.9899597167969	42
their families, and less often in generalized stereotypes with which the public could identify.	54.55316162109375	466.6424255371094	10.0	371.99017333984375	42
This is underlined by the decrease in the number of children in the programs as an identifier for	54.55316162109375	478.6424255371094	10.0	371.9940490722656	42
the public (β = –.438, p < .05). Also, topics were less often discussed in a general way, leaving	54.55316162109375	490.6424255371094	10.295257568359375	371.98492431640625	42
aside the major or minor implications for certain people: not mentioning implications decreased	54.55315399169922	502.6424560546875	10.0	371.99805450439453	42
significantly (β = –.697, p < .001). This coincided with a decreasing proportion of non-thema-	54.55315399169922	514.6424560546875	10.29522705078125	371.99304962158203	42
tized episodes (β = –.737, p < .001). Gradually more attention was devoted to familiar subjects	54.55516052246094	526.6424560546875	10.29522705078125	371.9940643310547	42
and persons, with increasing thematization (β = .367, p < .10).	54.554176330566406	538.6424560546875	10.29522705078125	245.19695281982422	42
The threshold for gaining attention with medical television programs has increased for	72.55413818359375	550.6424560546875	10.000007629394531	353.9730529785156	42
basic health problems (everyday topics): interest in these problems has decreased significantly	54.55413818359375	562.6424560546875	10.0	371.90496826171875	42
(β = –.595, p < .001) over time.	54.55413818359375	574.6424560546875	10.29522705078125	126.06201171875	42
Many of the subjects dealt with in the programs that were produced in the 1960s/1970s	72.55413818359375	586.6424560546875	10.0	353.9800720214844	42
are basic health problems: most attention is paid to such matters as pregnancy and childbirth,	54.55413818359375	598.6424560546875	10.0	371.98797607421875	42
followed by dental care, accidents involving children, illness and holidays, allergies, venereal	54.55413818359375	610.6424560546875	10.0	372.0060729980469	42
diseases, puberty and so on. Besides these basic health problems, attention is also paid to	54.55413818359375	622.6424560546875	9.999996185302734	371.9880065917969	42

areas in which first-class clinical care and technological solutions play an important role. The	54.55509948730469	382.2738952636719	10.0	371.9961395263672	70
majority of the post-1988 programs are about diseases that need first-class clinical care or	54.55509948730469	394.2738952636719	10.0	371.9940643310547	70

participants in medical television programs from 1961 to 2000. The content has changed over	54.55509948730469	478.2738952636719	10.0	371.9889678955078	72
time, as can be seen from the differences in the three periods of speaking time identified.4	54.55509948730469	489.79254150390625	10.481353759765625	371.99989318847656	72
Until 1988, the statements analyzed included explicit verbal references to sources and	54.55509948730469	502.27392578125	10.0	371.9879913330078	72

about in the statement. After 1988 this was far less the case: reference to sources decreased	54.55509948730469	550.27392578125	10.000007629394531	371.99900817871094	72

There was also a decrease in the number of statements explaining medical problems or	72.55509948730469	586.27392578125	10.0	353.9910125732422	72

portion of statements articulating conflicts and disagreements increased significantly (β =	54.554115295410156	466.1251220703125	10.295257568359375	372.0019760131836	148

The study shows that the way medical science is represented and used in the Dutch media	54.554107666015625	586.1251220703125	10.0	371.9890441894531	150
changed from 1961 to 2000. There has been an unmistakable tendency towards mediazation.	54.554107666015625	598.1251220703125	10.0	371.97698974609375	150
The change seems to be more complex than the mediazation hypothesis suggests, however: it	54.554107666015625	610.1251220703125	10.0	371.96893310546875	150
is not a matter of science simply being replaced by journalism. The historical trend shows that	54.554107666015625	622.1251220703125	9.999996185302734	372.00506591796875	150

The speaking time of laypeople has increased significantly and the speaking time of experts	54.55509948730469	82.6424560546875	10.0	371.9960174560547	152
has decreased significantly.	54.55509948730469	94.6424560546875	10.0	109.87698364257812	152
Three different periods were identified on the basis of the observations. The first, from	72.55509948730469	106.6424560546875	10.0	353.99501037597656	152
1976 to 1980, could be called the “scientific period,” as the speaking time ratio favors experts.	54.55509948730469	118.6424560546875	10.0	371.99998474121094	152
The content analysis of statements indicates that this scientific era started earlier, in 1961. In	54.55509948730469	130.6424560546875	10.0	371.9960479736328	152
the second period, from 1981 to 1987, journalists took over the anchor role in medical	54.55509948730469	142.6424560546875	10.0	371.9769744873047	152
programs, hence it could be labeled the “journalistic period.” This marks the beginning of a	54.55509948730469	154.6424560546875	10.0	371.99403381347656	152
new distribution in which the speaking time allotted to experts decreased in favor of laypeo-	54.55509948730469	166.6424560546875	9.999969482421875	371.99302673339844	152
ple. This new distribution intensified and stabilized in the third period, from 1988 to 2000,	54.55509948730469	178.64242553710938	10.0	371.97898864746094	152
which could be termed the “lay period.”	54.55509948730469	190.64242553710938	10.0	161.0050048828125	152
In the 1980s, journalists started to take the lead in and to give direction to medical television	72.55509948730469	202.64242553710938	10.0	354.0039825439453	152
programs. Why this change took place cannot be derived from the content of the programs.	54.55509948730469	214.64242553710938	10.0	371.9589385986328	152
On the basis of the content of the programs, it seems that the “factuality regime” in the	54.55509948730469	226.64242553710938	10.0	371.99900817871094	152
programs has changed from a medical science one via a journalistic one to a lay one. A fac-	54.55509948730469	238.64242553710938	10.0	371.98707580566406	152
tuality regime is defined by Hagendijk (1996: 186) as a “collection of assumptions, goals,	54.55509948730469	250.64242553710938	10.0	371.9850311279297	152
impressions and rules which play a role in the production and evaluation of factual claims.”	54.55509948730469	262.6424255371094	10.0	368.4491729736328	152
These journalistic and lay factuality regimes increasingly mask science rules in favor of	72.55509948730469	274.6424255371094	10.0	353.9939727783203	152
an instrumentalized and symbolized image of experts, generally painting a picture of medical	54.55509948730469	286.6424255371094	10.0	371.9969940185547	152
science as a mere tool. To put it another way, science has become technology, more or less	54.55509948730469	298.6424255371094	10.0	371.9879608154297	152
simplistically presented as a scenic backdrop to the lives of laypeople. This observation	54.55509948730469	310.6424255371094	10.0	371.9880828857422	152
matches the way news factors function: several of these converged, especially after 1988, in	54.55509948730469	322.6424255371094	10.0	372.0019989013672	152
the direction of personifying laypeople. The speaking layperson is more often a recognizable	54.55509948730469	334.6424255371094	10.0	371.9899444580078	152
person with a personal tale that is followed over a lengthy period of time. This trend is in line	54.55509948730469	346.6424255371094	10.0	372.0499725341797	152
with the “layification” of speaking time in the programs.	54.55509948730469	358.6424255371094	10.0	228.10902404785156	152
This layification of the speaking time might be explained by the transformation in the	72.55509948730469	370.6424255371094	10.0	353.98695373535156	152
patient–doctor relationship that occurred between 1961 and 2000, and the rise of patient	54.55509948730469	382.6424255371094	10.0	371.9801483154297	152
activist groups and activism around specific diseases like AIDS (Epstein, 1996) or controver-	54.55509948730469	394.6424255371094	10.0	371.9919891357422	152
sies about treatments (Kent, 2003) or medicine (Andsager and Smiley, 1998). Those contex-	54.55509948730469	406.6424255371094	10.0	371.99891662597656	152
tual developments cannot be derived from this content analysis, although an increase in	54.55509948730469	418.6424255371094	10.0	371.9879913330078	152
speaking time for patient groups or representatives of activists was not found in this study.	54.55509948730469	430.6424255371094	10.0	363.9290313720703	152
A number of other news factors, however, have developed in a way that diverges from the	72.55509948730469	442.6424255371094	10.0	353.99900817871094	152
personification of laypeople: for instance, less attention is devoted to everyday medical prob-	54.55509948730469	454.6424255371094	10.0	371.9960479736328	152
lems, and after 1988 the television stories of laypeople were increasingly characterized by	54.55509948730469	466.6424255371094	10.0	371.99803161621094	152
change, emotions and conflicts. This indicates that a journalistic regime was also present in	54.55509948730469	478.6424255371094	10.0	371.9969940185547	152
the lay period, which constructs a narrative of personified laypeople, told in terms of news	54.55509948730469	490.6424255371094	10.0	371.9980010986328	152
factors: dynamics, valence, unambiguity and emotion.	54.55509948730469	502.6424560546875	10.0	217.4980010986328	152
This feature of media content in the lay period illustrates what we might call the paradox	72.55509948730469	514.6424560546875	10.0	354.0060577392578	152
of the layification of medical television: the lives of laypeople are not actually at issue, nor is	54.55509948730469	526.6424560546875	10.0	371.99705505371094	152
their everyday knowledge and context, which—in the journalistic factuality regime—are of	54.55509948730469	538.6424560546875	10.0	371.9969940185547	152
importance only as long as they are compatible with the news factors. This also results in	54.55509948730469	550.6424560546875	10.000007629394531	371.98597717285156	152

science have not completely disappeared, but they are more implicit and symbolical. This	54.55509948730469	610.6424560546875	10.0	371.9929656982422	152
trend could be the result of the introduction of commercial television in the Netherlands, which	54.55509948730469	622.6424560546875	9.999996185302734	371.9929656982422	152
began in 1989. The Dutch public broadcasting organizations may have anticipated this by	54.55509948730469	634.6424560546875	9.999996185302734	372.00599670410156	152

ture of the scientificized society, without problematizing or explaining science explicitly. The	55.55509948730469	118.6422119140625	10.0	372.00697326660156	154

shows a picture of a taken for granted, almost consumerist use of medical experts, medical	55.55509948730469	166.6422119140625	9.999969482421875	372.0019989013672	154
scientists and medical scientific knowledge. Such a one-dimensional media image of science	55.55509948730469	178.64218139648438	10.0	372.00096130371094	154
