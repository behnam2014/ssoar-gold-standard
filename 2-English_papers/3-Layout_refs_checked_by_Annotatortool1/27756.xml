Previous research has shown that exposure to violent media increased aggression-related	92.63787841796875	93.9791259765625	11.2794189453125	400.4197082519531	7

media promotes prosocial outcomes. Three studies revealed that listening to songs with	92.63714599609375	171.855224609375	11.2794189453125	394.1801452636719	7

Exposure to media is omnipresent in people’s daily life. For instance, listening to	125.87460327148438	120.017822265625	11.2794189453125	366.5814514160156	12
music—the topic of the present paper—is of substantial importance to many people: In	92.63601684570312	145.9365234375	11.2794189453125	392.9801025390625	12

Anderson, 2006). As with the GAM, the GLM assumes that media exposure affects internal	92.63223266601562	431.2821960449219	11.279449462890625	414.1148986816406	18

suggests that positive media can have positive effects. Thus, depending on the content of the	92.63140869140625	509.1582946777344	11.279449462890625	417.18719482421875	18

As predicted, participants who had listened to the prosocial songs were more likely to	125.87017822265625	509.1582946777344	11.279449462890625	386.74041748046875	44

prosocial action. Whereas previous research has demonstrated that violent media increased	92.633056640625	379.4447937011719	11.279449462890625	410.01910400390625	48
