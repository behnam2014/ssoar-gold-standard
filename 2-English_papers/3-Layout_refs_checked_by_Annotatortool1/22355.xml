Time is not just a physical phenomenon but open to psychological interpretation	40.35450744628906	418.9533996582031	10.0	317.9921112060547	4
(James, 1890/1950). Indeed, Suddendorf and Corballis (1997) noted that the	40.35450744628906	430.4533996582031	10.0	317.98204040527344	4
monitoring of time underpinned cognitive functioning. Thus learning to deal	40.35450744628906	441.9533996582031	10.0	317.98609924316406	4
with time, at both a subjective and objective level, is vital. Since time does not	40.35450744628906	453.4533996582031	10.0	317.98915100097656	4

characteristic of the human experience.	48.0	62.443115234375	10.0	156.85198974609375	8
As the interest in studying time has increased so too has the terminology	58.0	73.943115234375	9.999969482421875	307.9920959472656	8
researchers use to describe its various facets. This hasn’t necessarily led to	48.0	85.44308471679688	10.0	318.0050048828125	8
confusion but some blurring of concepts and constructs related to the study of	48.0	96.94308471679688	10.0	317.9891357421875	8
time do exist (Wallace and Rabin, 1960; Hoornaert, 1973; Hulbert and Lens,	48.0	108.44308471679688	10.0	317.98712158203125	8
1988; Nuttin, 1985). Time attitude, time perspective, temporal orientation, and	48.0	119.94308471679688	10.0	317.9960632324219	8
time perception are often synonymous with each other and interchangeable	48.0	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.9949951171875	8
(Hulbert and Lens, 1988). Other terms such as sense of time, subjective experi-	48.0	142.94308471679688	10.0	317.9900207519531	8
ence and temporal experience all point to the notion that individuals are aware	48.0	154.44308471679688	10.0	317.9920654296875	8
of the passing of time and may crudely divide time into frames or periods. While	48.0	165.94308471679688	10.0	317.98907470703125	8
time attitude is the affective response (positive or negative) towards past, pre-	48.0	177.44308471679688	10.0	317.99908447265625	8
sent or future time frames (Nuttin, 1985) time orientation is concerned with	48.0	188.94308471679688	10.0	318.0000305175781	8
determining which of these time frames an individual tends to favour (De	48.0	200.44308471679688	10.0	317.9960632324219	8
Volder, 1979). Nuttin (1985) defines time perception as judging the passage of	48.0	211.94308471679688	10.0	317.9909973144531	8
time itself but sees time perspective as a complex construct of four sub-factors,	48.0	223.44308471679688	10.0	318.0019836425781	8
namely extension, structuralization, and realism that can be applied to both past	48.0	234.94308471679688	10.0	317.9950256347656	8
and future perspectives (see Nuttin, 1985 for more detail on factors).	48.0	246.44308471679688	10.0	274.31103515625	8
The present article does not disagree with these definitions but chooses to	58.0	257.9430847167969	10.0	307.99310302734375	8
focus on how Zimbardo and colleagues define and operationalize TP. That is	48.0	269.4430847167969	10.0	317.98712158203125	8
that TP is ‘the manner in which individuals, and cultures, partition the flow of	48.0	280.9430847167969	10.0	317.99005126953125	8
human experience into distinct temporal categories of past, present and future’	48.0	292.4430847167969	10.0	318.001953125	8
(Zimbardo et al., 1997: 1008). Zimbardo and colleagues also sought to investi-	48.0	303.9430847167969	10.0	317.9841003417969	8
gate these past, present and future time frames more thoroughly by developing a	48.0	315.4430847167969	10.0	317.98809814453125	8
scale to measure TP, namely the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI).	48.0	326.9430847167969	10.0	318.0060119628906	8
Here the past, present and future temporal frames are subdivided into five sub-	48.0	338.4430847167969	10.0	318.0039978027344	8
scales. These are, firstly, the Past Negative (PN) temporal frame. This reflects a	48.0	349.9430847167969	10.0	318.0090026855469	8
pessimistic attitude towards the past and possibly the experience of traumatic	48.0	361.4430847167969	10.0	318.0030517578125	8
life events. Secondly, the Past Positive (PP), which is marked by a more	48.0	372.9430847167969	10.0	317.9910583496094	8
sentimental and positive view of one’s past. Thirdly, Present Hedonistic (PH),	48.0	384.4430847167969	10.0	317.9930725097656	8
associated with the desire for spontaneous pleasure with slight regard to risk or	48.0	395.9430847167969	10.0	317.99615478515625	8
concern for future consequences. Then there is the Present Fatalistic (PF) frame	48.0	407.4430847167969	10.0	318.0050048828125	8
which is defined as a lack of hope for the future and belief that uncontrollable	48.0	418.9430847167969	10.0	317.98907470703125	8
forces determine one’s fate. The fifth and final dimension, the Future (F), is	48.0	430.4430847167969	10.0	318.0071716308594	8
characterized by reward dependence that occurs as a result of achieving specific	48.0	441.9430847167969	10.0	318.0020751953125	8

depression, anxiety and low self-esteem, and it has been demonstrated that PN	40.35430145263672	50.943115234375	10.0	317.99405670166016	13
individuals have fewer close friends (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), gamble more	40.35430145263672	62.443115234375	10.0	317.99610137939453	13

(Klingeman, 2001) than those in other TP groups. Findings from Lyubomirsky	40.35430145263672	85.44308471679688	10.0	317.9871292114258	13

this. In contrast, high PP scores are related to high levels of self-esteem and	40.35430145263672	108.44308471679688	10.0	317.99805450439453	13

ing, can be beneficial for the individual provided they have some concept of	40.35430145263672	211.94308471679688	10.0	317.9891128540039	13

The Future sub-scale has been associated with less psychopathy (Wallace,	50.35430145263672	234.94308471679688	10.0	307.9950637817383	13

pation in a cancer-screening programme (Guarino et al., 1999). It is therefore	40.35430145263672	257.9430847167969	10.0	317.9960403442383	13
regarded as the more constructive time perspective in terms of engaging in	40.35430145263672	269.4430847167969	10.0	318.00208282470703	13
positive health behaviours. According to Kazakina (1999, cited in Zimbardo	40.35430145263672	280.9430847167969	10.0	317.9910659790039	13

(Epel et al., 1999). It has, however, been suggested that an overemphasis on	40.35430145263672	361.4430847167969	10.0	317.98307037353516	13

negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety and depression (Wills et al.,, 2001),	40.35430145263672	407.4430847167969	10.0	317.9831314086914	13

the consequences of actions, is typical of a predisposition to a present temporal	40.35430145263672	476.4430847167969	10.0	317.98804473876953	13

To facilitate wellbeing Boniwell and Zimbardo (2004) propose that one	50.35430145263672	499.4430847167969	10.0	307.9990921020508	13
should strive to achieve what they call a Balanced Time Perspective (BTP). This	40.35430145263672	510.943115234375	10.0	318.00403594970703	13

factors and relatively low scores for the PN and PF factors. It is operationally	48.0	50.943115234375	10.0	317.9950256347656	16
defined as the ability to hold past present and future time perspectives concur-	48.0	62.443115234375	10.0	317.9930419921875	16
rently but importantly to be able to move between each perspective and to use	48.0	73.943115234375	9.999969482421875	317.98895263671875	16
the most appropriate one in a given situation. Zimbardo and Boyd (1999) go as	48.0	85.44308471679688	10.0	317.9801330566406	16
far as to suggest that a BTP is central to optimal functioning. By that they mean	48.0	96.94308471679688	10.0	317.9951477050781	16
that the individual will reap psychological benefits if they are able to ‘work hard	48.0	108.44308471679688	10.0	317.9990234375	16
when there is a mission to be accomplished, but play hard when the work is	48.0	119.94308471679688	10.0	317.9830627441406	16
done’ (Zimbardo, 2002: 62). By achieving a BTP an individual’s actions are	48.0	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.9931335449219	16
shaped by a consideration of all three temporal zones (Zimbardo and Boyd,	48.0	142.94308471679688	10.0	317.9940490722656	16
1999; Boniwell and Zimbardo, 2003, 2004) as opposed to the limiting ability of	48.0	154.44308471679688	10.0	317.98516845703125	16
a dispositional bias towards one particular time frame. Accordingly, Boniwell	48.0	165.94308471679688	10.0	317.9970397949219	16
and Zimbardo (2004) propose that individuals with a BTP will be happier than	48.0	177.44308471679688	10.0	317.9930725097656	16
those who do not have a BTP. However, most TP research has yet to establish	48.0	188.94308471679688	10.0	317.986083984375	16
this. Most of the research has focused on specific temporal frames using varied	48.0	200.44308471679688	10.0	317.9940185546875	16
TP measurements rather than focusing on the BTP construct. For example,	48.0	211.94308471679688	10.0	318.0001220703125	16
Kazakina (1999, cited in Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999) found positive correlations	48.0	223.44308471679688	10.0	317.9841003417969	16
between a present orientation and positive affect and between a past positive ori-	48.0	234.94308471679688	10.0	317.99493408203125	16
entation and life satisfaction. There is also evidence of positive relationships	48.0	246.44308471679688	10.0	318.0011291503906	16
between present orientation and general happiness (Kammann and Flett, 1983),	48.0	257.9430847167969	10.0	317.9951171875	16
life satisfaction (Diener et al., 1985) and optimism (Lennings, 2000). Similarily,	48.0	269.4430847167969	10.0	317.99920654296875	16
Zaleski et al. (2001) showed that a future perspective was positively associated	48.0	280.9430847167969	10.0	317.9949951171875	16
with subjective wellbeing. However, a future orientation is positively correlated	48.0	292.4430847167969	10.0	317.9971008300781	16
with higher socio-economic status, which is only weakly related to wellbeing	48.0	303.9430847167969	10.0	317.99505615234375	16
(Diener, 2000). Assessing subjective wellbeing has been done in many ways	48.0	315.4430847167969	10.0	317.988037109375	16
(e.g. Diener, 1997; Peterson, 2000) and there are numerous constructs that relate	48.0	326.9430847167969	10.0	317.9950256347656	16
to subjective wellbeing. For the purposes of the present study we chose to focus	48.0	338.4430847167969	10.0	317.98199462890625	16
on a global, subjective assessment of happiness. Thus the present study used the	48.0	349.9430847167969	10.0	317.981201171875	16
Subjective Happiness Scale (Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999). This simply asks	48.0	361.4430847167969	10.0	317.98614501953125	16
people to evaluate how happy or unhappy they are and does not involve cogni-	48.0	372.9430847167969	10.0	317.97906494140625	16

The notion that a BTP allows the individual to be more fully engaged in any	58.0	395.9430847167969	10.0	307.986083984375	16
given situation corresponds with an aspect of consciousness called mindfulness.	48.0	407.4430847167969	10.0	317.99212646484375	16
Mindfulness, according to Hanh (1976) facilitates conscious awareness of the	48.0	418.9430847167969	10.0	317.9930419921875	16
reality of the present. Brown and Ryan (2003) investigated mindfulness as an	48.0	430.4430847167969	10.0	317.9930419921875	16

Thus the aims of the present study were first, to operationalize the five TPs of	40.35459899902344	72.443115234375	10.0	317.99510192871094	20

frames and subjective happiness. It is important that the measurement of happi-	40.35459899902344	95.44308471679688	10.0	318.00401306152344	20
ness chosen for this study is asking for a simple judgement of how happy or	40.35459899902344	106.94308471679688	10.0	317.98204040527344	20
unhappy participants feel which is in contrast to other studies that have used	40.35459899902344	118.44308471679688	10.0	317.9871368408203	20
more global judgements of life satisfaction. Second, the BTP construct will also	40.35459899902344	129.94308471679688	10.0	317.9931182861328	20
be operationalized to establish what relationship, if any, having a BTP has with	40.35459899902344	141.44308471679688	10.0	317.98719787597656	20
subjective happiness scores. Third, to investigate to what extent mindfulness	40.35459899902344	152.94308471679688	10.0	317.99305725097656	20
relates to each of the TPs and the BTP construct. Since mindfulness is synony-	40.35459899902344	164.44308471679688	10.0	317.98716735839844	20
mous with conscious absorption in the present then positive correlations	40.35459899902344	175.94308471679688	10.0	317.9940948486328	20
between particular TPs and the BTP should be evident. Thus the study will seek	40.35459899902344	187.44308471679688	10.0	317.98219299316406	20
to validate assumptions of the TP theory and the BTP construct as viewed by	40.35459899902344	198.94308471679688	10.0	317.99208068847656	20

On the basis of findings from previous research several hypotheses were	50.35459899902344	221.94308471679688	10.0	307.9999542236328	20
proposed. First, that those participants with a BTP profile would be more mind-	40.35459899902344	233.44308471679688	10.0	318.0000457763672	20
ful and happier than those not achieving a BTP profile (scores spread across	40.35459899902344	244.94308471679688	10.0	317.9970245361328	20
the other five temporal factors of the ZTPI). Second, that PP and F would be	40.35459899902344	256.4430847167969	10.0	317.9931182861328	20
positively correlated with mindfulness, while PN and PF orientations would be	40.35459899902344	267.9430847167969	10.0	317.9940948486328	20
negatively correlated with mindfulness. Further, given that high scores on the	40.35459899902344	279.4430847167969	10.0	317.99305725097656	20
PH scale are associated with risky activities and thrill seeking (Boniwell and	40.35459899902344	290.9430847167969	10.0	317.9990997314453	20

predicted that there would be a negative correlation between PH and mindful-	40.35459899902344	313.9430847167969	10.0	317.99900817871094	20
ness. It was also hypothesized that PP, PH and F would be positively related	40.35459899902344	325.4430847167969	10.0	317.9900665283203	20
to subjective happiness, but that PN and PF would be negatively related to	40.35459899902344	336.9430847167969	10.0	317.98707580566406	20
happiness. Finally, based on Brown and Ryan’s (2003) findings it was predicted	40.35459899902344	348.4430847167969	10.0	317.98414611816406	20

However, this study found that the most prevalent temporal frame profile	40.35430145263672	269.1814880371094	10.0	317.9990005493164	76

(n = 43). These individuals set themselves apart from the BTP group by having	40.35430145263672	292.1814880371094	10.019317626953125	317.9841079711914	76

ness was also carried out. It was hypothesized that the PH- and PP-subjective	40.35430145263672	326.6814880371094	10.0	317.99600982666016	76
happiness relationship would be positive and that the PN-subjective happiness	40.35430145263672	338.1814880371094	10.0	317.9850845336914	76
correlation be negative. These hypotheses were indeed confirmed and allow us	40.35430145263672	349.6814880371094	10.0	317.9950637817383	76
to state that the happier participants were those more likely to hold positive as	40.35430145263672	361.1814880371094	10.0	317.9921646118164	76
opposed to negative attitudes towards their past, be more spontaneous and live	40.35430145263672	372.6814880371094	10.0	317.98612213134766	76

Rather surprisingly the F factor was not significantly correlated with subjec-	50.35430145263672	395.6814880371094	10.0	308.00308990478516	76
tive happiness. A future orientation is apparently linked to positive functioning	40.35430145263672	407.1814880371094	10.0	317.9900894165039	76

less psychopathy (Wallace, 1956). It follows then that this would link to	40.35430145263672	430.1814880371094	10.0	317.9871292114258	76
higher levels of subjective happiness. However, it has to be acknowledged that	40.35430145263672	441.6814880371094	10.0	317.99210357666016	76

tives and wellbeing. Despite the links with higher optimism (Zimbardo and	40.35430145263672	464.6814880371094	10.000007629394531	317.99808502197266	76
Ryan, 1999), self-efficacy, and more adaptive coping strategies (Epel et al.,	40.35430145263672	476.1814880371094	10.0	317.99405670166016	76
1999) one should temper these findings by bearing in mind that Boniwell and	40.35430145263672	487.6814880371094	10.0	317.98206329345703	76
Zimbardo (2003) have suggested that an emphasis on achieving future goals	40.35430145263672	499.1814880371094	10.0	317.9881057739258	76
may compromise the level of enjoyment in present activities and the importance	40.35430145263672	510.6815185546875	10.0	317.99610137939453	76
of family values at the root of our own past. The present authors propose that an	40.35430145263672	522.1815185546875	9.999996185302734	317.9900588989258	76

one should take into account how future-oriented people would feel if goals and	48.0	73.943115234375	9.999969482421875	317.9900817871094	79

It was expected that the PF sub-scale would be negatively correlated with	58.0	108.44308471679688	10.0	307.9970703125	79
subjective happiness. It is not surprising that this aspect has been supported	48.0	119.94308471679688	10.0	317.9861145019531	79
since PF is said to be the most destructive factor as it has been associated with	48.0	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.9949951171875	79
higher levels of aggression, anxiety and depression (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999).	48.0	142.94308471679688	10.0	317.9831237792969	79
A fatalistic frame of the present does not however preclude concern for future	48.0	154.44308471679688	10.0	317.99700927734375	79
consequences. For example, in relation to health-promoting behaviour Hamilton	48.0	165.94308471679688	10.0	317.9941101074219	79
et al. (2003) found that a present orientation was not negatively correlated to	48.0	177.44308471679688	10.0	318.0000305175781	79
such behaviour.	48.0	188.94308471679688	10.0	63.305999755859375	79
It is our belief that this is the first study to test mindfulness in relation to time	58.0	200.44308471679688	10.0	308.006103515625	79
perspective. It was hypothesized that if mindfulness represents awareness and	48.0	211.94308471679688	10.0	318.00201416015625	79
the keeping of conscious thoughts in the present then one would expect that	48.0	223.44308471679688	10.0	317.9780578613281	79
those high on mindfulness are first, happier and second, possess particular time	48.0	234.94308471679688	10.0	317.987060546875	79
perspectives relevant to the mindfulness state. It may be that these people,	48.0	246.44308471679688	10.0	318.0010681152344	79
thanks to the mindfulness state, possess more ability to balance work, leisure	48.0	257.9430847167969	10.0	317.9970703125	79
and family demands and may be more likely to possess a BTP profile. Thus it	48.0	269.4430847167969	10.0	317.9881591796875	79
was hypothesized that mindfulness scores would differ significantly across	48.0	280.9430847167969	10.0	317.9990234375	79
those with a BTP profile and those without. Indeed the results showed that the	48.0	292.4430847167969	10.0	317.9901123046875	79
BTP group participants did score significantly higher on mindfulness than those	48.0	303.9430847167969	10.0	317.9921569824219	79
with other TP profiles. As predicted, certain temporal frames were related to	48.0	315.4430847167969	10.0	318.00396728515625	79
MAAS scores. As predicted the PP-MAAS correlation was positive, while the	48.0	326.9430847167969	10.0	317.9980773925781	79
PN-, PH- and PF-MAAS relationships were negative. However, the association	48.0	338.4430847167969	10.0	317.9990234375	79
between the future temporal frame and MAAS scores though positive was not	48.0	349.9430847167969	10.0	317.9891052246094	79
significant. Overall we can say that those who were more mindful tended to have	48.0	361.4430847167969	10.0	317.9971008300781	79
a more favourable perception of the past and towards life in general. Examining	48.0	372.9430847167969	10.0	318.0	79

It has to be acknowledged that the correlational nature of the research design	48.0	466.4430847167969	10.000007629394531	317.9949645996094	81

mechanisms between a BTP, the other temporal frames, and wellbeing.	48.0	489.4430847167969	10.0	317.9949951171875	81
However, the fact that those with a BTP showed higher levels of aspects of well-	48.0	500.9430847167969	10.0	317.9970703125	81
being supports basic tenets of the BTP construct. This study, we believe, is the	48.0	512.443115234375	10.0	317.98114013671875	81
first to attempt a BTP profile analysis and as such presents evidence in support	48.0	523.943115234375	9.999996185302734	317.99505615234375	81

of the Zimbardo and Boyd’s (1999) BTP theory. However, these findings should	40.35430145263672	50.943115234375	10.0	317.9840774536133	84

views with those with a BTP were not possible. We therefore suggest that future	40.35430145263672	96.94308471679688	10.0	317.9931106567383	84

The PP–subjective happiness correlation was the highest positive result of all	50.35430145263672	142.94308471679688	10.0	307.9931411743164	84
the time perspectives and subjective happiness scores. These findings are in line	40.35430145263672	154.44308471679688	10.0	318.0000686645508	84
with previous research on the happiness and time perspective (Kammann and	40.35430145263672	165.94308471679688	10.0	317.9979934692383	84
Flett, 1983; Lennings, 2000; Boniwell and Zimbardo, 2004). That a positive	40.35430145263672	177.44308471679688	10.0	317.9771194458008	84

the present study did not take into account participants’ past positive and/or	40.35430145263672	211.94308471679688	10.0	317.99112701416016	84

It is important to point out that results here could be influenced by the	50.35430145263672	315.4430847167969	10.0	307.99402618408203	84

to use a global measure that measured simply how happy or unhappy people	40.35430145263672	361.4430847167969	10.0	317.97916412353516	84
perceived themselves to be. Since measures of wellbeing assess either cognitive	40.35430145263672	372.9430847167969	10.0	318.00208282470703	84
or the emotional components of the construct, the present authors argue that	40.35430145263672	384.4430847167969	10.0	317.99903106689453	84
simplification was needed here. Notwithstanding this, it would be interesting to	40.35430145263672	395.9430847167969	10.0	317.99121856689453	84
probe the emotional components with respect to time perspective more purpose-	40.35430145263672	407.4430847167969	10.0	317.9939956665039	84
fully. For example, studies could perhaps use such measures as the Positive and	40.35430145263672	418.9430847167969	10.0	317.99210357666016	84
Negative Affect Scale (PANAS: Watson et al., 1988) and/or adopt the Emotion	40.35430145263672	430.4430847167969	10.0	317.99219512939453	84
Diary (Oatley and Duncan, 1994; Duncan and Grazzani-Gavazzi, 2004) or	40.35430145263672	441.9430847167969	10.0	317.9889907836914	84
Experience Sampling Methodologies. Such strategies would place scores on	40.35430145263672	453.4430847167969	10.0	317.99304962158203	84
time perspective scales in context. These would be most appropriate in a study	40.35430145263672	464.9430847167969	10.000007629394531	317.99112701416016	84
that aimed to investigate possible changes in the five factors across time.	40.35430145263672	476.4430847167969	10.0	290.9960708618164	84
The extent to which these results are generalizable must be treated with	50.35430145263672	487.9430847167969	10.0	308.00696563720703	84
caution even though steps were taken to widen recruitment beyond the student	40.35430145263672	499.4430847167969	10.0	317.9841079711914	84
population and to use a wide age range. We did not feel that there were sufficient	40.35430145263672	510.943115234375	10.0	317.9990005493164	84
numbers in particular age categories to be able to take a look at developmental	40.35430145263672	522.443115234375	9.999996185302734	318.0000991821289	84

changes in time perspectives. This would be an important next step for future	48.0	50.943115234375	10.0	317.9960021972656	87
research. Some consideration should also be given to the cultural context within	48.0	62.443115234375	10.0	317.9891357421875	87
which this investigation took place. In this Scottish sample it was found that a	48.0	73.943115234375	9.999969482421875	317.9901123046875	87
substantial number presented scores that indicated the predominance of past	48.0	85.44308471679688	10.0	317.9950866699219	87
negative and present fatalistic outlooks. The intriguing question is whether this	48.0	96.94308471679688	10.0	317.9900817871094	87
is serendipitous or a part of the character of Scottish culture? Indeed, to what	48.0	108.44308471679688	10.0	318.0050964355469	87
extent other cultures either share this profile or have their own unique profile is	48.0	119.94308471679688	10.0	317.9951171875	87
worthy of investigation. Since some research has indicated cultural variation	48.0	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.9989929199219	87
with regards to time and time perspective (Spangler and Petrovich, 1978; Sagie	48.0	142.94308471679688	10.0	317.9940490722656	87
et al., 1996; Brislan and Kim, 2003) we may have to accept that results here may	48.0	154.44308471679688	10.0	317.99603271484375	87
not be generalizable. However, research on time perspective itself is not yet	48.0	165.94308471679688	10.0	317.9961242675781	87
extensive enough to begin to suggest that certain individuals and/or cultures	48.0	177.44308471679688	10.0	317.9840393066406	87
‘own’ a particular global temporal bias.	48.0	188.94308471679688	10.0	158.260986328125	87

ral frames of the ZTPI. There is much yet that can be done to elucidate the BTP	48.0	211.94308471679688	10.0	317.9920654296875	87
profile itself and whether a temporal bias that compromises wellbeing would be	48.0	223.44308471679688	10.0	317.9981384277344	87
amenable to change, given appropriate interventions. Perhaps interventions that	48.0	234.94308471679688	10.0	317.99407958984375	87
facilitate the reflective, self-awareness skills inherent in mindfulness are a first	48.0	246.44308471679688	10.0	318.01708984375	87
