Reforms of the public sector have helped create a more efficient and effective public sector,	113.45999908447266	144.226318359375	10.02001953125	411.06844329833984	10
but also have created a number of problems. Both, the New Public Management and	113.45999145507812	159.767333984375	10.02001953125	411.0664367675781	10
“governance” reforms have contributed to the contemporary problems in governing. These	113.45999145507812	175.24822998046875	10.02001953125	410.9623107910156	10
problems have been political to a great extent, reflecting the tendency to emphasize	113.45999145507812	190.7291259765625	10.02001953125	410.9892883300781	10
administrative rather than democratic values. Governments have begun to react to the real	113.45999145507812	206.2701416015625	10.02001953125	410.9502258300781	10
and perceived problems within the public sector by developing a number of “meta-	113.45999145507812	221.75103759765625	10.02001953125	411.0434265136719	10
governance” instruments that can help steer public organizations but which involve less	113.45999145507812	237.23193359375	10.02001953125	410.9713439941406	10
direct command and control. This paper addresses the contemporary governance tasks of	113.45997619628906	252.77294921875	10.02001953125	411.0004119873047	10
restoring political direction and policy coherence while at the same supporting the autonomy	113.4599609375	268.25384521484375	10.02001953125	411.06756591796875	10
of public organizations, and the involvement of policy networks, in governing.	113.45997619628906	283.7347412109375	10.02001953125	339.5897979736328	10

Die in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten durchgeführten Reformen des öffentlichen Sektors	113.45999908447266	364.84637451171875	10.019989013671875	411.01839447021484	12
haben zu mehr Effizienz und Effektivität geführt, aber auch eine Reihe von Problemen mit	113.46000671386719	380.3272705078125	10.019989013671875	411.03041076660156	12
sich gebracht. Der Einzug von Ideen des New Public Management und des „Governance“-	113.46000671386719	395.8682861328125	10.019989013671875	411.04542541503906	12

beigetragen. Diese Probleme sind vor allem politischer Natur, da die Reformen zu einer	113.46000671386719	426.830078125	10.019989013671875	411.0083770751953	12
Überbetonung administrativer gegenüber demokratischen Werten geführt haben. Auf die	113.46000671386719	442.37109375	10.019989013671875	411.0474395751953	12
realen und die wahrgenommenen Probleme haben die Regierungen mit einer Reihe von	113.46002197265625	457.85198974609375	10.019989013671875	410.984375	12

beitragen können, aber weniger direkte hierarchische Kontrolle voraussetzen. Dieser Beitrag	113.46002197265625	488.8739013671875	10.019989013671875	411.00634765625	12

Introduction	113.45999908447266	127.9322509765625	13.97998046875	81.59705352783203	21
The public sector in most of our countries has undergone significant change during the past	113.45999908447266	162.226318359375	10.02001953125	410.99739837646484	22
several decades. Whether the changes have been described as “reform”, “modernization”,	113.46000671386719	177.767333984375	10.02001953125	411.0535430908203	22
“reinvention”, or whatever, most governments now are vastly different from what they were	113.46000671386719	193.24822998046875	10.02001953125	411.0264434814453	22
even a few years ago. These changes have, in general, produced governments that are	113.46002197265625	208.7291259765625	10.02001953125	410.98529052734375	22
more efficient and effective. Further, although most of the reforms implemented have been	113.46003723144531	224.2701416015625	10.02001953125	411.0164031982422	22
conceived largely within the market model (Peters, 2001) public administration is now also	113.46003723144531	239.75103759765625	10.02001953125	411.1196746826172	22
more open to public participation in many countries, and also has been opened to greater	113.46002197265625	255.23193359375	10.02001953125	411.00543212890625	22
participation by lower echelon public employees.	113.46002197265625	270.77294921875	10.02001953125	214.28973388671875	22
The dominant pattern of reform of the public sector over the past several decades has been	113.45899963378906	301.84600830078125	10.02001953125	410.8607635498047	23
discussed as the “New Public Management” (Hood, 1991; Christensen and Laegreid, 2001),	113.45899963378906	317.326904296875	10.02001953125	410.90122985839844	23
or simply NPM. The basic idea of NPM has been that government should be made to be	113.45901489257812	332.8679504394531	10.019989013671875	410.9352111816406	23
more efficient and effective, and that the best way of achieving these goals is to make the	113.45901489257812	348.3488464355469	10.019989013671875	410.9842834472656	23
public sector perform more like the private sector. One component of these reforms has	113.45901489257812	363.8297424316406	10.019989013671875	410.9683532714844	23
been to enhance the autonomy of managers and their organizations, with the assumption	113.45901489257812	379.3707580566406	10.019989013671875	410.9443054199219	23
that if managerial talent were unfettered by internal rules then the public sector would be	113.45901489257812	394.8516540527344	10.019989013671875	411.0585632324219	23
more efficient (DiIulio, 1994). In addition, this autonomy was to be enhanced by creating	113.45901489257812	410.3325500488281	10.019989013671875	410.9291687011719	23
numerous autonomous organizations (see Niskanen, 1971) such as the “Next Steps	113.45901489257812	425.8735656738281	10.019989013671875	410.9453430175781	23
Agencies” in the United Kingdom.	113.45901489257812	441.3544616699219	10.019989013671875	148.37518310546875	23
Although the participatory dimension of change may have been discussed sotto voce in	113.45899963378906	472.39111328125	10.054443359375	411.0323944091797	24
many reform processes, it has become a more central conception of reform. In particular,	113.468994140625	487.9665832519531	10.019989013671875	410.978271484375	24
while many of the initial stages of reform were discussed as the New Public Management,1	113.46900939941406	501.1418762207031	12.325592041015625	410.51377868652344	24
the increased interest in “governance” styles of reform has enhanced the participatory	113.45962524414062	518.92724609375	10.019989013671875	411.1006164550781	24
dimension of change (Peters, 2005). Like the idea of the New Public Management	113.45960998535156	534.46826171875	10.019989013671875	410.96128845214844	24
“governance” as a concept can be extremely vague (see Pierre and Peters, 2000), and has	113.45960998535156	549.94921875	10.019989013671875	410.93626403808594	24
been the subject of significant academic contestation. That having been said, most of the	113.45962524414062	565.4300537109375	10.019989013671875	410.9442443847656	24
“governance-style reforms” implemented by governments have emphasized the role of social	113.45962524414062	580.9710693359375	10.019989013671875	411.0694885253906	24
actors in making and implementing policy, and especially emphasized the role of networks	113.45962524414062	596.4519653320312	10.020004272460938	410.9682922363281	24
and analogous structures in the processes of governing societies.	113.45962524414062	611.932861328125	10.020004272460938	290.2343444824219	24
While both the New Public Management and governance styles of reform have made	113.45960235595703	643.0660400390625	10.020004272460938	411.00536346435547	25
significant contributions to the performance of the public sector, they have also created a	113.45960235595703	658.5469360351562	10.020004272460938	411.04149627685547	25
number of significant problems within government. In particular, both styles of reform have	113.4595947265625	674.02783203125	10.020004272460938	411.0042724609375	25
tended to create problems of incoherence and poor coordination in the public sector (see	113.4595947265625	689.56884765625	10.020004272460938	410.984375	25
1 This term was, and is, extremely broad and to some extent included participatory ideas as well as the market	113.45999908447266	735.9757080078125	9.732559204101562	410.9138412475586	26
based efficiency concepts. See Hood (1991).	113.45893859863281	748.708740234375	7.9799957275390625	158.80677795410156	26
2 — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — I H S	70.91999816894531	39.60638427734375	9.27484130859375	246.59642028808594	27
Bakvis and Juillet, 2004) and, in addition, those reforms have created extensive	70.91999816894531	109.7259521484375	10.02001953125	411.03538513183594	28
accountability problems (Mulgan, 2000). Therefore, like almost every other reform initiative	70.91999816894531	125.2669677734375	10.02001953125	410.9873504638672	28
before them, both NPM and governance reforms have engendered a host of new reforms,	70.91999816894531	140.74786376953125	10.02001953125	411.0495147705078	28
and the process of attempting to “make government work better and cost less” continues	70.91999816894531	156.228759765625	10.02001953125	410.97535705566406	28
unabated.2 Very much like Herbert Simon famously argued approximately 60 years ago,	70.91999816894531	169.46197509765625	12.32781982421875	411.02342224121094	28
most of the adages used in public management (and indeed private management) have	70.92202758789062	187.24725341796875	10.02001953125	410.9753112792969	28
opposites that are in the right circumstances equally valid.	70.92202758789062	202.7281494140625	10.02001953125	255.97091674804688	28
Given the above discussion, we are dealing with several alternative futures for the public	70.91999816894531	233.8663330078125	10.02001953125	411.05848693847656	29
sector in most industrialized democracies. Both of these futures will involve change, and	70.91999816894531	249.34722900390625	10.02001953125	410.9883270263672	29
both will require continuing investment of political capital in order to be effective. Further, the	70.91999816894531	264.828125	10.02001953125	410.9983367919922	29
central feature of these two futures is that one need not make a definitive choice between	70.92001342773438	280.369140625	10.02001953125	411.05645751953125	29
them. Both are feasible, and their effects will be complementary. The central political	70.93002319335938	295.85003662109375	10.02001953125	410.9181823730469	29
question is not so much one of making a choice between the two, but rather finding a way of	70.93002319335938	311.3309326171875	10.02001953125	410.83404541015625	29
making the two fit together in an effective, and democratic, manner.	70.93002319335938	326.8719482421875	10.02001953125	297.0889587402344	29
1. One Future – Continuing the Current Patterns of Reform	70.91999816894531	376.1522521972656	13.97998046875	388.82713317871094	30
Although I have been discussing them as alternative models of the public sector, as indeed	70.91999816894531	410.4463806152344	10.019989013671875	411.05348205566406	31
they are, the patterns of reform that have shaped contemporary government have a number	70.91999816894531	425.9272766113281	10.019989013671875	410.9401397705078	31
of things in common. Phrased in the most general manner, these reforms have tended to	70.91999816894531	441.4682922363281	10.019989013671875	410.9723358154297	31
move the process of governing out of the center of government. These reforms have	70.92001342773438	456.9491882324219	10.019989013671875	411.0084228515625	31
involved a number of different changes in patterns of governing, including:	70.92001342773438	472.4300842285156	10.019989013671875	327.0729064941406	31
1) Deconcentration. One of the most important changes associated with the New	113.45989990234375	503.5662536621094	10.291595458984375	368.39239501953125	32
Public Management has been creating a number of new autonomous or quasi-	113.44987487792969	519.047119140625	10.019989013671875	368.35630798339844	32
autonomous organizations – often referred to as agencies (Pollitt and Talbot, 2004;	113.44987487792969	534.528076171875	10.019989013671875	368.4503631591797	32
Verhoest, Rubecksen and Humphreys, 2007). A good deal of policymaking and	113.44987487792969	550.069091796875	10.019989013671875	368.4113311767578	32
implementation in contemporary political systems has been delegated to these	113.44987487792969	565.5499267578125	10.019989013671875	368.52149963378906	32
organizations, under the assumption that single-purpose organizations with	113.44987487792969	581.0308837890625	10.019989013671875	368.39927673339844	32
managerial autonomy will allow skilled public managers to improve the quality of	113.44987487792969	596.5718383789062	10.020004272460938	368.3863067626953	32
public services. This deconcentration also represents some denigration of politics	113.44987487792969	612.052734375	10.020004272460938	368.41322326660156	32
and politicians in the process of governance.	113.44987487792969	627.5336303710938	10.020004272460938	197.3599395751953	32
2) Decentralization. As well as moving some of the functions of the public sector	113.45989990234375	658.6658325195312	10.291656494140625	368.5025329589844	33
out to devolved organizations within central government, another strategy has	113.45989990234375	674.146728515625	10.020004272460938	368.45947265625	33
been to decentralize activities and give greater responsibility to sub-national	113.45991516113281	689.6276245117188	10.020004272460938	368.3661346435547	33
2 This phrase was, of course, the sub-title of the National Performance Review (Gore Commission) in the United	70.91999816894531	735.9757080078125	9.732559204101562	410.88670349121094	34
States but came to represent a general ambition for reformers in the public sector.	70.91891479492188	748.708740234375	7.9799957275390625	288.9677429199219	34
I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 3	277.79998779296875	39.60638427734375	9.27484130859375	246.67022705078125	35
governments. The logic of decentralization is in part to improve efficiency, given an	156.0	109.726318359375	10.02001953125	368.5335693359375	36
assumption that smaller units will provide services better. Also, decentralization can	156.0	125.267333984375	10.02001953125	368.4163818359375	36
be justified on democratic grounds, with the public having perhaps greater	156.0	140.74822998046875	10.02001953125	368.3111572265625	36
opportunity for involvement at lower levels of governing.	156.0	156.2291259765625	10.02001953125	246.68740844726562	36
3) Delegation. A final strategy for reforming the State has been to delegate public	156.0	187.3663330078125	10.2916259765625	368.511474609375	37
authority to a variety of other actors (for general models see Huber and Shipan,	156.0	202.84722900390625	10.02001953125	368.45745849609375	37
2002). In the market approach to governing much of that delegation has been to	156.0	218.328125	10.02001953125	368.4835205078125	37
contractors and to other market actors. In the governance model much of the	156.0	233.869140625	10.02001953125	368.34716796875	37
delegation would be to networks and to not-for-profit organizations. Both types of	155.99998474121094	249.35003662109375	10.02001953125	368.4193878173828	37
delegation can be thought to improve the efficiency of the public sector, and the	155.99998474121094	264.8309326171875	10.02001953125	368.4655303955078	37
use of networks of social actors also generally is argued to be important for	156.0	280.3719482421875	10.02001953125	368.48748779296875	37
enhancing the democratic element of governing.	155.99998474121094	295.85284423828125	10.02001953125	213.44606018066406	37
We might be able to add to this list of descriptions of change, but taken together all	156.0	326.92584228515625	10.02001953125	368.47747802734375	38
the reforms mentioned here involve “decentering” the governing process (see also	156.0	342.4668884277344	10.019989013671875	368.4775390625	38
Peters, 2004). Although obviously different in terms of their details, and in terms of	156.0	357.9477844238281	10.019989013671875	368.5206298828125	38
their justifications, the impact of all of the changes in the public sector has been to	156.0	373.4286804199219	10.019989013671875	368.40533447265625	38
minimize control from the center of government – presidents, prime ministers and	156.0	388.9696960449219	10.019989013671875	368.5306396484375	38
even individual ministers.3 Thus, they all have at their heart an assumption (explicit	155.99998474121094	402.1419677734375	12.32861328125	368.42250061035156	38
or implicit) that government will work better if the political center is devalued, and if	155.9970703125	419.9272766113281	10.019989013671875	368.52557373046875	38
public administrators and private sector actors are more responsible for delivering	155.9970703125	435.4682922363281	10.019989013671875	368.45947265625	38
services.	155.9970703125	450.9491882324219	10.019989013671875	39.50685119628906	38
2. From Reform to New Problems Created by Reform	113.45999908447266	500.232177734375	13.97998046875	350.1220932006836	39
The above changes in the public are often justified by the familiar “steering not rowing” logic	113.45999908447266	534.5263671875	10.019989013671875	410.95235443115234	40
(Osborne and Gaebler, 1991), assuming that governments are better at setting directions for	113.46000671386719	550.0673828125	10.019989013671875	411.1066436767578	40
policy than they are at actually delivering those policies. In reality, however, these reforms	113.46002197265625	565.5482177734375	10.019989013671875	410.9522705078125	40
may also have reduced the steering capacity of the public sector, and in particular have	113.46002197265625	581.0291748046875	10.019989013671875	410.9984130859375	40
reduced the capacity that political officials have enjoyed in the past for exercising control	113.46003723144531	596.5701904296875	10.020004272460938	411.05943298339844	40
over the policies of their governments. This reduction of the “primacy of politics”,4 has in turn	113.46005249023438	609.741943359375	12.329086303710938	411.0520324707031	40
created several governance problems:	113.4595947265625	627.5272216796875	10.020004272460938	170.05142211914062	40
3 This argument appears to be in direct contradiction to that usually found in comparative politics that emphasizes	113.45999908447266	685.9957275390625	9.732498168945312	410.8396224975586	41
the decline of parliamentary and even cabinet government in favor of prime ministerial domination – often incorrectly	113.45893859863281	698.728759765625	7.9799957275390625	410.9795379638672	41
called the presidentialization of parliamentary regimes (see Von Mettenheim, 1997; Heffernan, 2003). That	113.45895385742188	709.709228515625	7.9799957275390625	410.9388732910156	41
argument, however, focuses more on the political control of the process within government and changes in media	113.45896911621094	720.7455444335938	7.9799957275390625	410.88539123535156	41
focus rather than on the actual capacity of political executives to control policy.	113.45895385742188	731.7260131835938	7.9799957275390625	276.6171569824219	41
4 This term has come to be commonly used. For one of the earlier uses see Pollock (1951).	113.45999908447266	746.9557495117188	9.732498168945312	321.7524948120117	41

1) Politics and Steering. As already implied, the emphasis on moving activities	113.45989990234375	109.7259521484375	10.2916259765625	368.4865417480469	43
away from the center of government has reduced the capacity of elected officials to	113.45990753173828	125.2669677734375	10.02001953125	368.40123748779297	43
exercise control over these policies, even though in democratic politics we assume	113.45989990234375	140.74786376953125	10.02001953125	368.527587890625	43
that elections are about choosing policy (see Rose, 1974; Caplan, 2007). To the	113.45989990234375	156.228759765625	10.02001953125	368.4294128417969	43
extent that so much of government activity is delegated then political leaders are	113.45991516113281	171.769775390625	10.02001953125	368.47950744628906	43
left with few levers, and often poor quality levers, with which to affect the course of	113.45991516113281	187.25067138671875	10.02001953125	368.3422393798828	43
their own governments. Any number of prime ministers have expressed their	113.45991516113281	202.7315673828125	10.02001953125	368.48756408691406	43
feelings of impotence in the context of contemporary patterns of governing, but	113.45991516113281	218.2725830078125	10.02001953125	368.54762268066406	43
many fewer have actually done anything about attempting to redress that balance	113.45989990234375	233.75347900390625	10.02001953125	368.5145263671875	43
(but see below).	113.45989990234375	249.234375	10.02001953125	71.19911193847656	43
2) Coordination. A second difficulty resulting from the decentering of the public	113.45989990234375	280.36553955078125	10.2916259765625	368.4525146484375	44
sector has been reduced levels of coordination among policies and organizations.	113.44989013671875	295.846435546875	10.02001953125	368.40142822265625	44
The notion of first splitting up large organizations into a number of small	113.44989013671875	311.32733154296875	10.02001953125	368.4793395996094	44
organizations, and then giving organizations greater autonomy has been central to	113.44989013671875	326.86834716796875	10.02001953125	368.375244140625	44
reforming, especially the creation of agencies. The numerous organizations	113.44989013671875	342.3492736816406	10.019989013671875	368.4154357910156	44
operating with increased autonomy has, however, tended to exacerbate the familiar	113.44987487792969	357.8301696777344	10.019989013671875	368.47950744628906	44
problems of coordination and coherence in the public sector. The proliferation of	113.44985961914062	373.3711853027344	10.019989013671875	368.48046875	44
organizations, in turn, also contributes to the difficulties in exercising political	113.44987487792969	388.8520812988281	10.019989013671875	368.44044494628906	44
control.	113.44987487792969	404.3329772949219	10.019989013671875	32.82051086425781	44
3) Complexity. The larger number of organizations involved in governing, and the	113.45890045166016	435.4651794433594	10.291595458984375	368.44344329833984	45
multiple ways in which they are linked to the more conventional parts of the public	113.45890045166016	450.9460754394531	10.019989013671875	368.5496139526367	45
sector, also increase the complexity of governing. While complexity is not per se	113.45890808105469	466.4269714355469	10.019989013671875	368.4955596923828	45
detrimental, it may counteract some of the efficiency gains generated through	113.45890808105469	481.9679870605469	10.019989013671875	368.5165557861328	45
management changes. That is, the increased number of veto points in the system,	113.45892333984375	497.4488830566406	10.019989013671875	368.4193115234375	45
and the difficulty in gaining acceptance at all those points does reduce chances of	113.45892333984375	512.9298095703125	10.019989013671875	368.47052001953125	45
success. Further, complexity does tend to reduce the transparency of the public	113.45893859863281	528.4708251953125	10.019989013671875	368.50840759277344	45
system and therefore affects accountability (see below).	113.45893859863281	543.95166015625	10.019989013671875	246.41981506347656	45
4) Capture. By separating public organizations from direct connections to political	113.45890045166016	575.0247802734375	10.291595458984375	368.5205612182617	46
authority, the decentering reforms tend to make those organizations more	113.45890045166016	590.5657958984375	10.020004272460938	368.4634323120117	46
vulnerable to capture by other interests. This is a classic problem in the analysis of	113.45890045166016	606.046630859375	10.020004272460938	368.47457122802734	46
independent regulatory agencies in the United States and elsewhere, but the logic	113.45890045166016	621.527587890625	10.020004272460938	368.4955062866211	46
can be extended to cover a range of other organizations that have been detached	113.45890808105469	637.068603515625	10.020004272460938	368.44541931152344	46
from political support. The capture may be by local geographical interests	113.45892333984375	652.5494384765625	10.020004272460938	368.38232421875	46
(Whitford, 2002) or by functional interests, but the idea of depoliticizing government	113.45892333984375	668.0303955078125	10.020004272460938	368.5386047363281	46
tends to lead to other forms of politicization, often of a less desirable sort.	113.45890808105469	683.5714111328125	10.020004272460938	323.31834411621094	46
5) Accountability. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the reforms in the public	113.45890045166016	714.6444091796875	10.291610717773438	368.44637298583984	47
sector have generated major accountability problems. One virtue of the “primacy of	113.45889282226562	730.1253662109375	10.019996643066406	368.4615173339844	47
politics” is that it identifies clearly a hierarchy of accountability in the public sector,	113.45889282226562	745.6663818359375	10.019996643066406	368.4855041503906	47
I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 5	277.79998779296875	39.60638427734375	9.27484130859375	246.67022705078125	48
and also identifies a number of mechanisms for enforcing that accountability. When	156.0	109.726318359375	10.02001953125	368.550537109375	49
there are a number of alternative relationships between elected politicians and	155.99998474121094	125.267333984375	10.02001953125	368.3291778564453	49
service provision, and many of the service providers assume that they are meant to	155.99998474121094	140.74822998046875	10.02001953125	368.45143127441406	49
act autonomously, then identifying responsibility for actions is difficult.	155.99996948242188	156.2291259765625	10.02001953125	306.3113708496094	49
Thus, both from the perspective of democratic theory and from the perspective of policy	113.46009826660156	187.3663330078125	10.02001953125	411.01438903808594	50
capacity the reforms associated with the New Public Management approach, as well as	113.46011352539062	202.84722900390625	10.02001953125	410.9242248535156	50
those coming from the governance approach, have generated a substantial need for further	113.46011352539062	218.328125	10.02001953125	410.9382019042969	50
change. As I will point out below, these changes can not be a simple return to the status quo	113.46012878417969	233.834716796875	10.054443359375	411.00843811035156	50
ante with public sector dominance, although some scholars are arguing for a return to more	113.46014404296875	249.31561279296875	10.054443359375	410.92822265625	50
traditional forms of public management (Olsen, forthcoming). Too much change has occurred	113.46014404296875	264.8309326171875	10.02001953125	411.0323486328125	50
and governments have learned too much about alternative mechanisms for delivering	113.46012878417969	280.3719482421875	10.02001953125	410.9923858642578	50
services to be able to make a simple return to the bureaucratized, hierarchical model of	113.46014404296875	295.85284423828125	10.02001953125	410.96826171875	50
governing (see Walsh and Stewart, 1992). In part, the changes in the public sector	113.46014404296875	311.333740234375	10.02001953125	411.02337646484375	50
associated with these two reform movements have created substantial improvement in the	113.46014404296875	326.874755859375	10.02001953125	410.9542236328125	50
functioning of the public sector, at least at the more micro-levels.5	113.46014404296875	340.0419616699219	12.333709716796875	288.6627197265625	50
That having been said, however, the movement away from that style of governing has to	113.45989990234375	373.4263610839844	10.019989013671875	410.902099609375	51
some extent been exaggerated, and much of the old system remained in place, if subsumed	113.45989990234375	388.9673767089844	10.019989013671875	411.06646728515625	51
under the facade of new forms of governing (Schofield, 2001). Further, some scholars are	113.45989990234375	404.4482727050781	10.019989013671875	410.97222900390625	51
also discussing the return to a Weberian style of governing in many settings, with a	113.45991516113281	419.9291687011719	10.019989013671875	410.9482879638672	51
perceived need to reinvigorate some of the mechanisms for control and probity that were	113.45991516113281	435.4701843261719	10.019989013671875	411.0684051513672	51
components of more traditional forms of governing. This is far from just being reactionary, but	113.45989990234375	450.9510803222656	10.019989013671875	411.0926513671875	51
represents the need to recreate some values that were central to making governments both	113.45989990234375	466.4319763183594	10.019989013671875	411.00732421875	51
effective and accountable, and which have not been replaced adequately by the products of	113.45989990234375	481.9729919433594	10.019989013671875	411.072509765625	51
reform.	113.45989990234375	497.4538879394531	10.019989013671875	31.7213134765625	51
Leaving aside the return to a more Weberian style of governing, most of the problems	113.45989990234375	528.5260009765625	10.019989013671875	411.0203857421875	52
generated by the NPM and “governance” reforms can be encapsulated in the problem of	113.45988464355469	544.0670166015625	10.019989013671875	411.17262268066406	52
democratic government. Again, if elections are about selecting policy as well as leaders, and	113.45988464355469	559.5478515625	10.019989013671875	410.9882354736328	52
if those leaders once elected find that they have less influence over policy than they, and	113.45988464355469	575.02880859375	10.019989013671875	410.9322052001953	52
probably their voters, believe is appropriate, then there is a fundamental democratic	113.45986938476562	590.5697631835938	10.020004272460938	410.8640441894531	52
problem. Even if the elected leaders are able to do some of their steering without the rowing,	113.45986938476562	606.0506591796875	10.020004272460938	411.1106262207031	52
their level of policy control may not be as great as desired. This loss of control over policies	113.45986938476562	621.5315551757812	10.020004272460938	410.9572448730469	52
is evident for making policy choices, but is even more apparent given the crucial role that	113.45986938476562	637.0725708007812	10.020004272460938	410.9502868652344	52
implementation plays in determining the true meaning of policy (Meyers and Vorsanger,	113.45988464355469	652.553466796875	10.020004272460938	411.03639221191406	52
2004).	113.45988464355469	668.0343627929688	10.020004272460938	28.371627807617188	52
5 By that I mean that the closer one gets to the actual delivery of services, and especially to the operations of	113.45999908447266	724.9957275390625	9.732498168945312	410.9386215209961	53
individual organizations, the greater have been the benefits of reform. When more systemic factors in governing are	113.45895385742188	737.728759765625	7.9799957275390625	410.9676208496094	53
considered, the benefits of the reforms may be negligible and the costs may have outweighed the benefits.	113.45893859863281	748.709228515625	7.9799957275390625	376.4260711669922	53

sector. In some instances this shift in ideas about governing has reflected particular political	70.91998291015625	175.24822998046875	10.02001953125	410.99517822265625	56
circumstances, including changes in the political parties controlling the public sector. In other	70.91998291015625	190.7291259765625	10.02001953125	410.9823913574219	56

changes in ideas about governing. These changes reacting to the problems created by NPM	70.92001342773438	221.75103759765625	10.02001953125	411.0154113769531	56
et al. have not had the generality of either NPM or governance ideas, but they do reflect the	70.91999816894531	237.23193359375	10.02001953125	410.9953155517578	56
perceived need to recapture some of the political steering that has been lost.	70.91999816894531	252.77294921875	10.02001953125	338.46754455566406	56
Some of the attempts to reimpose control over governing have tended to run counter to	70.91999816894531	283.84600830078125	10.02001953125	411.0164337158203	57
many of the canons of “good governance”. In particular, when faced with the number of	70.91999816894531	299.326904296875	10.02001953125	411.07850646972656	57
organizations and programs over which they perceive themselves to have little direct control,	70.91998291015625	314.867919921875	10.02001953125	411.01837158203125	57
political leaders have tended to politicize the management of those programs. A number of	70.91998291015625	330.3488464355469	10.019989013671875	410.9372863769531	57
studies of the public sector in the industrialized democracies (Peters and Pierre, 2004) have	70.91998291015625	345.8297424316406	10.019989013671875	411.05450439453125	57
shown that political leaders have found themselves in the position of having to take political	70.91998291015625	361.3707580566406	10.019989013671875	411.1156005859375	57
responsibility for programs that they have little capacity to influence directly, and that this is	70.91999816894531	376.8516540527344	10.019989013671875	411.05247497558594	57
an extremely uncomfortable position for those leaders. One of the simplest means of	70.91999816894531	392.3325500488281	10.019989013671875	411.1125946044922	57
attempting to gain such control is to have one’s own people managing the programs, e.g. to	70.92001342773438	407.8735656738281	10.019989013671875	411.05950927734375	57
move toward higher levels of political appointment. Somewhat paradoxically, the internal	70.92001342773438	423.3544616699219	10.019989013671875	411.0704650878906	57
deregulation of public employment fostered by NPM has facilitated those appointments.6	70.92001342773438	436.52197265625	12.3333740234375	390.12286376953125	57
In addition to politicization, the decentering of the State has tended to engender the	70.91999816894531	469.96636962890625	10.019989013671875	410.9371795654297	58
identification of scapegoats and denial of responsibility. As noted, political leaders may	70.91998291015625	485.447265625	10.019989013671875	411.02142333984375	58
believe that they are being held responsible without justification, and in turn attempt to shed	70.91998291015625	500.92816162109375	10.019989013671875	410.9532165527344	58
that responsibility. To some extent the complaint is justified, given that many of the linkages	70.91998291015625	516.4691162109375	10.019989013671875	410.9953308105469	58
associated with effective responsibility and accountability have been weakened, and many of	70.91995239257812	531.9500732421875	10.019989013671875	411.0975341796875	58
the levers for control have been eliminated. In fact, even some of the mechanisms being	70.91996765136719	547.430908203125	10.019989013671875	410.9483184814453	58
used in an apparent attempt to create responsibility for service provision may, in the end,	70.91996765136719	562.971923828125	10.019989013671875	410.8701629638672	58
dilute that responsibility. For example, the increasing use of “czars” for problem areas of	70.91996765136719	578.452880859375	10.019989013671875	411.07850646972656	58
public service tend to deflect attention, and potentially accountability, away from the political	70.92996215820312	593.9337158203125	10.020004272460938	411.0353698730469	58
leaders and in the direction of the “czar”.7	70.92997741699219	607.1619873046875	12.332748413085938	183.0529022216797	58
6 It is quite possible that these appointments are perfectly qualified as managers, but it is very clear that there are	70.91999816894531	674.9556884765625	9.732559204101562	410.9361114501953	59
more political forms of appointment, and that those appointments give the appearance of politicizing the public	70.9189224243164	687.74462890625	7.9799957275390625	410.9555892944336	59
sector in ways that in many politic systems are unacceptable.	70.91893005371094	698.72509765625	7.9799957275390625	216.34495544433594	59
7 The Blair government in the United Kingdom was the most enthusiastic user of czars, for problems such as the	70.91999816894531	713.9557495117188	9.732498168945312	410.98802185058594	60
railways, several aspects of the National Health Service, and for children’s services, among others. This mechanism	70.91889953613281	726.7445678710938	7.9799957275390625	410.9819793701172	60
enables the Prime Minister or a minister to argue that something has been done, and thereby to (attempt to) escape	70.91889953613281	737.72509765625	7.9799957275390625	410.85987854003906	60

Not all of the reactions to the perceived loss of political control have been as negative as	113.45999908447266	109.726318359375	10.02001953125	411.06148529052734	62
those already discussed. Perhaps most obviously, a number of governments have been	113.46000671386719	125.267333984375	10.02001953125	411.0545196533203	62
attempting to build mechanisms for coordinating the numerous programs and autonomous	113.45999145507812	140.74822998046875	10.02001953125	410.9423522949219	62
organizations that have been created. One of the more obvious of these attempts has been	113.45999145507812	156.2291259765625	10.02001953125	411.0314025878906	62
the movement of “joined up government” in the United Kingdom, but there have been	113.45999145507812	171.7701416015625	10.02001953125	411.0683898925781	62
analogous programs in a number of other countries (Pollitt, 2005; Christensen and Laegreid,	113.45999145507812	187.25103759765625	10.02001953125	411.0906066894531	62
2007; Gregory, 2004). The basic idea has been to attempt to integrate government after it	113.45999145507812	202.73193359375	10.02001953125	411.0363464355469	62
had been disaggregated by previous regimes. In some cases, the attempt was structural, but	113.45999145507812	218.27294921875	10.02001953125	411.0324401855469	62
in others there was a more intellectual thrust of attempting to create more “holistic”	113.45999145507812	233.75384521484375	10.02001953125	411.0113830566406	62
government that could provide a relatively seamless web of services (6, Leat, Setzler and	113.46000671386719	249.2347412109375	10.02001953125	411.02137756347656	62
Stoker, 2004).	113.46000671386719	264.7757568359375	10.02001953125	61.743255615234375	62
To some extent the notion of joining up government, while certainly a valuable contribution to	113.45999908447266	295.8458251953125	10.02001953125	411.00435638427734	63
governing, missed some of the crucial elements of the decentering reforms. The attempts to	113.45999908447266	311.32672119140625	10.02001953125	411.06441497802734	63
improve coordination were indeed joined up government, and apparently were less	113.45999145507812	326.83331298828125	10.054443359375	410.9684143066406	63
interested in joining up the other non-governmental aspects of governing that had become	113.46002197265625	342.3486633300781	10.019989013671875	410.9923095703125	63
so important. In fairness, attempting to produce integration at that level would be more	113.46000671386719	357.8295593261719	10.019989013671875	411.0233917236328	63
difficult, and might even be counterproductive, if viewed from rather conventional	113.46000671386719	373.3705749511719	10.019989013671875	411.00233459472656	63
perspectives of governing. That is, simply attempting to bring the various relationships with	113.46000671386719	388.8514709472656	10.019989013671875	410.9873809814453	63
social actors into a single format, and/or to reduce autonomy, may eliminate the gains from	113.46000671386719	404.3323669433594	10.019989013671875	411.0203399658203	63
the previous reforms without necessarily creating commensurate benefits.	113.46000671386719	419.8733825683594	10.019989013671875	326.1649627685547	63

The discussion to this point reveals the presence of two distinct formats for contemporary	113.45999908447266	503.4463806152344	10.019989013671875	411.1406478881836	65
governance. As already noted, these two styles, while distinct, are also to a great extent	113.46000671386719	518.92724609375	10.019989013671875	410.95326232910156	65
complementary. One governance style emphasizes the need to improve the quality of	113.46000671386719	534.46826171875	10.019989013671875	411.02247619628906	65
service delivery, the management of individual organizations, and the democratization of	113.46000671386719	549.94921875	10.019989013671875	411.05751037597656	65
those services. The reforms associated with both NPM and with “governance” have been	113.46000671386719	565.4300537109375	10.019989013671875	411.01637268066406	65
successful in a number of cases, but then created the need for the second pattern of	113.46000671386719	580.9710693359375	10.019989013671875	411.05140686035156	65
change, one that emphasizes the need to coordinate, create greater coherence, and to	113.45999145507812	596.4519653320312	10.020004272460938	411.0114440917969	65
restore the primacy of politics. Each of these approaches to governing constitutes an	113.46000671386719	611.932861328125	10.020004272460938	410.92408752441406	65
important contribution to the capacity to provide better governing, but they are rather	113.46000671386719	627.473876953125	10.020004272460938	410.95826721191406	65
different. The major task in governing, therefore, may become to “knit” together the two	113.46002197265625	642.9547729492188	10.020004272460938	410.9422607421875	65

In addition to the practical issues of governing involved, these two approaches to governing	113.45999908447266	689.5658569335938	10.020004272460938	411.0573959350586	66
represent interesting theoretical concerns. On the one hand, there have been important	113.45999908447266	705.0467529296875	10.020004272460938	410.95027923583984	66
theoretical developments in the area of “governance” (Sørenson and Torfing, 2000; Klijn and	113.45999908447266	720.5276489257812	10.019996643066406	410.9602279663086	66
Koopenjan, 2005). As implied above this term has come to mean a number of different	113.4599609375	736.0686645507812	10.019996643066406	411.04644775390625	66

things, but perhaps the dominant strand has emphasized the need to consider the process of	70.91999816894531	109.7259521484375	10.02001953125	411.0485076904297	68
providing direction to society, and providing public services, as involving actors well beyond	70.91999816894531	125.2669677734375	10.02001953125	410.99034118652344	68
those nominally in the public sector. Thus, the “governance” reforms mentioned above	70.91998291015625	140.74786376953125	10.02001953125	411.0454406738281	68

that involvement is reflected a justified in a growing body of social scientific literature.	70.91999816894531	171.769775390625	10.02001953125	375.2249298095703	68
One could argue that the concern with governance is old wine in new bottles given that,	70.9209976196289	202.8458251953125	10.02001953125	411.10460662841797	69

involvement of social actors with the public sector has to some extent changed as networks	70.92098999023438	249.3486328125	10.02001953125	410.9933776855469	69
have strengthened. Further, the theory surrounding that involvement of private sector actors	70.92098999023438	264.82952880859375	10.02001953125	410.9883117675781	69
has certainly changed. For example, rather than much of the involvement being motivated by	70.92095947265625	280.37054443359375	10.02001953125	411.1305847167969	69

While governance theory, and its development of the logic of networks, has made a number	70.91999816894531	357.9463806152344	10.019989013671875	410.99940490722656	70
of contributions to our understanding of the processes of steering the economy and society,	70.91999816894531	373.4272766113281	10.019989013671875	410.93418884277344	70
it also has a number of internal problems. One of the most important of these problems has	70.91999816894531	388.9682922363281	10.019989013671875	410.9250946044922	70
been the assumption of decision-making capacity of networks. The network model appears	70.92001342773438	404.4491882324219	10.019989013671875	411.016357421875	70
well-suited for conditions in which the principal actors agree on goals and on means, but	70.91999816894531	419.9300842285156	10.019989013671875	411.0345001220703	70
paradoxically if there were that level of agreement then there might be no need for the	70.91999816894531	435.4710998535156	10.019989013671875	410.97633361816406	70
networks in the first instance.9 While the networks are advanced as alternatives to	70.91999816894531	448.6419677734375	12.33001708984375	411.0057830810547	70
conventional forms of governing, they lack pre-determined decision-rules that both enable	70.92143249511719	466.4272766113281	10.019989013671875	411.03648376464844	70
decisions to be made in the most difficult of circumstances, and also legitimate those	70.92141723632812	481.9682922363281	10.019989013671875	410.9442443847656	70

In addition to the problem in making decisions at all, the absence of clear decision rules may	70.9197998046875	528.5263671875	10.019989013671875	411.0013732910156	71
lead to the decisions being sub-optimal. Much as Fritz Scharpf (1988) argued about	70.9197998046875	544.0673828125	10.019989013671875	410.99932861328125	71
decision-making in multi-level governance systems, the need to reach consensus may lead	70.9197998046875	559.5482177734375	10.019989013671875	411.02044677734375	71
to decisions by the lowest common denominator. If there are multiple constituencies with	70.9197998046875	575.0291748046875	10.019989013671875	411.0615539550781	71
8 That having been said, some scholars of governance do note the extent to which the State is crucial for	70.91999816894531	624.9757080078125	9.732559204101562	411.0837860107422	72

policy. Likewise, networks might have little raison d’etre were State authority, even if delegated, available for the	70.91893005371094	648.7176513671875	8.007461547851562	410.93568420410156	72
implementation of the decisions made. These factors are crucial for the meta-governance arguments presented	70.9189453125	659.7255859375	7.9799957275390625	410.9253234863281	72

9 The most obvious case would be epistemic communities in which there is an agreement based on a common	70.91999816894531	685.9957275390625	9.732498168945312	410.8811798095703	73

10 Majority rule in legislatures, for example, permits decisions to be made even in the face of conflict, while the more	70.91999816894531	713.9557495117188	9.732498168945312	410.8936004638672	74
consensual logic of networks may render such decision-making difficult. Further, as these constitutional decision	70.9178466796875	726.7445678710938	7.9799957275390625	410.984375	74
rules are known in advance, they tend to legitimate those decisions, at least in the procedural sense of the term	70.9178466796875	737.72509765625	7.9799957275390625	410.9109191894531	74

may be to find the few points of agreement. The more or less incremental outcomes from	113.46000671386719	125.267333984375	10.02001953125	411.0805206298828	76

but may add little to the capacity for innovation and for major policy change (but see Dente,	113.46002197265625	156.2291259765625	10.02001953125	410.95831298828125	76
Bobbio and Spada, 2003). That having been said, assuming that such incremental decisions	113.46002197265625	171.7701416015625	10.02001953125	410.9501953125	76
could be made, implementation would be facilitated because the potential opposition to	113.46002197265625	187.25103759765625	10.02001953125	410.98126220703125	76

Finally, and most importantly perhaps, the delegation of substantial amounts of authority has	113.45999908447266	233.86614990234375	10.02001953125	411.11470794677734	77
led to major problems of democracy. These democratic problems involve not only	113.46000671386719	249.3470458984375	10.02001953125	410.9331817626953	77
accountability but also representation – both fundamental democratic values. This is, of	113.46000671386719	264.82794189453125	10.02001953125	410.96131896972656	77
course, rather paradoxical given that one of the principal justifications for at least some	113.46000671386719	280.36895751953125	10.02001953125	411.00135803222656	77
aspects of delegation has been to enhance public involvement. Despite those good	113.46000671386719	295.849853515625	10.02001953125	410.9702911376953	77

“potential groups” with low levels of organization may not be represented adequately.	113.46000671386719	326.87176513671875	10.02001953125	374.72386169433594	77
These challenges to governance theory mirror very closely the problems faced by	113.45999908447266	357.9457702636719	10.019989013671875	411.09859466552734	78

national governments, or whatever other actor may be used to make and implement policy	113.45999145507812	388.9676818847656	10.019989013671875	411.1256408691406	78
creates agency problems, so that the political principals can not produce effective control	113.45999145507812	404.4485778808594	10.019989013671875	411.0704650878906	78
(Huber and Shipan, 2002). Whether the problem is phrased in terms of principals and	113.45999145507812	419.9294738769531	10.019989013671875	411.0084533691406	78

The theoretical development in governance has now extended to the idea of “meta-	113.45999908447266	550.0662841796875	10.019989013671875	410.9723129272461	80
governance”, meaning in essence the governance of governance (see O’Toole, 2007). The	113.46000671386719	565.547119140625	10.019989013671875	410.98939514160156	80
weaknesses of governance as an encompassing concept for describing what occurs within	113.45999145507812	581.028076171875	10.019989013671875	410.9822692871094	80
in the contemporary processes of governing have become more apparent, even to some	113.45999145507812	596.5690307617188	10.020004272460938	410.9943542480469	80
advocates of the approach. This awareness has generated the need to think about the	113.46000671386719	612.0499267578125	10.020004272460938	411.0012969970703	80
means of building into governing processes increased control, while at the same time	113.45999145507812	627.5308227539062	10.020004272460938	410.9743347167969	80
permitting some autonomy for the networks and other forms of decentered governing. Any	113.45999145507812	643.0718383789062	10.020004272460938	410.9943542480469	80
reasonable conceptualization of contemporary governance processes must contain a great	113.46000671386719	658.552734375	10.020004272460938	411.00233459472656	80
deal of decentered activity, and recognize that it is impossible to return to the status quo	113.4599609375	673.999267578125	10.054367065429688	411.03948974609375	80
ante. At the same time, however, that conceptualization must also recognize that all of the	113.4599609375	689.540283203125	10.054367065429688	410.96221923828125	80

requisite functions of governing a society can not be fulfilled by those decentered	70.91999816894531	109.7259521484375	10.02001953125	410.96726989746094	82

Developing a working conception of meta-governance therefore helps to bridge the gap	70.92009735107422	156.3463134765625	10.02001953125	410.9672622680664	83

of many political principals to restore some direct control. In the bluntest terms then meta-	70.92009735107422	187.36822509765625	10.02001953125	410.9362564086914	83
governance would simply be reneging on the delegations of power and recenteralizing	70.92008972167969	202.84912109375	10.02001953125	411.04246520996094	83
controls in the structures associated with the “conventional” public sector. As already argued,	70.92008972167969	218.33001708984375	10.02001953125	411.0764617919922	83

government, and have created their own constituencies. Further, the ideology of New Public	70.91961669921875	264.828125	10.02001953125	410.9923095703125	83

choices concerning internal management. The discourse surrounding public management	70.91963195800781	295.85003662109375	10.02001953125	410.9502716064453	83
has been altered in a fundamental manner so that any simplistic atavistic response is	70.91963195800781	311.3309326171875	10.02001953125	410.96739196777344	83

As well as thinking about meta-governance as a simple reaction to changes in the public	70.91960144042969	357.9460754394531	10.019989013671875	410.9573516845703	84

conditions under which governance models can perform effectively. For example, much of	70.91961669921875	388.9679870605469	10.019989013671875	410.99029541015625	84

many cases they must be created and fostered, often by the State. Likewise, in order to be	70.91958618164062	419.9297790527344	10.019989013671875	411.04541015625	84
effective, a network must have a point of access in the public sector that legitimates and	70.91958618164062	435.4707946777344	10.019989013671875	411.1005554199219	84
motivates the involvement of the members, with public bureaucracies providing most of	70.91958618164062	450.9516906738281	10.019989013671875	410.9804382324219	84
those points of access. In addition, the actions of any policy network may have to be	70.91958618164062	466.4325866699219	10.019989013671875	411.06048583984375	84

Governments have at their disposal much of the same toolbox for meta-governance that they	70.91999816894531	596.5662231445312	10.020004272460938	411.13465881347656	86
have for coping with other policy problems, but those tools are available in somewhat	70.92001342773438	612.047119140625	10.020004272460938	410.97528076171875	86
different mixtures. The mixture has changed in part because of the specific tasks involved in	70.92001342773438	627.5280151367188	10.020004272460938	411.0823669433594	86

approaches do have the capacity to identify important issues and also to identify the possible solutions to those	70.91786193847656	687.74462890625	7.9799957275390625	410.93568420410156	87
problems. In particular, in this instance knowing what must be done to govern helps to understand why the	70.91786193847656	698.72509765625	7.9799957275390625	410.84141540527344	87
decentered formats may be inadequate.	70.9178466796875	709.70556640625	7.9799957275390625	141.27471923828125	87
12 The politics involved here are more likely institutional politics, defending the prerogatives of some organization or	70.91999816894531	724.9957275390625	9.732498168945312	410.89598083496094	88
program or another, rather than partisan politics. Those institutional interests may, of course, be connected to the	70.92582702636719	737.728759765625	7.9799957275390625	410.95716857910156	88

meta-governance as opposed to those of attempting to influence society. Importantly, meta-	113.45999908447266	109.726318359375	10.02001953125	410.97225189208984	90
governance involves attempting to shape behaviors of organizations that have some political	113.45999145507812	125.267333984375	10.02001953125	411.0314025878906	90

viable. The mixture of tools is now also different for meta-governance because there has	113.45999145507812	156.2291259765625	10.02001953125	410.9272155761719	90
been some general move toward “New Governance” (Salamon, 2001), implying using	113.45999145507812	171.7701416015625	10.02001953125	410.8711242675781	90
negotiation, bargaining and broader ranges of compliance than in conventional command	113.45999145507812	187.25103759765625	10.02001953125	410.8981018066406	90
and control styles of intervention. Given the general differences in meta-governance from	113.45999145507812	202.73193359375	10.02001953125	411.0755310058594	90
governance, it is necessary to consider some range of alternatives, or complements, to	113.45999145507812	218.27294921875	10.02001953125	410.8700256347656	90

Priority Setting. Perhaps the fundamental strategy for meta-governance is establishing	113.45999908447266	264.825927734375	10.2916259765625	411.0504379272461	91
priorities, and establishing them politically. A fundamental weakness in the network and other	113.46000671386719	280.366943359375	10.02001953125	410.95216369628906	91
decentered forms of governing is that all programs and goals are virtually equal. This	113.45999145507812	295.84783935546875	10.02001953125	410.8771057128906	91
equality is largely a function of delegating authority to organizations, all of whom presume	113.45999145507812	311.3287353515625	10.02001953125	410.9701843261719	91
that their programs are at least as valuable as everyone else’s program. Likewise, even if the	113.45999145507812	326.8697509765625	10.02001953125	411.0905456542969	91

they still assume that they have been granted that autonomy in order to pursue their own	113.45999145507812	357.8315734863281	10.019989013671875	411.0184020996094	91
goals, rather than any more comprehensive goals for the “Whole of Government”.13	113.45999145507812	371.06195068359375	12.33062744140625	367.86187744140625	91
Priority setting can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Most involve enhancing the	113.45980072021484	404.4463806152344	10.019989013671875	411.0524673461914	92
capacity of presidents, prime ministers and their central agencies. This need to strengthen	113.45980834960938	419.9272766113281	10.019989013671875	410.9322814941406	92
the center may appear somewhat ironic, given the tendency of parliamentary regimes to	113.45980834960938	435.4682922363281	10.019989013671875	410.9602355957031	92
discuss the “presidentialization” of politics, but the focus on the chief executive is often more	113.45980834960938	450.9491882324219	10.019989013671875	411.0373840332031	92
a media event than a reflection of the capacity for governance (Peters, 2007). There are	113.45979309082031	466.4300842285156	10.019989013671875	411.0294647216797	92
some real attempts to strengthen the center and establish priorities. For example, the	113.44979858398438	481.9710998535156	10.019989013671875	411.0344543457031	92
Finnish government now creates several cross-cutting programs as components of the	113.44979858398438	497.4519958496094	10.019989013671875	411.0403747558594	92
coalition documents for each new government (Bouckaert, Ormond and Peters, 2000). Other	113.44979858398438	512.932861328125	10.019989013671875	410.9763488769531	92
governments have attempted to restore some capacity to govern from the center (Savoie,	113.44979858398438	528.473876953125	10.019989013671875	411.0344543457031	92

Soft Law. If conventional uses of authority are not appropriate for the tasks of meta-	113.45999908447266	590.5662231445312	10.291656494140625	410.96431732177734	93
governance then some “softer” alternatives may be the necessary response. The shift to soft	113.47001647949219	606.047119140625	10.020004272460938	411.04847717285156	93
law has been evident not just for meta-governance but like other elements of new	113.47001647949219	621.5280151367188	10.020004272460938	410.9893341064453	93
governance has been applied to a range of situations (Morth, 2003). The basic notion of this	113.47000122070312	637.0690307617188	10.020004272460938	410.9432067871094	93
approach to governing has been to use instruments such as benchmarks, guidelines,	113.47000122070312	652.5499267578125	10.020004272460938	410.8871765136719	93
frameworks, and a host of other mechanisms that establish ranges of compliance rather than	113.47000122070312	668.0308227539062	10.020004272460938	411.0514831542969	93
13 This term has been used by the Australian government and several other national governments to indicate the	113.45999908447266	713.9557495117188	9.732498168945312	410.9207992553711	94
importance of creating more comprehensive approaches to governing. Even in those cases, however, the links to	113.45785522460938	726.7445678710938	7.9799957275390625	410.8790588378906	94
private sector organizations, and even sub-national governments, delivering public services often are not	113.45787048339844	737.72509765625	7.9799957275390625	410.88380432128906	94
adequately institutionalized.	113.45787048339844	748.70556640625	7.9799957275390625	98.32000732421875	94

specific points of compliance. Further, these instruments tend to be the products of	70.91999816894531	109.7259521484375	10.02001953125	411.09056091308594	96

The nature of soft law is to establish ranges of compliance and provide direction rather than	70.91999816894531	156.34600830078125	10.02001953125	411.0404510498047	97
command action. This response to the meta-governance problem reflects the need to steer	70.91999816894531	171.826904296875	10.02001953125	411.0164031982422	97
but continue to do so at a distance, allowing a range of responses from networks, or local	70.91999816894531	187.367919921875	10.02001953125	411.0725555419922	97
governments. The “softness” of the law may vary depending upon the object of the steering.	70.91999816894531	202.84881591796875	10.02001953125	411.03346252441406	97

controls over organizations and networks. For actors at the center, however, reducing levels	70.92001342773438	379.4272766113281	10.019989013671875	410.9593200683594	99
of control may not mean totally abandoning it, and some means of control may still be	70.92001342773438	394.9682922363281	10.019989013671875	411.033447265625	99
maintained while simultaneously permitting autonomy in other areas of activity. Indeed, one	70.92002868652344	410.4491882324219	10.019989013671875	411.0334014892578	99
of the more interesting aspects of the contemporary discussions about autonomy and control	70.92002868652344	425.9300842285156	10.019989013671875	411.0474395751953	99

agencies, quangos and sub-national governments to whom substantial autonomy has been	70.92001342773438	456.9519958496094	10.019989013671875	410.9493408203125	99
granted, at least in theory (see Yesilkagit, 2007).	70.92001342773438	472.4328918457031	10.019989013671875	213.35885620117188	99
Analytically, we (Bouckaert, Peters and Verhoest, 2007) have elsewhere discussed the	70.91999816894531	503.5660705566406	10.019989013671875	411.0273895263672	100
autonomy of public organizations as involving three substantive dimensions – financial,	70.91999816894531	519.0469970703125	10.019989013671875	410.9983367919922	100
human resources and policy. Thus, an organization may be given the latitude to make its	70.91998291015625	534.52783203125	10.019989013671875	410.9663391113281	100
own decisions about personnel and about spending, but the center may retain control over	70.91998291015625	550.06884765625	10.019989013671875	411.00732421875	100
the policy choices of the organization. The available evidence, albeit generally not expressed	70.91996765136719	565.5498046875	10.019989013671875	410.9943084716797	100
in terms of meta-governance, is that central governments tend to maintain the financial purse	70.91996765136719	581.0306396484375	10.019989013671875	411.03846740722656	100
strings and use those to ensure adequate compliance along other dimensions of activity	70.91996765136719	596.5716552734375	10.020004272460938	410.9563751220703	100
(Wanna, Jensen and De Vries, 2004). As well as varying substantively, the maintenance of	70.91996765136719	612.0525512695312	10.020004272460938	411.02638244628906	100
controls from the center may also be strategic or operational. That is, the control	70.91996765136719	627.533447265625	10.020004272460938	410.9842987060547	100
organizations may attempt to either control the frame of action of the (presumably)	70.91996765136719	643.074462890625	10.020004272460938	410.92616271972656	100
autonomous organizations or they may attempt more direct management of the day-to-day	70.91996765136719	658.5553588867188	10.020004272460938	410.91209411621094	100
decisions made by the organizations. The former may more clearly approximate the logic of	70.91996765136719	674.0362548828125	10.020004272460938	410.9612579345703	100

“steering at a distance”, but both represent some diminution of the real autonomy of the	113.45999908447266	109.726318359375	10.02001953125	410.9211654663086	103

The point of this discussion is that autonomy and control may not be as incompatible in	113.45999908447266	156.346435546875	10.02001953125	410.91316986083984	104
practice as they may appear conceptually. The logic of meta-governance, and the “knitting”	113.45999908447266	171.82733154296875	10.02001953125	411.04842376708984	104
to which I alluded above, is that both these concepts must co-exist, and are beginning to co-	113.46000671386719	187.36834716796875	10.02001953125	410.96437072753906	104
exist more effectively, within contemporary political systems. As argued concerning the	113.46002197265625	202.8492431640625	10.02001953125	410.98736572265625	104
utilization of soft law as an instrument for meta-governance, the actual mixture of autonomy	113.46002197265625	218.33013916015625	10.02001953125	410.995361328125	104
and control is likely to be contingent, and may also be dependent upon the particular political	113.46002197265625	233.87115478515625	10.02001953125	411.08648681640625	104
system. The task for both the academic analyst and the practitioner is to identify mixtures	113.46000671386719	249.35205078125	10.02001953125	410.9462432861328	104
that can at once deliver effective political (democratic) control and maintain the efficiency	113.45999145507812	264.83294677734375	10.02001953125	411.0154113769531	104
gains that appear to have resulted from many of the NPM reforms. To square this circle	113.45999145507812	280.37396240234375	10.02001953125	411.0254211425781	104
maintaining one or a few primary controls, usually the budget, may be an effective strategy	113.45999145507812	295.8548583984375	10.02001953125	410.9502868652344	104
for meta-governance.	113.45999145507812	311.33575439453125	10.02001953125	94.91744995117188	104

Finally, the increasing use of performance management in almost all developed	113.45999908447266	394.96636962890625	10.019989013671875	410.99019622802734	106
democracies, and many other systems, provides a means of controlling potentially	113.45999908447266	410.447265625	10.019989013671875	410.98836517333984	106
autonomous organizations (see OECD, 2007; Peters, 2007). Although the term may be used	113.46000671386719	425.92816162109375	10.019989013671875	411.0233917236328	106
in a variety of ways, the fundamental idea is that by using measurable targets for the results	113.46000671386719	441.46917724609375	10.019989013671875	410.8740997314453	106
of public programs central control organizations can monitor and control the behavior of	113.46000671386719	456.9500732421875	10.019989013671875	411.0545196533203	106
those organizations. This technique therefore shifts the mantra of New Public Management	113.46002197265625	472.43096923828125	10.019989013671875	411.060546875	106
from “let the managers manage” to “make the managers manage”, meaning that some of the	113.46002197265625	487.97198486328125	10.019989013671875	410.845947265625	106
latitude inherent in the management ideas of NPM has been lost in favor of mandates to	113.46002197265625	503.4529113769531	10.019989013671875	411.12451171875	106
managers.	113.46000671386719	518.9337158203125	10.019989013671875	47.28437805175781	106
Performance management has some attributes in common with soft law as an instrument for	113.45999908447266	550.06591796875	10.019989013671875	410.9392318725586	107
meta-governance. In particular, this method relies on negotiating frameworks and contracts	113.45999908447266	565.546875	10.019989013671875	411.0013656616211	107
to impose control over the organizations delivering services, as well as the individuals	113.45999145507812	581.0277099609375	10.019989013671875	410.9963073730469	107
involved in those programs. The targets that are established in performance management	113.45999145507812	596.5687255859375	10.020004272460938	410.9311828613281	107
tend to be flexible, or tend to be progressive, so that the steering is rather “soft”, and permit	113.45997619628906	612.0496826171875	10.020004272460938	410.93724060058594	107
the organizations involved to have some latitude in how they reach the performance targets.	113.45997619628906	627.530517578125	10.020004272460938	410.9763641357422	107
In addition, levels of compliance tend to be progressive so that the levels at which any	113.45997619628906	643.071533203125	10.020004272460938	410.9833221435547	107
organization must perform tend to be negotiated year after year, with some continuing ability	113.4599609375	658.552490234375	10.020004272460938	410.98431396484375	107
to affect the outcomes of performance management.	113.4599609375	674.0333251953125	10.020004272460938	232.0972900390625	107
Performance management can help to solve several of the problems created by earlier	113.45999908447266	705.16552734375	10.020004272460938	410.9803695678711	108
reforms of the public sector. For example, when performance measurement and	113.46000671386719	720.6464233398438	10.019996643066406	410.9201202392578	108
management are used internally between ministries and their components (including	113.45999145507812	736.1273193359375	10.019996643066406	410.9653015136719	108

perhaps contractors as well as formal institutions within the public sector) they are important	70.91999816894531	109.7259521484375	10.02001953125	411.0264129638672	110
elements of internal management and steering. However, when applied more directly by	70.91998291015625	125.2669677734375	10.02001953125	411.04644775390625	110

management can be a very useful component for accountability. Especially when the	70.91998291015625	156.228759765625	10.02001953125	411.0683288574219	110

well as for establishing general democratic frameworks for action.	70.91996765136719	187.25067138671875	10.02001953125	289.40272521972656	110

Governance has been and continues to be a scarce commodity in most countries. In many	70.91999816894531	270.82635498046875	10.02001953125	410.9823455810547	112
ways the capacity to govern has been enhanced significantly over the past several decades	70.92001342773438	286.36737060546875	10.02001953125	410.9413146972656	112
through the spread of the ideas of both New Public Management and the ideas of	70.9200439453125	301.8482666015625	10.02001953125	411.0104064941406	112
governance. These approaches to governing both tended to enhance the autonomy of lower	70.9200439453125	317.32916259765625	10.02001953125	411.0303955078125	112
level components of the governing system, whether sub-national governments, agencies, or	70.9200439453125	332.8702087402344	10.019989013671875	410.96136474609375	112
networks linking public and private actors. The capacity of organizations to make more of	70.9200439453125	348.3511047363281	10.019989013671875	410.9804382324219	112
their own choices, and the capacity to employ management techniques not familiar to the	70.9200439453125	363.8320007324219	10.019989013671875	410.98431396484375	112
public sector, have tended to make government more efficient and effective in service	70.92005920410156	379.3730163574219	10.019989013671875	411.01634216308594	112
delivery.	70.92005920410156	394.8539123535156	10.019989013671875	36.55296325683594	112
Despite the successes of many aspects of reform in the public sector, the problems of	70.91999816894531	425.92596435546875	10.019989013671875	410.98036193847656	113
accountability and control that were inherent in these reforms have engendered a	70.91999816894531	441.46697998046875	10.019989013671875	411.0314178466797	113
subsequent round of change. Although it is impossible to return to the governance models	70.91998291015625	456.9478759765625	10.019989013671875	410.996337890625	113
that were the object of the NPM and “governance” reforms, some mechanisms for	70.91998291015625	472.42877197265625	10.019989013671875	410.96734619140625	113
addressing the accountability and other fundamental democratic issues raised by the first	70.91998291015625	487.96978759765625	10.019989013671875	411.07647705078125	113
round of reforms are required. The perceived negative consequences of reforms have	70.91998291015625	503.4507141113281	10.019989013671875	411.14666748046875	113
produced some new types of governing, discussed here as “meta-governance”.	70.91998291015625	518.9315185546875	10.019989013671875	350.53570556640625	113
The primary governance task, as outlined in this paper, therefore is to knit together these two	70.91999816894531	550.0657958984375	10.019989013671875	411.1988067626953	114
strands of change in the public sector. While the one strand represents the efficiency drives	70.92001342773438	565.546630859375	10.019989013671875	410.9823303222656	114
of governing, the other tends to represent better the political, and especially democratic,	70.92001342773438	581.027587890625	10.019989013671875	411.07049560546875	114
aspirations for governing. The fundamental point here is that these two can be knit together	70.92001342773438	596.5685424804688	10.020004272460938	411.01837158203125	114
effectively, but that the knitting will depend upon a number of contingent factors. The first	70.92001342773438	612.0494384765625	10.020004272460938	411.0213928222656	114
rounds of reform (and especially NPM) tended to assume that one size fit all, but the ability	70.92002868652344	627.5303344726562	10.020004272460938	410.9683074951172	114
to use management techniques as well as the types of meta-governance that are viable are	70.92001342773438	643.0713500976562	10.020004272460938	411.054443359375	114
dependent upon a number of political and policy factors that require additional explication.	70.92001342773438	658.55224609375	10.020004272460938	411.0063171386719	114
Thus, the task of coping with governance will continue to require extensive research and	70.92001342773438	674.0331420898438	10.020004272460938	411.05145263671875	114
