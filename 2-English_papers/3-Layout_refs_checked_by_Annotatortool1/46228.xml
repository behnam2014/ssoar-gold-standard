This article discusses some pivotal questions regarding processes of the intergenerational	113.39999389648438	360.5946044921875	8.519989013671875	354.3766174316406	19

cesses provide resources that foster agency, and to what extent do they rather constitute	113.39999389648438	380.5748596191406	8.519989013671875	354.3417053222656	19
barriers to living one’s own life? How much do intergenerational relations allow for cer-	113.39999389648438	390.5952453613281	8.519989013671875	354.3782958984375	19
tain reinterpretations while discouraging or inhibiting others? Which reinterpretations of	113.39999389648438	400.6156311035156	8.519989013671875	354.30755615234375	19
the older generations’ experiences appear legitimate in certain contexts, and which are	113.39999389648438	410.57550048828125	8.519989013671875	354.2700500488281	19

In order to pursue these questions we present analyses of two very different cases that	124.74181365966797	430.61627197265625	8.519989013671875	343.0646438598633	19
are based on two forms of data material – the life story of Emma, a woman in her 50s,	113.39999389648438	440.5761413574219	8.519989013671875	354.4226379394531	19
and ethno-analytic group interviews with adolescents aged 14 to 20. Both cases are em-	113.39999389648438	450.5965270996094	8.519989013671875	354.36041259765625	19
bedded in very different regional and political contexts: the former, in the French system	113.39999389648438	460.6169128417969	8.519989013671875	354.29229736328125	19

pected dynamics regarding the questions outlined above. We present two cases of	113.4000244140625	324.66876220703125	9.47998046875	354.3719177246094	31

can be called precarious environments, albeit in very different contexts: the	113.40036010742188	346.6900634765625	9.47998046875	354.345458984375	31

both cases, the previous generation had migrated before our interviewees were	113.40036010742188	368.6495361328125	9.47998046875	354.3425598144531	31

than in this aspect: the data material consists in the first case of an individual bi-	113.40034484863281	423.6695556640625	9.47998046875	354.32252502441406	31

over, the interviewees are of a very different age at the time of the interview: in	113.40034484863281	445.689697265625	9.47998046875	354.27320861816406	31

Given that our cases differ in a variety of aspects, our idea is not to compare	124.74031829833984	478.6895751953125	9.47998046875	342.93814849853516	31
our two cases in the strict sense, but rather to discuss them in their similarities	113.40034484863281	489.6693115234375	9.47998046875	354.3805694580078	31
and differences regarding processes of intergenerational transmission. This point	113.40034484863281	500.6490478515625	9.47998046875	354.39744567871094	31
of view allows us to understand the “how” rather than the “why” (Becker 1998)	113.40034484863281	511.689453125	9.47998046875	354.34913635253906	31
and to gain an understanding of the processes that are in the background of our	113.40034484863281	522.669189453125	9.47998046875	354.33009338378906	31
two cases of intergenerational transmission in a precarious environment.	113.40034484863281	533.64892578125	9.47998046875	313.7130584716797	31
Furthermore, discussing these two cases side by side was at first merely helpful	124.74031829833984	544.6893310546875	9.47998046875	342.9976272583008	31
for finding out more about each respective individual case. But we soon realized	113.40034484863281	555.6690673828125	9.47998046875	354.2268829345703	31
that both cases have more in common than one would suspect at first sight by as-	113.40034484863281	566.6488037109375	9.47998046875	354.4127655029297	31

namics and differences of both cases. However, we are aware that this discussion	113.40034484863281	599.648681640625	9.479995727539062	354.49232482910156	31
is testing the limits of casing and comparing. Therefore, in the conclusion (4) we	113.40034484863281	610.6890869140625	9.479995727539062	354.3405303955078	31

and outline the general research question and methodology.	113.4000015258789	270.6695556640625	9.47998046875	257.1449508666992	35

By interviewing adults who were fostered during their childhood and adolescence,	113.4000015258789	331.68963623046875	9.47998046875	354.4866256713867	37
Sarra Chaïeb’s research tries to understand how members of ethnic or religious	113.4000015258789	342.66937255859375	9.47998046875	354.34825897216797	37
minority groups experienced their placement in two child protection organizations	113.4000015258789	353.64910888671875	9.47998046875	354.39928436279297	37
that are historically characterized by religion (Judaism and Catholicism). On the	113.4000015258789	364.68951416015625	9.47998046875	354.4571762084961	37
one hand, she asks how the two care institutions impact people’s life courses and	113.4000015258789	375.66925048828125	9.47998046875	354.29244232177734	37
their sense of belonging, in regard to the socialization in their families. On the	113.4000015258789	386.64898681640625	9.47998046875	354.3481674194336	37
other hand, based on interviews with professionals, she explores how individuals	113.39999389648438	397.68939208984375	9.47998046875	354.4251403808594	37
and also groups of individuals – groups of migrants, for example – influence or	113.39999389648438	408.66912841796875	9.47998046875	354.2201843261719	37
have influenced the evolution of the boundaries and the professional practices of	113.39999389648438	419.64886474609375	9.47998046875	354.25811767578125	37
these organizations. The interview with Emma2 was one of those conducted in the	113.39999389648438	430.68927001953125	9.4803466796875	354.27557373046875	37
exploratory phase of this research, and is one which exposes the main topics that	113.400390625	441.66937255859375	9.47998046875	354.3699645996094	37
also emerged throughout the subsequent interviews: the sense of belonging, the	113.400390625	452.64910888671875	9.47998046875	354.3812561035156	37

The importance of this question is underlined by the growing concern regarding	113.40017700195312	485.6493835449219	9.480010986328125	354.342529296875	37

been broached by French research (Gheorghiu 2002). We try to understand the	113.39968872070312	617.649169921875	9.479995727539062	354.3691101074219	37
way in which people see their placement trajectory after they have left care, to see	113.39970397949219	628.6895751953125	9.479995727539062	354.2836151123047	37
how they have structured themselves in this context, in which resources they have	113.39970397949219	639.6693115234375	9.479995727539062	354.3102569580078	37

terpretations are thus based on their related memory. Using life stories seems to	113.39970397949219	672.669189453125	9.479995727539062	354.34996032714844	37

Concerning the institutional situation, it seems obvious that the family, after a	124.7399673461914	225.66912841796875	9.47998046875	343.03466033935547	40

ization and intergenerational transmission anymore. Instead, the fostering insti-	113.39999389648438	247.68927001953125	9.47998046875	354.2485656738281	40

youths. This idea leads to more questions: in the context of fostering, is there a	113.39999389648438	269.64874267578125	9.47998046875	354.3671875	40
sort of institutional intergenerational transmission, too? Does the transmission	113.39999389648438	280.68914794921875	9.47998046875	354.3179016113281	40
necessarily come from the family? What about the “plural kinship” (Cadoret 1995)	113.39999389648438	291.66888427734375	9.47998046875	354.3186340332031	40
in the framework of foster care? In our case, and referring to the conceptual con-	113.39999389648438	302.64862060546875	9.47998046875	354.4164123535156	40
siderations above, one might ask, which are the contents of intergenerational	113.39999389648438	313.68902587890625	9.47998046875	354.29888916015625	40
transmission that are appropriated by Emma? What would parents transmit to	113.39999389648438	324.66876220703125	9.47998046875	354.3103332519531	40
their children in a context of fostering? What is the link between transmission and	113.39999389648438	335.64849853515625	9.47998046875	354.3246154785156	40
re-appropriation in this case? These dimensions can be considered regarding the	113.39997863769531	346.68890380859375	9.47998046875	354.3975067138672	40
conflict and/or the idea of “plural socialization” (Lahire 1998) that foster children	113.39997863769531	357.66864013671875	9.47998046875	354.30445861816406	40

Her mother did not intervene, as a result of which Emma felt betrayed by her. The	113.39999389648438	566.6485595703125	9.480010986328125	354.49969482421875	42
successive pregnancies of her mother led to Emma’s frequent fostering, and by the	113.39999389648438	577.6890258789062	9.479995727539062	354.43719482421875	42

From the age of 10 to 14 years, Emma lived in a placement institution. At the	124.7399673461914	610.6889038085938	9.479995727539062	342.99474334716797	42

But now, as an adolescent, she decided to press charges against him. In the trial,	113.39999389648438	643.6887817382812	9.479995727539062	354.405029296875	42
her father was sentenced to 30 years in prison, whereas she was transferred to	113.39999389648438	654.6685180664062	9.479995727539062	354.33392333984375	42

tempted suicide, but survived. Her later meeting with a social worker allowed her	113.4000015258789	159.66937255859375	9.47998046875	354.3282699584961	45
to find a job. Later on she returned to school and graduated in nursing in 1980.	113.4000015258789	170.64910888671875	9.47998046875	339.13082122802734	45
2.1.2 The transmission viewed as a constraint during fostering	113.4000015258789	192.73931884765625	9.47998046875	266.83345794677734	46
In Emma’s case, the difficulty concerning intergenerational transmission seems to	113.4000015258789	212.6492919921875	9.47998046875	354.3425521850586	47
be situated on two main levels: firstly, her story raises the question whether, in-	113.4000015258789	223.689697265625	9.47998046875	354.5055160522461	47
side her family, a family memory was actually developed and passed on. Secondly,	113.4000015258789	234.66943359375	9.47998046875	354.3073959350586	47
which elements could be reinterpreted to keep a trace, an inheritance in this cha-	113.4000015258789	245.649169921875	9.47998046875	354.33580780029297	47
otic life course?	113.4000015258789	256.6895751953125	9.47998046875	65.51343536376953	47
For a long time, Emma was ashamed of her family and of where she came from.	124.73997497558594	267.6693115234375	9.47998046875	343.0110321044922	47
At the beginning, all the suffering that her parents subjected her to did not allow	113.4000015258789	278.6490478515625	9.47998046875	354.2676315307617	47
her to refer to her family in any positive way. For Emma, everything seemed to be	113.4000015258789	289.689453125	9.47998046875	354.26280975341797	47
negative and destructive.	113.4000015258789	300.669189453125	9.47998046875	108.54219818115234	47
Emma: And after all these questions, there is everything that goes into pieces, and you	113.4000015258789	316.6142578125	8.65216064453125	354.3877182006836	48
ask yourself “Why all this?” You don’t want to be a victim, you say to yourself,	147.4195098876953	326.5740966796875	8.519989013671875	320.4031524658203	48
“I’m sick of all that, I have to assume,” but you’re always ashamed, it’s very	147.4195098876953	336.594482421875	8.519989013671875	320.35108947753906	48
strong. I was sometimes making up a story, not to say where I come from. I was	147.4195098876953	346.6148681640625	8.519989013671875	320.3179473876953	48
tempted to believe that my father was a big man in the army, that my mother	147.4195098876953	356.5747375488281	8.519989013671875	320.29917907714844	48
was the daughter of a tribal chief, you know, just for fun, to think that they were	147.4195098876953	366.5951232910156	8.519989013671875	320.4380340576172	48
nice people… After that, I told myself that it wasn’t the point, anyway I would	147.4195098876953	376.6155090332031	8.519989013671875	320.2890167236328	48
never be like that.	147.4195098876953	386.57537841796875	8.519989013671875	71.59358215332031	48
Here Emma expresses the shame she felt, and explains the temptation of trying to	113.4000015258789	401.649658203125	9.47998046875	354.3347396850586	49
fend off this shame. This period seems to be difficult for her; she does not want to	113.4000015258789	412.6900634765625	9.47998046875	354.3879928588867	49
be in the line of her parents’ descent. But even though the negligence, mistreat-	113.4000015258789	423.6697998046875	9.47998046875	354.2865219116211	49
ment and violence she experienced from her parents reappear in Emma’s memory,	113.4000015258789	434.6495361328125	9.47998046875	354.30077362060547	49
she later on developed something in common with them, some specific memories	113.4000015258789	445.68994140625	9.47998046875	354.3849105834961	49
which are mentioned in her talks. A part of what has been passed on to her was	113.4000015258789	456.669677734375	9.47998046875	354.41259002685547	49
hard to accept for a while: her face, first name and surname are visible traces of	113.40000915527344	467.6494140625	9.47998046875	354.40220642089844	49
what she represents for people. We can see in this interview extract that Emma	113.40000915527344	478.6898193359375	9.47998046875	354.32154846191406	49
had experiences of racist discrimination at different moments in her life course.	113.40000915527344	489.6695556640625	9.47998046875	354.3044891357422	49
The differentiated treatment (Cossée/Lada/Rigoni 2004; Chaïeb/Cossée 2013) she	113.40000915527344	500.6492919921875	9.47998046875	354.39002990722656	49
was confronted with – to be considered just as Arab while she just wanted to be	113.40000915527344	511.689697265625	9.47998046875	354.3319549560547	49
“as the other,” – can partially explain the reason why Emma has so much difficul-	113.40000915527344	522.66943359375	9.47998046875	354.30162048339844	49
ty to accept herself as Arab.	113.40000915527344	533.649169921875	9.47998046875	119.26698303222656	49
Emma: […] it’s true, I always loved my job, it was all I could do to prove to humanity	113.4000015258789	549.5941162109375	8.652191162109375	354.35363006591797	50
that I could do something good, because during all this time, even during the in-	147.4195098876953	559.614501953125	8.519989013671875	320.36827087402344	50
ternships, people considered me a dirty Arab. In so far that I sometimes treat	147.4195098876953	569.5743408203125	8.519989013671875	320.2259063720703	50
myself as a dirty Arab too although I never recognized myself as Arab. Quickly I	147.4195098876953	579.5947265625	8.519989013671875	320.2941131591797	50
changed my first name, when they asked where I come from. I couldn’t say that I	147.4195098876953	589.6151123046875	8.520004272460938	320.3519744873047	50
was Tunisian, because for me it was the reflection of my father and my mother	147.4195098876953	599.574951171875	8.520004272460938	320.39878845214844	50
[…] But it’s true that I was thinking that maybe on my deathbed I will find the	147.4195098876953	609.5953369140625	8.520004272460938	320.34095764160156	50
courage to take my maiden name again and use it with pride.	147.4195098876953	619.61572265625	8.520004272460938	241.18247985839844	50
Thus, Emma sent a strong signal by changing her name and gaining some dis-	113.4000015258789	634.689697265625	9.479995727539062	354.3206100463867	51
tance from her family history. After that, she explains the joy she felt when she	113.4000015258789	645.66943359375	9.479995727539062	354.3709030151367	51
took her husband’s name, which made her life easier, in particular when she was	113.4000015258789	656.649169921875	9.479995727539062	354.3074264526367	51
looking for a job. She felt protected from people’s opinions but also from what she	113.4000015258789	667.6895751953125	9.479995727539062	354.31700897216797	51
disclosed about herself. Emma did not recognize herself in other people’s regard	113.4000015258789	678.6693115234375	9.479995727539062	354.50838470458984	51
and could not consider herself as a part of her parents’ cultural origin.	113.40000915527344	689.6490478515625	9.479995727539062	300.4353790283203	51
S. Chaieb, C. H. Schwarz: Intergenerational transmission of trajectories	113.4000015258789	120.29425048828125	8.51995849609375	275.7071762084961	52

The question of her parents’ origin seems to be one of the most important and	124.73999786376953	148.68963623046875	9.47998046875	342.9730758666992	54
strong issues for Emma because it is central to her identity construction and her	113.40000915527344	159.66937255859375	9.47998046875	354.45811462402344	54
relation to others. It is impossible to override this set of problems, precisely for	113.40000915527344	170.64910888671875	9.47998046875	354.38890075683594	54
these two reasons. But how could one feel engaged in a positive intergenerational	113.40000915527344	181.68951416015625	9.47998046875	354.37757873535156	54
relation with one’s parents, their values, traditions and general cultural frame,	113.40000915527344	192.66925048828125	9.47998046875	354.4790802001953	54
when these elements are distorted by a violent climate of mistreatment? Emma’s	113.40000915527344	203.64898681640625	9.47998046875	354.3273162841797	54
speech reflects this ambivalence very well: on the one hand, the paradox consists	113.40000915527344	214.68939208984375	9.47998046875	354.3056182861328	54
in dismissing the elements that could lead to her origins, because she does not	113.40000915527344	225.66912841796875	9.47998046875	354.34251403808594	54
identify with them. On the other hand, she describes a possible “return to origins”	113.40000915527344	236.64886474609375	9.47998046875	354.4059600830078	54
– in this case reverting to her real first name – as an act of bravery.	113.40000915527344	247.68927001953125	9.47998046875	289.5712432861328	54
2.1.3 The re-interpretation of fostering as a strategy to link with family	113.40000915527344	269.7197265625	9.47998046875	306.78794860839844	55
transmission	136.0799560546875	280.7601318359375	9.47998046875	53.71844482421875	55
In Emma’s case, there seem to be two main aspects which come into play when	113.40000915527344	302.6505126953125	9.47998046875	354.37294006347656	56
she reinterprets what has been passed on: time and the necessity to draft her own	113.40000915527344	313.69091796875	9.47998046875	354.26087951660156	56
life and her concept of self. Emma needed time to take a different look at how she	113.40000915527344	324.670654296875	9.47998046875	354.37770080566406	56
suffered, and building her own family was significant for the reinterpretation of	113.40000915527344	335.650390625	9.47998046875	354.30079650878906	56
her life course. Studies on fostering often deal with the dimension of time: the	113.40000915527344	346.6907958984375	9.47998046875	354.37379455566406	56
more time has passed after leaving the care institution, the more people can take	113.40000915527344	357.6705322265625	9.47998046875	354.41819763183594	56
a global view on their fostering and develop resilience (Frechon/Dumaret 2008, p.	113.4000244140625	368.6502685546875	9.47998046875	354.3406677246094	56

Time is indeed an important factor in the interpretation of events that punctu-	124.73999786376953	390.67041015625	9.47998046875	342.9758834838867	56
ated her life, and Emma succeeds in describing her life course from a positive	113.4000244140625	401.650146484375	9.47998046875	354.3662109375	56
point of view despite what she went through. For a long time, Emma felt resent-	113.4000244140625	412.6905517578125	9.47998046875	354.321533203125	56
ment against her mother. Later, however, she speaks about the mother-daughter	113.4000244140625	423.6702880859375	9.47998046875	354.19256591796875	56
relationship as not very developed, but as playing an important role in her life	113.4000244140625	434.6500244140625	9.47998046875	354.40411376953125	56
course and the tenacity she found in herself:	113.40003967285156	445.6904296875	9.47998046875	189.8824920654297	56
Emma: I arrived after a tragedy, it was hard, but I hope… I think that she loved me. I	113.4000015258789	462.5942077636719	8.65216064453125	354.2804183959961	57
don’t know if she wanted me but nevertheless she took me in her arms. I think	147.4195098876953	472.6145935058594	8.519989013671875	320.3920440673828	57
that someone who copes, who isn’t mentally ill, who doesn’t commit suicide,	147.4195098876953	482.574462890625	8.519989013671875	320.28306579589844	57
maybe such a person was, for the two or three first years of her life, touched,	147.4195098876953	492.5948486328125	8.519989013671875	320.3085479736328	57
kissed, liked… for me, if you had that, you can come to terms with all uproar, you	147.4195098876953	502.615234375	8.519989013671875	320.26087951660156	57
will always be better off than someone who didn’t have that.	147.4195098876953	512.5750732421875	8.519989013671875	236.56126403808594	57
Here Emma manages to point out the positive elements that her parents passed	113.4000015258789	528.669677734375	9.480010986328125	354.3607406616211	58
on to her, or at least she can see something positive in these elements. According	113.4000015258789	539.6494140625	9.480010986328125	354.3198776245117	58

In Emma’s life course, the transmission and reflexivity functions go together,	124.7399673461914	192.66925048828125	9.47998046875	342.9267807006836	61

in the comprehension of this family story. For her, there are two steps of recon-	113.39999389648438	247.68927001953125	9.47998046875	354.276123046875	61

sons for what happened. The dimension of social supports and/or of people who	113.39999389648438	269.64874267578125	9.47998046875	354.3016662597656	61
play the role of resource in the life course is very important in Emma’s trajectory	113.39999389648438	280.68914794921875	9.47998046875	354.3594055175781	61
as a fostered person (Goyette 2006; Frechon/Goyette 2013). When she was young,	113.39997863769531	291.66888427734375	9.47998046875	354.4097442626953	61
Emma met adults who became significant others, such as her school teacher who	113.39997863769531	302.64862060546875	9.47998046875	354.3025665283203	61
took on an almost maternal relation towards her. The fact that Emma speaks	113.39997863769531	313.68902587890625	9.47998046875	354.34254455566406	61
about her teacher in a vocabulary of love, as the love she did not have from her	113.39997863769531	324.66876220703125	9.47998046875	354.4250946044922	61
mother, might indicate that this relation compensated for some of the lack of af-	113.39997863769531	335.64849853515625	9.47998046875	354.36241149902344	61

Emma desperately seeks information about her parents and their life course.	124.73995208740234	357.66864013671875	9.47998046875	343.0054397583008	61
Paradoxically, it is the very lack of information that increasingly becomes a re-	113.39997863769531	368.64837646484375	9.47998046875	354.34352111816406	61
source for her. After all these years of hatred towards her mother, today Emma	113.39997863769531	379.68878173828125	9.47998046875	354.2753143310547	61

cording to Emma, her mother never had a chance in life: she did not have the	113.39997863769531	401.64825439453125	9.47998046875	354.35475158691406	61
choice to marry or to control her body. Emma defines her life course as a struggle	113.39997863769531	412.68865966796875	9.47998046875	354.42689514160156	61
against injustice, especially against men, and feels involved in a mission:	113.39997863769531	423.66839599609375	9.47998046875	312.63038635253906	61
Emma: […] I am on trial. I had problems with all the men I met in my life… and then I	113.4000015258789	440.57421875	8.65216064453125	354.36385345458984	62

Emma here tackles her female rebellion as the result of a mother-to-daughter	113.4000015258789	496.68963623046875	9.599609375	354.3785934448242	63

priating these experiences herself, applying them to her biographical process, and	113.40000915527344	529.6895141601562	9.47998046875	354.4088897705078	63
striving for continuity. Emma explains everything about her life story, her moth-	113.39999389648438	540.6692504882812	9.47998046875	354.31585693359375	63
er’s difficulty to be a subject of her own life, not just because she did not have in-	113.39999389648438	551.6489868164062	9.47998046875	354.3377990722656	63
tellectual resources, but because she did not have any access to the information	113.39999389648438	562.6893920898438	9.47998046875	354.3453063964844	63
that would have been useful in a precarious social and cultural context. Hence,	113.39999389648438	573.6691284179688	9.47998046875	354.38232421875	63
she theorizes and attributes the basis of this rebellion to her mother. Emma, by	113.39999389648438	584.6488647460938	9.479995727539062	354.31591796875	63

lationships with men in general, we can note that she found such a balance with	113.39997863769531	606.6690063476562	9.479995727539062	354.3415985107422	63

This case illustrates the concept of transmission and allows us to think of this no-	113.4000015258789	194.649658203125	9.47998046875	354.3044967651367	68

shelter to the approximately 750 000 refugees that fled or were expelled during	113.39999389648438	464.64892578125	9.47998046875	354.3330993652344	70
the course of the first Arab-Israeli war, which in Jewish-Israeli discourse is called	113.39999389648438	475.6893310546875	9.47998046875	354.28179931640625	70
the War of Independence, whereas in the Arabic discourse it is referred to by the	113.40000915527344	486.6690673828125	9.599609375	354.4829559326172	70
term Nakba (catastrophe in Arabic) (Sayigh 1979, pp. 6ff.; Bowker 2003, pp. 67ff.).	113.4000015258789	497.6488037109375	9.599609375	354.32360076904297	70
However, using the term “camp” already seems misleading here, as it is usually	113.40000915527344	508.689208984375	9.47998046875	354.4361114501953	70

litical and social paradox that the camp is still defined as a transitory space, and	113.40005493164062	574.68896484375	9.47998046875	354.25909423828125	70

and statements. In contradiction to this, however, there is the everyday individual	113.40007019042969	596.6484375	9.479995727539062	354.3870391845703	70

which finds its expression in the construction of three- or four-story apartment	113.40097045898438	618.6685791015625	9.479995727539062	354.28070068359375	70

The participants in the first group interview were four boys and seven girls	124.73959350585938	401.64898681640625	9.47998046875	343.0451354980469	75

With this explicit reference to the term “generation” she directly located the group	113.39961242675781	456.66900634765625	9.47998046875	354.28172302246094	75

practice; this, in turn, can be interpreted as an indicator of the ubiquity of the	113.4000015258789	148.68963623046875	9.47998046875	354.35472869873047	80

father’s demand, it does not appear as a vocal interaction but as a message that is	113.40000915527344	170.64910888671875	9.47998046875	354.36427307128906	80

transmission. Accordingly, he presents an argumentation: “you have to struggle,	113.40000915527344	192.66925048828125	9.599609375	354.36900329589844	80
you have to do something” because of the fact that they live in a camp, that	113.40097045898438	203.64898681640625	9.47998046875	354.3755187988281	80

– both presumably because of confrontations with the Israeli security forces. How-	113.40097045898438	225.66912841796875	9.47998046875	354.51702880859375	80
ever, although the concrete means of “struggle” to which the group refers are not	113.40097045898438	236.64886474609375	9.47998046875	354.3045959472656	80

This argumentative mode also characterized the following course of the inter-	124.7409439086914	291.66888427734375	9.47998046875	342.91426849365234	80
view, when Maher and Adnan took turns in presenting long statements, talking	113.40097045898438	302.64862060546875	9.47998046875	354.3359375	80
about the general situation at the checkpoints, the imprisonment of minors etc.	113.40097045898438	313.68902587890625	9.47998046875	354.3746032714844	80
Sometimes these statements also referred to their own practice as a dabka group,	113.40098571777344	324.66876220703125	9.599609375	354.4154510498047	80
which the interviewer was able to attend later. In these shows, the youths com-	113.40194702148438	335.64849853515625	9.47998046875	354.275146484375	80
bine folkloric dance and music with theatre playing, but the actors would not ar-	113.40194702148438	346.68890380859375	9.47998046875	354.3851318359375	80

given the performance or the enacted character a more individual or personal	113.40292358398438	368.64837646484375	9.47998046875	354.3235168457031	80
touch. Instead, the narration that went along with the show came from a recorded	113.40292358398438	379.68878173828125	9.47998046875	354.3994445800781	80
CD, just like the music, and the actors would dance and perform to it. The youths	113.40292358398438	390.66851806640625	9.47998046875	354.3776550292969	80
enacted the Nakba and the ongoing political and militant struggle against Israel.	113.40292358398438	401.64825439453125	9.599609375	354.4249572753906	80
Moreover, they enacted the transmission of the mission to “return” from the older	113.40290832519531	412.68865966796875	9.47998046875	354.38218688964844	80
to the younger generation: in the respective scene, one of the actors would die as a	113.40290832519531	423.66839599609375	9.47998046875	354.3206024169922	80

sic – would confer to his son the mission to never give up the land and to fight for	113.40290832519531	445.68853759765625	9.47998046875	354.4287872314453	80
it, stating that it was the most precious and meaningful asset on earth – a mission	113.40290832519531	456.66827392578125	9.47998046875	354.38404846191406	80
the son willingly accepted and re-enacted, with the other actors rising, joining in,	113.40290832519531	467.64801025390625	9.47998046875	354.30934143066406	80
everybody raising their fists.	113.40290832519531	478.68841552734375	9.47998046875	122.98782348632812	80
But in spite of this militant presentation the youths affirmed already in this	124.74288177490234	489.66815185546875	9.47998046875	343.0147171020508	80
first interview that “throwing stones” had not had the desired political effect, but	113.40289306640625	500.64788818359375	9.47998046875	354.4238586425781	80
had only put the youth at risk. In the same vein, Adnan had at one point dis-	113.40289306640625	511.68829345703125	9.47998046875	354.302734375	80
tanced himself explicitly from suicide bombing – “I’m not with them!” he reiterat-	113.40289306640625	522.6680297851562	9.47998046875	354.27215576171875	80
ed twice10 – and declared that their mission as a youth group was to carry on the	113.40289306640625	533.6477661132812	9.48175048828125	354.3466796875	80

gees on an international level; and like this, he added, “the kids” would also “see	113.39956665039062	555.669677734375	9.47998046875	354.373779296875	80
other countries.” In the following he went back to the issue of the tours Yasmeen	113.39956665039062	566.6494140625	9.47998046875	354.2922058105469	80
had mentioned in the beginning of the interview, and put them in a much more	113.39956665039062	577.6898193359375	9.479995727539062	354.4010314941406	80

Adnan: For the new generation everything is, that means11, is changed. In the past you	113.4000015258789	605.0611572265625	9.165130615234375	354.3690719604492	81

is the good thing. Not just to fight, not just to ‒, to ‒, told the people “We need	147.4203643798828	148.61431884765625	8.727294921875	320.29579162597656	84
that, and we need that and we need that.” I changed how the people, they think	147.42039489746094	158.57421875	8.51995849609375	320.3954315185547	84

tion happen again ... maybe I accept and I agree with them. But I must tell them	147.42123413085938	178.6141357421875	8.51995849609375	320.3664245605469	84
there is a lot of ways.	147.42124938964844	188.57403564453125	8.51995849609375	83.41761779785156	84
Maher, in the passage cited earlier, referred to the term “generation” in order to	113.4000015258789	204.669677734375	9.47998046875	354.2903060913086	85
stress the continuity in the process of intergenerational transmission of the strug-	113.4000015258789	215.6494140625	9.47998046875	354.3927536010742	85
gle, whereas Adnan very clearly highlights the differences between generations	113.4000015258789	226.6898193359375	9.47998046875	354.28755950927734	85
when he states that for the new generation, “everything is changed”. He contrasts	113.4000015258789	237.6695556640625	9.47998046875	354.4125289916992	85
“the past”, when one could only fight, to the current situation and to his activities	113.4000015258789	248.6492919921875	9.47998046875	354.37194061279297	85
as a trainer for the dabka troupe. Moreover, he relates an encounter in which, as	113.39999389648438	259.689697265625	9.599609375	354.3975830078125	85
it seems, a president of another cultural center praises and compliments the	113.39904022216797	270.66943359375	9.47998046875	354.41931915283203	85
group for its achievements through their cultural activity and their contribution	113.39904022216797	281.649169921875	9.47998046875	354.2893753051758	85
to the national struggle. However, what starts as a situation of praise and com-	113.39904022216797	292.6895751953125	9.47998046875	354.25904083251953	85
pliment in Adnan’s narration soon turns into an act of argumentative justifica-	113.39904022216797	303.6693115234375	9.47998046875	354.41736602783203	85
tion: When the revolution “happens again,” Adnan has to decide if he “accepts and	113.39904022216797	314.6490478515625	9.47998046875	354.20890045166016	85
agrees with them” (without further explanation who he refers to as “them”). His	113.39904022216797	325.689453125	9.47998046875	354.33289337158203	85
acceptance on principle granted, he argues that “there is a lot of ways,” which he	113.3990478515625	336.669189453125	9.47998046875	354.3821716308594	85
has described before as theatre playing and education. He thereby declares his es-	113.3990478515625	347.64892578125	9.47998046875	354.3955078125	85
sential identification with “the revolution” but at the same time the possibility –	113.3990478515625	358.6893310546875	9.47998046875	354.36981201171875	85
and the individual right – to choose how to support the struggle. Whereas Adnan	113.3990478515625	369.6690673828125	9.599609375	354.31494140625	85
describes the past shortly as a trajectory of suffering – characterized by a loss of	113.3990478515625	380.6488037109375	9.47998046875	354.29791259765625	85
control that leaves no option but “to fight” – the present seems to give more lee-	113.3990478515625	391.689208984375	9.47998046875	354.34246826171875	85
way for strategic reflection. Accordingly, one can assume that dabka serves indeed	113.3990478515625	402.6689453125	9.599609375	354.3377380371094	85
as another form of resistance in the asymmetric conflict with Israel, in the sense	113.3990478515625	413.648681640625	9.47998046875	354.248779296875	85
of claiming a cultural presence and continuity and advocating for the political pro-	113.3990478515625	424.6890869140625	9.47998046875	354.38800048828125	85
ject of “return.” On a psychological level, it might help the youths to deal with po-	113.3990478515625	435.6688232421875	9.47998046875	354.3025817871094	85
litical violence they experienced directly (although none of that is mentioned	113.39997863769531	446.6485595703125	9.47998046875	354.5121307373047	85
here); moreover, it might serve as a means to deal with trajectory experiences of	113.39996337890625	457.68896484375	9.47998046875	354.271240234375	85

lowing paragraph will illustrate in more detail.	113.39994812011719	501.6685791015625	9.47998046875	202.23020935058594	85

In the course of the subsequent interviews, which were conducted without Adnan,	113.39994812011719	545.649169921875	9.480010986328125	354.38136291503906	87
and mostly gender-separated, the youths were willing to talk about more personal	113.39994812011719	556.6895751953125	9.480010986328125	354.31407165527344	87
questions, such as love or familial relations (Schwarz 2012a). Whereas in the first	113.39994812011719	567.6693115234375	9.480010986328125	354.3651580810547	87
interview the camp community was presented as a family-like community show-	113.39994812011719	578.6490478515625	9.479995727539062	354.25328063964844	87

girls soon complained about the sexual repression and social control in the camp,	113.39994812011719	600.669189453125	9.479995727539062	354.36158752441406	87
stating that everybody would gossip and ruin the respective girl’s reputation, and	113.39996337890625	611.64892578125	9.479995727539062	354.3282775878906	87
that parents would react with severe punishment. They namely blamed the more	113.39996337890625	622.6893310546875	9.479995727539062	354.3045654296875	87
conservative or religious factions in the camp as responsible for this situation, and	113.39996337890625	633.6690673828125	9.479995727539062	354.2979736328125	87
described the dabka group and the cultural center as potential spaces in a hostile	113.39996337890625	644.6488037109375	9.599563598632812	354.4116516113281	87
environment, and as the most important places where boys and girls could meet	113.39997863769531	655.689208984375	9.479995727539062	354.34068298339844	87
without being controlled (there are, by the way, hardly any co-educative schools in	113.39997863769531	666.6689453125	9.479995727539062	354.34532165527344	87

In the situation of fostered children in France, the question of transmission is	124.73998260498047	424.689208984375	9.47998046875	342.9987258911133	126
crucial because of the role the institution of care plays, as it replaces the family,	113.40000915527344	435.6689453125	9.47998046875	354.3433380126953	126
and because of the importance of the fostering institution in the life course. In	113.40000915527344	446.648681640625	9.47998046875	354.28929138183594	126

fantasies about the relation to her mother in her early childhood years appear as	113.40000915527344	468.6688232421875	9.47998046875	354.29978942871094	126

volved her in a political struggle for gender equality. Furthermore, some of the	113.40000915527344	512.6484375	9.47998046875	354.40330505371094	126
people who offered social support allowed her to (re-) construct herself. At first	113.39999389648438	523.6888427734375	9.47998046875	354.35491943359375	126

ly by reconstructing her family narrative that Emma was enabled to gain a reflex-	113.39999389648438	556.688720703125	9.599639892578125	354.45343017578125	126

Simultaneously, she engages in a process of politicization of her own case, as she	113.40093994140625	578.648193359375	9.479995727539062	354.275146484375	126

chal oppression, and defines them as the central theme of her life story.	113.40093994140625	600.6683349609375	9.479995727539062	306.5604248046875	126
However, for our discussion, the most important difference between both cases	124.74091339111328	611.6480712890625	9.479995727539062	343.01009368896484	126
seems to be the level of explicitness and grade of symbolization of transmission.	113.40093994140625	622.6884765625	9.479995727539062	354.3558654785156	126
These aspects obviously determine the respective strategies of the interviewees	113.40093994140625	633.668212890625	9.479995727539062	354.3226318359375	126

whereas in the case of the dabka group, the transmitted narrative permeates all	113.40093994140625	666.6680908203125	9.599624633789062	354.2685546875	126

However, the somewhat abstract notion of “appropriation” and case structure	124.73902130126953	460.68939208984375	9.47998046875	343.05269622802734	132

seems that she made use of the research situation as a potential space in order to	113.39903259277344	636.6685180664062	9.479995727539062	354.38426208496094	132

1 It seems obvious that in the two cases discussed here the experiences passed on by the	113.4000015258789	463.6142883300781	8.519989013671875	354.4260482788086	137

However, the aim of this article is not to identify transgenerational traumatization or	124.7401123046875	493.61492919921875	8.519989013671875	343.0561218261719	137
to clinically distinguish between those experiences passed on by the older generation	124.74009704589844	503.5747985839844	8.519989013671875	343.02622985839844	137
and those that were actually experienced by the interviewees themselves. We assume	124.74009704589844	513.59521484375	8.519989013671875	342.97434997558594	137

9 The notion of narratives in this case study is applied in a twofold sense: with reference	113.40007019042969	359.5748596191406	8.519989013671875	354.36305236816406	140

tions and argumentations of the interviewed subjects in the sense of Fritz Schütze	124.74018859863281	379.6156311035156	8.519989013671875	343.0127410888672	140
(1977, 1983) and Gerhard Riemann (1986, 1986). That means, an interviewee’s per-	124.74018859863281	389.57550048828125	8.519989013671875	342.9768524169922	140
sonal, biographical narrative – which can also be the collective narrative of a group of	124.74017333984375	399.59588623046875	8.519989013671875	342.98114013671875	140
interviewees who experienced certain events together – tells personal experiences of	124.74017333984375	409.61627197265625	8.519989013671875	342.98028564453125	140
the subjects. Usually they are told as one-time experiences, that is, they are referred to	124.74017333984375	419.5761413574219	8.519989013671875	342.97857666015625	140
