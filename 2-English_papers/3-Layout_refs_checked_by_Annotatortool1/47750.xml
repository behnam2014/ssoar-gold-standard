Summary: The aim of this paper is an analysis of the categories of evictions, forced migrations and	56.79999923706055	238.0567626953125	12.03985595703125	481.2361946105957	10
internal displacement in the context of international human rights law. Forced migrations and	56.79999923706055	251.8966064453125	12.0	481.27238845825195	10
selected categories of internal displacement are important issues of international human rights law	56.79999923706055	265.6966552734375	12.0	481.57219314575195	10
and international humanitarian law for more than forty years. The UDHR, adopted in 1948, does not	56.79999923706055	279.49664306640625	12.0	481.41606521606445	10
contain any provisions related to forced human mobility and internal displacement. Despite this fact	56.79999923706055	293.296630859375	12.0	481.3444709777832	10
we can mention many important international law regulations focused on citizenship and human	56.79999923706055	307.09661865234375	12.0	481.2361946105957	10
mobility. The growing interest of international community on the above-mentioned issues can be	56.79999923706055	320.89666748046875	12.0	481.51225662231445	10
dated back to the nineties of the last century. First in-depth studies focused on environmentally-	56.79999923706055	334.6966552734375	12.0	481.4041633605957	10
induced displacement and development-induced displacement can be dated back to the seventies	56.79999923706055	348.4966735839844	12.0	481.33220291137695	10
and eighties of the last century. Since nineties we are observing the growing number of published	56.79999923706055	362.2966613769531	12.0	480.80412673950195	10

Piguet and many others. The issues of forced migrations, evictions and internal displacement are	56.79999923706055	389.89666748046875	12.0	481.06816482543945	10
currently very important areas of international cooperation. Presented articles is focused on global	56.79999923706055	403.6966552734375	12.0	481.22429275512695	10

nous observons le nombre croissant de publié sur ces questions, entre autres, par Michael M.	56.79999923706055	624.4966430664062	12.0	481.6081428527832	11

migrations forcées, les expulsions et les déplacements internes sont actuellement des domaines très	56.79999923706055	652.0966796875	12.0	481.15239334106445	11
importants de la coopération internationale. Les articles présentés sont axés sur des estimations	56.79999923706055	665.8966674804688	12.0	481.63237380981445	11

Global Trends in Forced Migrations, Evictions and Internal Displacement:	105.5999984741211	58.65679931640625	12.0	381.12003326416016	12
Internal displacement: While the above stresses two important elements of internal displacement	56.79999923706055	86.26092529296875	12.03570556640625	481.53215408325195	13
(coercion and the domestic/internal movement), it is important to note that, rather than a strict	56.79999923706055	100.09661865234375	12.0	480.96037673950195	13
definition, the Guiding Principles offer "a descriptive identification of the category of persons	56.79999923706055	113.8966064453125	12.0	480.9362678527832	13
whose needs are the concern of the Guiding Principles". In this way, the document "intentionally	56.79999923706055	127.6966552734375	12.0	481.30827713012695	13
steers toward flexibility rather than legal precision" as the words "in particular" indicate that the list	56.79999923706055	141.49664306640625	12.0	481.45232009887695	13
of reasons for displacement is not exhaustive. However, as Erin Mooney has pointed out, "global	56.79999923706055	155.296630859375	12.0	480.99626541137695	13
statistics on internal displacement generally count only IDPs uprooted by conflict and human rights	56.79999923706055	169.09661865234375	12.0	480.96025466918945	13
violations. Moreover, a recent study has recommended that the IDP concept should be defined even	56.79999923706055	182.8966064453125	12.0	481.3561897277832	13
more narrowly, to be limited to persons displaced by violence." Thus, despite the non-exhaustive	56.79999923706055	196.6966552734375	12.0	480.85222244262695	13
reasons of internal displacement, many consider IDPs as those who would be defined as refugees if	56.79999923706055	210.49664306640625	12.0	481.3919563293457	13
they were to cross an international border, hence, the term refugees in all but name is often applied	56.79999923706055	224.296630859375	12.0	480.8760871887207	13
to IDPs. It is very difficult to get accurate figures for IDPs because populations aren't constant. IDPs	56.79999923706055	238.09661865234375	12.0	481.5241584777832	13
may be returning home while others are fleeing, others may periodically return to IDP camps to take	56.79999923706055	251.8966064453125	12.0	481.52421951293945	13
advantage of humanitarian aid. While the case of IDPs in large camps such as those in Darfur,	56.79999923706055	265.6966552734375	12.0	480.8161506652832	13
western Sudan, are relatively well-reported, it is very difficult to assess those IDPs who flee to	56.79999923706055	279.49664306640625	12.0	481.2241096496582	13
larger towns and cities. It is necessary in many instances to supplement official figures with	56.79999923706055	293.296630859375	12.0	481.3083381652832	13
additional information obtained from operational humanitarian organizations on the ground. Thus,	56.79999923706055	307.09661865234375	12.0	481.6923713684082	13
the 24.5 million figure must be treated as an estimate. Additionally, most official figures only	56.79999923706055	320.89666748046875	12.0	481.2001838684082	13
include those displaced by conflict or natural disasters. Development-induced IDPs often are not	56.79999923706055	334.6966552734375	12.0	481.1642951965332	13
included in assessments.	56.79999923706055	348.4966735839844	12.0	117.55200576782227	13
So-called cluster approach constitute an important area of migration studies and research on	92.30000305175781	362.2966613769531	12.0	445.59617614746094	13
internal displacement. The cluster approach designates individual agencies as ‘sector leaders’ to	56.79999923706055	376.0966491699219	12.0	481.6602668762207	13
coordinate operations in specific areas to try to plug those newly identified gaps. The cluster	56.79999923706055	389.89666748046875	12.0	481.39213943481445	13
approach was conceived amid concerns about coordination and capacity that arose from the weak	56.79999923706055	403.6966552734375	12.0	481.47624588012695	13
operational response to the crisis in Darfur in 2004 and 2005, and the critical findings of the	56.79999923706055	417.4966735839844	12.0	481.0201301574707	13
Humanitarian Response Review (HRR) commissioned by the then ERC, Jan Egeland. Egeland	56.79999923706055	431.2966613769531	12.0	481.3321418762207	13
called for strengthening leadership of the sectors, and introduced the concept of "clusters" at	56.79999923706055	445.0966491699219	12.0	481.53618240356445	13
different levels (headquarters, regional, country and operational)’. Unlike the case of refugees, there	56.79999923706055	458.89666748046875	12.0	481.1281623840332	13
is no international treaty which applies specifically to IDPs. Some have advocated re-thinking the	56.79999923706055	472.6966552734375	12.0	481.1403694152832	13
definitions and protections for refugees to apply to IDPs, but so far no solid actions have come to	56.79999923706055	486.4966735839844	12.0	481.30815505981445	13
fruition.IASC Principles deemed it unnecessary to apply the cluster approach to four sectors where	56.79999923706055	500.296630859375	12.0	481.1880989074707	13
no significant gaps were detected: a) food, led by WFP; b) refugees, led by UNHCR; c) education,	56.79999923706055	514.0966796875	12.0	480.88811111450195	13
led by UNICEF; and d) agriculture, led by FAO. The original nine clusters were later expanded to	56.79999923706055	527.8966674804688	12.0	480.8282356262207	13
include agriculture and education.	56.79999923706055	541.6966552734375	12.0	163.18800735473633	13
The cluster approach operates on the global and local levels. At the global level, the	92.30000305175781	555.4967041015625	12.0	445.4403533935547	13
approach is meant to build up capacity in eleven key ‘gap’ areas by developing better surge	56.79999923706055	569.296630859375	12.0	481.58427810668945	13
capacity, ensuring consistent access to appropriately trained technical expertise and enhanced	56.79999923706055	583.0966796875	12.0	481.2121467590332	13

the field level, the cluster approach strengthens the coordination and response capacity by	56.79999923706055	610.6966552734375	12.0	481.6324348449707	13
mobilizing clusters of humanitarian agencies (UN/Red Cross-Red Crescent/IOs/NGOs) to respond	56.79999923706055	624.4966430664062	12.0	481.5241584777832	13
in particular sectors or areas of activity, each cluster having a clearly designated and accountable	56.79999923706055	638.296630859375	12.0	481.1163215637207	13
lead, as agreed by the HC and the Country Team. Designated lead agencies at the global level both	56.79999923706055	652.0966796875	12.0	481.20024490356445	13
participate directly in operations, but also coordinate with and oversee other organizations within	56.79999923706055	665.8966674804688	12.0	481.0682258605957	13
their specific spheres, reporting the results up through a designated chain of command to the ERC at	56.79999923706055	679.6966552734375	12.0	481.38029861450195	13
the summit. However, lead agencies are responsible as ‘providers of last resort’, which represents	56.79999923706055	693.4966430664062	12.0	481.29619216918945	13
the commitment of cluster leads to do their utmost to ensure an adequate and appropriate response	56.79999923706055	707.296630859375	12.0	480.74419021606445	13
in their respective areas of responsibility. The cluster approach was part of a package of reforms	56.79999923706055	721.0966796875	12.0	481.3082160949707	13
accepted by the IASC in December 2005 and subsequently applied in eight chronic humanitarian	56.79999923706055	734.8966674804688	12.0	481.30827713012695	13
crises and six sudden-onset emergencies. However, the reform was originally rolled out and	56.79999923706055	748.6966552734375	12.0	481.58415603637695	13
evaluated in four countries: DRC, Liberia, Somalia and Uganda.	56.79999923706055	762.4966430664062	12.0	308.77214431762695	13
Prevention of forced migrations is another important area of international human rights law.	92.30000305175781	58.6966552734375	12.0	445.72825622558594	14
Forced migration has accompanied persecution, as well as war, throughout human history but has	56.79999923706055	72.49664306640625	12.0	480.99626541137695	14
only become a topic of serious study and discussion relatively recently. This increased attention is	56.79999923706055	86.296630859375	12.0	481.2844123840332	14
the result of greater ease of travel, allowing displaced persons to flee to nations far removed from	56.79999923706055	100.09661865234375	12.0	481.46428298950195	14
their homes, the creation of an international legal structure of human rights, and the realizations that	56.79999923706055	113.8966064453125	12.0	481.23625564575195	14
the destabilizing effects of forced migration, especially in parts of Africa, the Middle East, south	56.79999923706055	127.6966552734375	12.0	481.0081672668457	14
and central Asia, ripple out well beyond the immediate region. Development-induced displacement	56.79999923706055	141.49664306640625	12.0	481.1522102355957	14
can be understood as a subset of forced migration. Such displacement is the forcing of communities	56.79999923706055	155.296630859375	12.0	481.22832107543945	14
and individuals out of their homes, often also their homelands, for the purposes of economic	56.79999923706055	169.09661865234375	12.0	481.38005447387695	14
development, conservation of nature, dams, urbanization, re-urbanization and population	56.79999923706055	182.8966064453125	12.0	481.4522590637207	14

Though the procedures for evictions differ depending on the specific laws of various	92.30000305175781	216.49664306640625	12.0	446.08811950683594	15
jurisdictions, the general process consists of 1) giving notice to the tenant (and any other person	56.79999923706055	230.296630859375	12.0	481.11626052856445	15
residing there as well) to take prompt action to either correct the problem or otherwise leave the	56.79999923706055	244.09661865234375	12.0	480.86430740356445	15
premises (or, in some cases, unconditionally leave the premises), 2) if the tenant fails to leave the	56.79999923706055	257.8966064453125	12.0	481.0563850402832	15
premises, filing a lawsuit to evict the tenant and regain possession of the property (along with	56.79999923706055	271.6966552734375	12.0	480.9962043762207	15
amounts owed for damages, unpaid rent, and/or court costs and attorney's fees) and appearing in	56.79999923706055	285.49664306640625	12.0	481.1522102355957	15
court, and 3) if the tenant still remains in the premises, forcibly removing the tenant from them via	56.79999923706055	299.296630859375	12.0	480.7801399230957	15
legal action. Most jurisdictions do not permit the landlord to evict a tenant without first taking legal	56.79999923706055	313.09661865234375	12.0	481.15629959106445	15
action to do so (commonly referred to as a "self-help" eviction; such actions include changing locks,	56.79999923706055	326.89666748046875	12.0	481.45232009887695	15
removing items from the premises, or terminating utility services). Such evictions are generally	56.79999923706055	340.6966552734375	12.0	481.46428298950195	15
illegal at any time during the process (including after a landlord wins an eviction suit); a tenant	56.79999923706055	354.4966735839844	12.0	480.9962043762207	15
facing such measures may sue the landlord. However, self-help evictions may be permitted in some	56.79999923706055	368.2966613769531	12.0	481.0082893371582	15
jurisdictions when commercial tenants are involved, as opposed to residential tenants.	56.79999923706055	382.0966491699219	12.0	411.7682991027832	15
Prior to filing a suit in court for eviction, generally the landlord must provide written notice	92.30000305175781	401.89666748046875	12.0	445.4761199951172	16
to the tenant (commonly called a notice to quit or notice to vacate). A landlord may evict a tenant	56.79999923706055	415.660888671875	12.0357666015625	481.35600662231445	16
"without cause" (i.e., the landlord simply desires to end the landlord-tenant relationship without the	56.79999923706055	429.4966735839844	12.0	481.1762580871582	16
tenant being in breach of the lease, such as when a lease is about to expire) or "for cause" (i.e., the	56.79999923706055	443.2966613769531	12.0	481.4640998840332	16
tenant is in breach of the lease, such as non-payment of rent or allowing criminal activity to take	56.79999923706055	457.0966491699219	12.0	480.7442512512207	16
place on the premises). The notice to vacate may either be conditional (i.e., the tenant may remain	56.79999923706055	470.89666748046875	12.0	480.86430740356445	16
in the premises if certain actions are taken prior to the specified date, such as payment of rent and	56.79999923706055	484.6966552734375	12.0	480.99626541137695	16
late fees due; this is sometimes known as cure or quit) or unconditional (i.e., the tenant can not do	56.79999923706055	498.4966735839844	12.0	480.68437576293945	16
anything to avoid the eviction and must leave by a specified date, an example would be due to a	56.79999923706055	512.296630859375	12.0	481.3204231262207	16
tenant engaged in criminal activity). If the termination is without cause, the tenant is generally	56.79999923706055	526.0966796875	12.0	481.58427810668945	16
given a longer period of time (generally 30 days) to vacate than if the termination is for cause, in	56.79999923706055	539.8966674804688	12.0	480.9003791809082	16
which case the tenant may have a short amount of time (perhaps as few as three days) in which to	56.79999923706055	553.6966552734375	12.0	480.81608963012695	16
correct the violation. In some jurisdictions, landlords may not be able to terminate a lease without	56.79999923706055	567.4967041015625	12.0	481.10429763793945	16
cause (such as in rent control jurisdictions). Where the law permits, a landlord and tenant may agree	56.79999923706055	581.296630859375	11.999984741210938	481.4163703918457	16
to a different period of time for notice requirements than specified in the law.	56.79999923706055	595.0966796875	12.0	370.06828689575195	16
The issue of land-grabbing is another important category of evictions and displacements	92.30000305175781	614.8966674804688	12.0	445.65635681152344	17
worldwide. The issue of agricultural development is a significant driving factor, within the larger	56.79999923706055	628.6966552734375	12.0	481.1242561340332	17
umbrella of development, in target governments' agreement to investment by outsiders. The	56.79999923706055	642.4966430664062	12.0	481.32036209106445	17
Ethiopian government's acceptance of cash crop-based land acquisitions reflects its belief that	56.79999923706055	656.296630859375	12.0	481.28422927856445	17
switching to cash crop production would be even more beneficial for food security than having	56.79999923706055	670.0966796875	12.0	481.28422927856445	17
local farmers produce crops by themselves. Implicit in the characterization of African agriculture as	56.79999923706055	683.8966674804688	12.0	481.2604866027832	17
"underdeveloped" is the rejection of local communities' traditional methods of harvesting as an	56.79999923706055	697.6966552734375	12.0	481.2363166809082	17
inadequate form of food production. Foreign investors, through large-scale agriculture, increase the	56.79999923706055	711.4966430664062	12.0	481.62028884887695	17
effectiveness of underused resources of land, labor, and water, while further providing additional	56.79999923706055	725.296630859375	12.0	481.39213943481445	17

technology. Proposed increases in production quantity, as touted by investors and hosts, are	56.79999923706055	752.8966674804688	12.0	481.4280891418457	17
exemplified by Ethiopia’s Abera Deressa, who claims that “foreign investors should help boost	56.79999923706055	766.6966552734375	12.000003814697266	481.5362434387207	17
agricultural output by as much as 40%” throughout Ethiopia. In a joint research project between the	56.79999923706055	58.6966552734375	12.0	480.9962043762207	18
FAO, IIED, and IFAD, Cotula et al. found that the majority of host countries lacked basic data on	56.79999923706055	72.49664306640625	12.0	481.06828689575195	18
the size, nature, and location of land acquisitions through land registries or other public sources, and	56.79999923706055	86.296630859375	12.0	481.64433670043945	18
that “researchers needed to make multiple contacts…to access even superficial and incomplete	56.79999923706055	100.09661865234375	12.0	481.35625076293945	18
information.”. The World Bank’s own lack of land size information on over half of the reported land	56.79999923706055	113.8966064453125	12.0	481.6323127746582	18
grabs that it researched points to the difficulties inherent in gaining access to and researching	56.79999923706055	127.6966552734375	12.0	481.45232009887695	18
individual land acquisitions. We can also mention some notable cases of land grabbing as a specific	56.79999923706055	141.49664306640625	12.0	481.42815017700195	18
category of internal displacement. In Madagascar, the anger among the population about land sales	56.79999923706055	155.296630859375	12.0	481.1042366027832	18
led to violent protests. The South Korean corporation Daewoo was in the process of negotiations	56.79999923706055	169.09661865234375	12.0	481.02019119262695	18
with the Malagasy government for the purchase of 1.3 million hectares, half of all agricultural land,	56.79999923706055	182.8966064453125	12.0	481.1282844543457	18
to produce corn and palm oil. This investment, while one of many pursued in Madagascar, attracted	56.79999923706055	196.6966552734375	12.0	481.0921516418457	18
considerable attention there and led to protests against the government. In South Sudan, numerous	56.79999923706055	210.49664306640625	12.0	481.36821365356445	18
large-scale land acquisitions have taken place in spite of the country's unresolved political and	56.79999923706055	224.296630859375	12.0	480.94816970825195	18

development. According to Bogumil Terminski (2012) approximately fifteen million people each	56.79999923706055	340.6966552734375	12.0	481.4640998840332	19
year are forced to leave their homes following big development projects (dams, irrigation projects,	56.79999923706055	354.4966735839844	12.0	481.39213943481445	19
highways, urbanization, mining, conservation of nature, etc.). Anthony Oliver-Smith (2009) and	56.79999923706055	368.2966613769531	12.0	481.1762580871582	19
Michael M. Cernea (2006) are also estimating that current scale of DIDR amounts to 15 million	56.79999923706055	382.0966491699219	12.0	481.06816482543945	19

Jimenez founded the human rights Latino organization: Young Lords, Mayor Richard J. Daley	56.79999923706055	423.4966735839844	12.0	481.0679817199707	19
displaced tens of thousands Puerto Ricans and the poor. This displacement helped to proliferate	56.79999923706055	437.2966613769531	12.0	481.29619216918945	19
growing street gangs. Today these gangs enterprises with murder for hire, arson for profit and drug	56.79999923706055	451.0966491699219	12.0	480.9841194152832	19

Cernea the main causes of development-induced displacement include: water supply (construction	56.79999923706055	533.8966674804688	12.0	481.4522590637207	19

expansion of agriculture, parks and forest reserves and population redistribution schemes.	56.79999923706055	575.296630859375	11.999984741210938	481.21220779418945	19
According to Bogumil Terminski the principal causes of DIDR include: 1. the construction of dams,	56.79999923706055	589.0966796875	12.0	481.0803108215332	19
hydroplants, and large irrigation projects, 2. the building of highways, roads and railroad networks,	56.79999923706055	602.8966674804688	12.0	481.0920295715332	19
3. urbanization and social services (expansion of cities, urban transport, water supply), 4. expansion	56.79999923706055	616.6966552734375	12.0	481.3083381652832	19
of agriculture (especially monoculture plantations), 5. mining (oil exploitation, gold, copper, coal	56.79999923706055	630.4966430664062	12.0	481.09221267700195	19

Kampala Convention (formally, the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of	56.79999923706055	58.6966552734375	12.0	481.1280403137207	22
Internally Displaced Persons in Africa) is a treaty of the AU that addresses internal displacement	56.79999923706055	72.49664306640625	12.0	481.4763069152832	22

2009. As of 2015 it has been signed by 40 and ratified by 24 of the 54 member states of the African	56.79999923706055	100.09661865234375	12.0	481.27226638793945	22
Union. The Convention entered into force on 6 December 2012, 30 days after its ratification by the	56.79999923706055	113.8966064453125	12.0	480.98405838012695	22
15th state. Article 5(4) specifically establishes state responsibilities for the protection and assistance	56.79999923706055	127.6966552734375	12.0	481.4163703918457	22
of internally displaced persons, whose displacement is the result of "natural or human made	56.79999923706055	141.49664306640625	12.0	481.22429275512695	22
disasters, including cvlimate change. Centre of Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE) is	56.79999923706055	155.296630859375	12.0	481.23613357543945	22
important NGO actor in the field of evictions worldwide. COHRE’s work was based on the	56.79999923706055	169.09661865234375	12.0	481.15214920043945	22
assumption that the role of the affected communities is of crucial importance in addressing housing	56.79999923706055	182.8966064453125	12.0	481.59611892700195	22
rights violations. The poor themselves should be directly involved in formulating and implementing	56.79999923706055	196.6966552734375	12.0	481.2244758605957	22
solutions and alternatives. Communities have a vital contribution to make, without which most	56.79999923706055	210.49664306640625	12.0	481.2844123840332	22
housing-related projects simply will not succeed. In housing rights or eviction cases where COHRE	56.79999923706055	224.296630859375	12.0	481.38029861450195	22
became directly involved, COHRE therefore strived to build alliances and partnerships and to	56.79999923706055	238.09661865234375	12.0	481.5003547668457	22
embark on joint campaigns with groups and support organisations working at community level.	56.79999923706055	251.8966064453125	12.0	480.9361457824707	22
Working at community level is often not sufficient in itself. As national, regional and international	56.79999923706055	265.6966552734375	12.0	481.2723274230957	22
action can be very effective in cases of major housing rights violations, COHRE also formed	56.79999923706055	279.49664306640625	12.0	481.2120246887207	22
partnerships with organisations working at these broader levels. Another tool is the collection of	56.79999923706055	293.296630859375	12.0	481.46428298950195	22
relevant, accurate information. COHRE regularly sends multi-disciplinary fact-finding teams to key	56.79999923706055	307.09661865234375	12.0	481.4284553527832	22
focus countries. They typically conduct in-loco investigations, conduct interviews with the main	56.79999923706055	320.89666748046875	12.0	481.3803596496582	22
role players, study relevant laws, policies and programmes and do any additional research required	56.79999923706055	334.6966552734375	12.0	481.4522590637207	22
for an assessment of the nature and scope of land and housing rights violations in a particular	56.79999923706055	348.4966735839844	12.0	481.2361946105957	22
situation. This would provide the basis for drawing up recommendations and alternatives. These	56.79999923706055	362.2966613769531	12.0	481.42815017700195	22
missions are usually conducted at the request of, and in collaboration with, local partners. COHRE	56.79999923706055	376.0966491699219	12.0	481.44023513793945	22
used the draft fact-finding reports as tools for consultation and negotiations with key role-players,	56.79999923706055	389.89666748046875	12.0	481.1523323059082	22
including governments. This strategy has proven effective in convincing government to grapple	56.79999923706055	403.6966552734375	12.0	481.52434158325195	22
with the extent of the violations and the implications of proceeding with current policies and	56.79999923706055	417.4966735839844	12.0	481.2363166809082	22
practice. Once finalised, COHRE fact-finding reports are used as information resources for local	56.79999923706055	431.2966613769531	12.0	481.3920783996582	22
human rights organisations and the affected communities; for lobbying the relevant government to	56.79999923706055	445.0966491699219	12.0	481.27214431762695	22
introduce new policies, laws and programmes. Fact-finding reports are also useful tools at regional	56.79999923706055	458.89666748046875	12.0	480.9001350402832	22
and international level to place pressure on the relevant governments; and to form the basis of	56.79999923706055	472.6966552734375	12.0	481.22429275512695	22
shadow reports for submission before UN human rights mechanisms and other regional and	56.79999923706055	486.4966735839844	12.0	481.5961799621582	22
international bodies. COHRE promotes policy and legislative reform at national, regional and	56.79999923706055	500.2608642578125	12.0357666015625	481.53630447387695	22
international level, to ensure that housing rights and delivery frameworks and legal instruments are	56.79999923706055	514.0966796875	12.0	481.35612869262695	22
