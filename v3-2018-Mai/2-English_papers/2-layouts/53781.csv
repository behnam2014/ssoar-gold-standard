Bureaucracy is the management apparatus of a state administration. Even in private sector,	100.01998901367188	309.004150390625	11.0400390625	422.8100280761719	7
bureaucratic organization is very much essential for its smooth functioning and betterment. A	71.70399475097656	321.72412109375	11.040008544921875	451.52024841308594	7
legalized domination of bureaucracy only can ensure highest efficiency of an organization in a	71.70399475097656	334.3241271972656	11.040008544921875	451.05027770996094	7
country. But the state bureaucracy of Bangladesh not developed legally from Pre-colonial period to	71.70399475097656	347.04412841796875	11.040008544921875	451.4608612060547	7
post-colonial phase as well as an independent Bangladesh eventually. The state bureaucracy of	71.70399475097656	359.6441345214844	11.040008544921875	451.25108337402344	7
Bangladesh is patrimonial in nature based on personal interests. The politicians and bureaucrats are	71.70399475097656	372.244140625	11.040008544921875	451.3568572998047	7
interdependent in various manners for the fulfillment of their purpose illegally in Democratic	71.70399475097656	384.9641418457031	11.040008544921875	451.4961395263672	7
Bangladesh. Simultaneously, the impact of militarism still exists in state bureaucracy of Bangladesh	71.70399475097656	397.5841369628906	11.040008544921875	451.25047302246094	7
as it faced military rule in several times.	71.70399475097656	410.30413818359375	11.040008544921875	176.66598510742188	7

1. INTRODUCTION	71.70399475097656	492.0914611816406	12.0	110.97599792480469	9
The extension of society is state. Sometimes Plato treats state as society. According to	100.01998901367188	521.3714599609375	12.0	422.8760070800781	10
Plato, state grows out of the nature of individual. Plato said, ‘‘the state is a natural institution,	71.70399475097656	535.1714477539062	12.0	451.08006286621094	10
natural because it reflects the structure of human nature. The origin of the state is a reflection	71.70399475097656	549.00146484375	12.0	451.3719940185547	10
of man’s economic needs, for, says Plato, `a state comes into existence because no individual	71.70399475097656	562.8014526367188	12.0	451.0919647216797	10
is self-sufficing; we all have many needs.” (Stumpf: 1975). On the basis of knowledge and	71.70399475097656	576.6014404296875	11.999984741210938	451.28196716308594	10
nature of a society, Plato designed the ideal type of state considering three distinctive classes;	71.70399475097656	590.4014892578125	12.0	451.12608337402344	10
King Philosopher, Warrior and Producer. Unlike Plato, Aristotle did not create a blueprint	71.70399475097656	604.2014770507812	12.0	451.1859588623047	10
for an ideal state. But in his Politics, Aristotle says that, “it is evident that the State is a	71.70399475097656	618.00146484375	12.0	451.33396911621094	10
creature of nature, and that man is by nature a political animal.” (Stumpf: 1975). Aristotle	71.70399475097656	631.8014526367188	12.0	451.28599548339844	10
viewed the state as the agency for enabling men to achieve their ultimate goals as human	71.70399475097656	645.6014404296875	12.0	450.96006774902344	10
being. Aristotle also sketched the different types of state nature; like Monarchy (one ruler),	71.70399475097656	659.4014892578125	12.0	451.37193298339844	10
Aristocracy (few rulers) and Polity (many). He observed three idiosyncratic classes in state;	71.70399475097656	673.2014770507812	12.0	451.31797790527344	10
Extreme Rich, Middle class and Extreme poor. His preference was middle class for governing	71.70399475097656	687.00146484375	12.0	451.36595153808594	10
state to the holistic welfare.	71.70399475097656	700.8014526367188	12.0	132.1920166015625	10
As an Enlightenment philosopher, Hobbs, Locke and Rousseau tried to observe state as	100.01998901367188	714.6214599609375	12.0	422.8340148925781	10
a new dimension. According to Hobbs state was uneven for the people in primary stage. He	71.70399475097656	728.4214477539062	12.0	451.02000427246094	10
argued that social contract to be needed for declining the inequality. According to Locke, the	71.70399475097656	742.221435546875	12.0	451.00804138183594	10

uneven nature of state was the golden age of human society which becomes conflicting later.	71.70399475097656	99.04150390625	12.0	451.0459442138672	14
For the resolution of such conflict, absence of common authority is essential, Locke argued.	71.70399475097656	112.84149169921875	12.0	451.0920867919922	14
For Rousseau, man is free by birth, but step by step they become chained by social	71.70399475097656	126.6414794921875	12.0	450.88804626464844	14
surrounding. In that situation, Rousseau expects the state interference to the freedom of	71.70399475097656	140.44146728515625	12.0	451.0339813232422	14
people. From the Marxist point of view, the state is a special organ that appears at a certain	71.70399475097656	154.24151611328125	12.0	450.87596130371094	14
moment in the historical evolution of mankind. It is born from the division of society into	71.70399475097656	168.04150390625	12.0	451.0680389404297	14
classes and act as an instrument in the hands of the possessing class for the purpose of	71.70399475097656	181.84149169921875	12.0	451.00791931152344	14
maintaining the domination of this class over society. (Mandel: 2003).	71.70399475097656	195.6414794921875	12.0	337.37998962402344	14
This domination causes class conflict in a society. According to Karl Marx, state is the	100.01998901367188	209.44146728515625	12.0	422.7720031738281	14
means of economic conflict but noting. Levine stated that the rise of state involved the	71.70399475097656	223.24151611328125	12.0	451.1239471435547	14
separation of the public and private spheres and the development of specialized political	71.70399475097656	237.04150390625	12.0	451.18809509277344	14
institutions. (Levine: 1924). Max Weber argued that sometimes political components control	71.70399475097656	250.87152099609375	12.0	451.4039764404297	14
over the economic elements in the state on the basis of authority. He characterized three ideal	71.70399475097656	264.6715087890625	12.0	451.39195251464844	14
types of legitimate authority by state nature; Rational Legitimacy, Traditional Legitimacy and	71.70399475097656	278.47149658203125	12.0	451.53599548339844	14
Charismatic Legitimacy. (Abraham & Morgan: 1994). According to Weber, modern state	71.70399475097656	292.271484375	12.0	451.2400360107422	14
based on legal authority which led to formation of governing body called bureaucracy.	71.70399475097656	306.07147216796875	12.0	450.9239959716797	14
Without bureaucracy state never run purposively, Weber argued. Our objective of the study is	71.70399475097656	319.87152099609375	11.999969482421875	450.99607849121094	14
to elucidate state nature according to bureaucratic characteristics on the basis of theoretical	71.70399475097656	333.67144775390625	12.0	451.07798767089844	14
understanding in post colonial period of Bangladesh. Weber’s explanation of bureaucracy and	71.70399475097656	347.4714660644531	12.0	451.25999450683594	14
its later discussion underpins the study for gaining our objectives.	71.70399475097656	361.2714538574219	12.0	315.3159942626953	14

Historical context of Bureaucracy: Bureaucratic Theory was developed by a German	100.01998901367188	442.2914733886719	12.0	422.8639831542969	17
Sociologist and political economist Max Weber. According to him, bureaucracy is the most	71.70399475097656	456.0914611816406	12.0	451.2400360107422	17
efficient form of organization which has a well-defined line of authority. It has clear rules and	71.70399475097656	469.8914489746094	12.0	451.23997497558594	17
regulations which are strictly followed. Weber believed that a bureaucratic type of	71.70399475097656	483.69146728515625	12.0	451.2579803466797	17
organization began in societies whose political organization tended toward officialdom. As	71.70399475097656	497.491455078125	12.0	451.1040496826172	17
described by Ken Morrision, Early examples of societies with large political administrations	71.70399475097656	511.29150390625	12.0	451.3540496826172	17
include the Germanic and Mongolian empires, and feudal estates of the twelfth and thirteenth	71.70399475097656	525.0914306640625	12.0	451.06797790527344	17
century. Among these societies, Weber cited the cases of emperors and feudal lords who,	71.70399475097656	538.8914794921875	12.0	450.9479217529297	17
when making known their decrees and pronouncements, would appoint commissioners whose	71.70399475097656	552.721435546875	12.0	451.34202575683594	17
power were exercised within the lord’s jurisdiction. Weber identified six basic types of	71.70399475097656	566.521484375	12.0	450.9479217529297	17
Bureaucratic structure: (Morrision: 1998) –	71.70399475097656	580.3214721679688	11.999984741210938	208.00599670410156	17

Weber looked at the administration of early Egypt and Rome, at the administration of	100.01998901367188	712.5814819335938	11.999992370605469	423.0499572753906	19
Catholic Church, at Asiatic societies and at feudal economies of central Europe. While these	71.70399475097656	726.3814697265625	12.0	451.06809997558594	19
societies develop administrative staff and trained decision maker, they are in weber’s view,	71.70399475097656	740.1814575195312	12.0	450.87608337402344	19

formally pre-bureaucratic in their administration which restricts the development of	71.70399475097656	99.04150390625	12.0	451.23789978027344	22
bureaucracy to modern society. According to Hellen Constas, Weber defined such kinds of	71.70399475097656	112.84149169921875	12.0	451.11595153808594	22
bureaucracy is patrimonial bureaucracy depends on charismatic or traditional authority	71.70399475097656	126.6414794921875	12.0	451.1999969482422	22

Mainly Max Weber talked about the bureaucracy based on legal or rational legitimacy	100.01998901367188	154.24151611328125	12.0	422.7959899902344	22
in modern industrial society. According to Weber, ‘Bureaucracy refers to an instrument that	71.70399475097656	168.04150390625	12.0	451.0199432373047	22
has become indispensible for the rational attainment of the goals of any organization in	71.70399475097656	181.84149169921875	12.0	451.3920135498047	22
industrial society’. (Rao: 2000). According to Weber, the term bureaucracy in terms of an	71.70399475097656	195.6414794921875	12.0	451.0659637451172	22
organization and management functions refers to the following six principles (Miller: 2008):	71.70399475097656	209.44146728515625	12.0	444.1479949951172	22
Management by rules: A bureaucracy follows a consistent set of rules that control the	71.70399475097656	229.24151611328125	12.0	451.3960418701172	23
functions of the organization. Management controls the lower levels of the organization's	71.70399475097656	243.07147216796875	12.0	451.1040496826172	23
hierarchy by applying established rules in a consistent and predictable manner.	71.70399475097656	256.87152099609375	12.0	378.2539825439453	23
Division of labor: Authority and responsibility are clearly defined and officially sanctioned.	71.70399475097656	276.6715087890625	12.0	451.2159881591797	24
Job descriptions are specified with responsibilities and line of authority. All employees have	71.70399475097656	290.47149658203125	12.0	451.0321502685547	24
thus clearly defined rules in a system of authority and subordination.	71.70399475097656	304.271484375	12.0	329.4240264892578	24
Formal hierarchical structure: An organization is organized into a hierarchy of authority	71.70399475097656	324.07147216796875	12.0	451.43199157714844	25
and follows a clear chain of command. The hierarchical structure effectively delineates the	71.70399475097656	337.8714599609375	12.0	451.06809997558594	25
lines of authority and the subordination of the lower levels to the upper levels of the	71.70399475097656	351.67144775390625	12.0	451.09202575683594	25
hierarchical structure.	71.70399475097656	365.4714660644531	12.0	104.48402404785156	25
Personnel hired on grounds of technical competence: Appointment to a position within the	71.70399475097656	385.2714538574219	12.0	451.4260711669922	26
organization is made on the grounds of technical competence. Work is assigned based on the	71.70399475097656	399.0914611816406	12.0	451.0439910888672	26
experience and competence of the individual.	71.70399475097656	412.8914489746094	12.0	217.75205993652344	26
Managers are salaried officials: A manager is a salaried official and does own the	71.70399475097656	432.69146728515625	12.0	398.33799743652344	27
administered unit. All elements of a bureaucracy are defined with clearly defined roles and	71.70399475097656	446.491455078125	12.0	435.6000213623047	27
responsibilities and are managed by trained and experienced specialists.	71.70399475097656	460.2914733886719	12.0	344.73597717285156	27
Written documents: All decisions, rules and actions taken by the organization are formulated	71.70399475097656	480.0914611816406	12.0	451.2159881591797	28
and recorded in writing. Written documents ensure that there is continuity of the	71.70399475097656	493.8914489746094	12.0	451.02000427246094	28
organization’s policies and procedures.	71.70399475097656	507.69146728515625	12.0	187.8600311279297	28
Max Weber was the first to give an elaborate account of the development of	100.01998901367188	527.491455078125	12.0	422.7480163574219	29
bureaucracy as well as its causes and consequences. According to Weber, modern	71.70399475097656	541.29150390625	12.0	451.1179656982422	29
officialdom functions in the specific manner. He attributed the following characteristics to	71.70399475097656	555.1214599609375	12.0	451.09202575683594	29
bureaucracy in his book ‘Economy and Society’ (Weber: 1968) –	71.70399475097656	568.9214477539062	12.0	313.51600646972656	29
I. There is the principle of fixed and official jurisdictional areas, which are generally ordered	71.70399475097656	588.721435546875	12.0	451.10191345214844	30
by rules, that is, by laws or administrative regulations.	71.70399475097656	602.521484375	12.0	260.14796447753906	30
1. The regular activities required for the purposes of the bureaucratically governed	107.69998931884766	616.3214721679688	12.0	414.94795989990234	30
structure are distributed in a fixed way as official duties.	107.69998931884766	630.1214599609375	12.0	270.6000289916992	30
2. The authority to give the commands required for the discharge of these duties is	107.69998931884766	643.9214477539062	12.0	415.1521224975586	30
distributed in a stable way and is strictly delimited by rules concerning the coercive	107.69998931884766	657.721435546875	12.0	415.01998138427734	30
means, physical, sacerdotal, or otherwise, which may be placed at the disposal of	107.69998931884766	671.521484375	12.0	415.10408782958984	30
officials.	107.69998931884766	685.3214721679688	12.0	42.204002380371094	30
3. Methodical provision is made for the regular and continuous fulfillment of these	107.69998931884766	699.1214599609375	12.0	415.0200424194336	30
duties and for the execution of the corresponding rights; only persons who have the	107.69998931884766	712.9414672851562	11.999992370605469	415.0919418334961	30
generally regulated qualifications to serve are employed.	107.69998931884766	726.741455078125	12.0	271.8960189819336	30

Volume 7	290.25	24.25543212890625	12.0	53.2919921875	32
In public and lawful government these three elements constitute 'bureaucratic authority.' In	71.70399475097656	99.04150390625	12.0	451.04600524902344	33
private economic domination, they constitute bureaucratic 'management.' Bureaucracy, thus	71.70399475097656	112.84149169921875	12.0	450.9719696044922	33
understood, is fully developed in political and ecclesiastical communities only in the modern	71.70399475097656	126.6414794921875	12.0	450.9359588623047	33
state, and, in the private economy, only in the most advanced institutions of capitalism.	71.70399475097656	140.44146728515625	12.0	450.98399353027344	33
Permanent and public office authority, with fixed jurisdiction, is not the historical rule but	71.70399475097656	154.24151611328125	12.0	450.9120330810547	33
rather the exception. This is so even in large political structures such as those of the ancient	71.70399475097656	168.04150390625	12.0	451.4679412841797	33
Orient, the Germanic and Mongolian empires of conquest, or of many feudal structures of	71.70399475097656	181.84149169921875	12.0	451.0079803466797	33
state. In all these cases, the ruler executes the most important measures through personal	71.70399475097656	195.6414794921875	12.0	450.93601989746094	33
trustees, table-companions, or court-servants. Their commissions and authority are not	71.70399475097656	209.44146728515625	12.0	451.22203063964844	33
precisely delimited and are temporarily called into being for each case.	71.70399475097656	223.24151611328125	12.0	339.92396545410156	33
II. The principles of office hierarchy and of levels of graded authority mean a firmly ordered	71.70399475097656	243.07147216796875	12.0	451.0199432373047	34
system of super- and subordination in which there is a supervision of the lower offices by the	71.70399475097656	256.87152099609375	12.0	451.2820281982422	34
higher ones. Such a system offers the governed the possibility of appealing the decision of a	71.70399475097656	270.6715087890625	12.0	450.8881072998047	34
lower office to its higher authority, in a definitely regulated manner. With the full	71.70399475097656	284.47149658203125	12.0	450.96006774902344	34
development of the bureaucratic type, the office hierarchy is monocratically organized. The	71.70399475097656	298.271484375	12.0	451.21397399902344	34
principle of hierarchical office authority is found in all bureaucratic structures: in state and	71.70399475097656	312.07147216796875	12.0	451.2120819091797	34
ecclesiastical structures as well as in large party organizations and 'private' or private	71.70399475097656	325.8714599609375	12.0	451.0320281982422	34
enterprises. It does not matter for the character of bureaucracy whether its authority is called	71.70399475097656	339.67144775390625	12.0	451.21604919433594	34
'public.'	71.70399475097656	353.4714660644531	12.0	37.2960205078125	34
When the principle of jurisdictional 'competency' is fully carried through, hierarchical	71.70399475097656	367.2714538574219	12.0	451.02000427246094	34
subordination--at least in public office--does not mean that the 'higher' authority is simply	71.70399475097656	381.07147216796875	12.0	451.4320526123047	34
authorized to take over the business of the 'lower.' Indeed, the opposite is the rule. Once	71.70399475097656	394.8914489746094	12.0	451.2479705810547	34
established and having fulfilled its task, an office tends to continue in existence and be held	71.70399475097656	408.69146728515625	12.0	451.16404724121094	34
by another incumbent.	71.70399475097656	422.491455078125	12.0	107.49601745605469	34
III. The management of the modern office is based upon written documents ('the files'),	71.70399475097656	442.2914733886719	12.0	451.0339813232422	35
which are preserved in their original or draught form. There is, therefore, a staff of subaltern	71.70399475097656	456.0914611816406	12.0	451.09202575683594	35
officials and scribes of all sorts. The body of officials actively engaged in a 'public' office,	71.70399475097656	469.8914489746094	12.0	451.28404235839844	35
along with the respective apparatus of material implements and the files make up a 'bureau.'	71.70399475097656	483.69146728515625	12.0	451.0079803466797	35
In private enterprise, 'the bureau' is often called 'the office.'	71.70399475097656	497.491455078125	12.0	283.42808532714844	35
In principle, the modern organization of the civil service separates the bureau from the	71.70399475097656	511.29150390625	12.0	450.94798278808594	35
private domicile of the official, and, in general, bureaucracy segregates official activity as	71.70399475097656	525.0914306640625	12.0	451.11802673339844	35
something distinct from the sphere of private life. Public monies and equipment are divorced	71.70399475097656	538.8914794921875	12.0	451.07994079589844	35
from the private property of the official. This condition is everywhere the product of a long	71.70399475097656	552.721435546875	12.0	451.3719940185547	35
development. Nowadays, it is found in public as well as in private enterprises; in the latter,	71.70399475097656	566.521484375	12.0	451.18797302246094	35
the principle extends even to the leading entrepreneur. In principle, the executive office is	71.70399475097656	580.3214721679688	11.999984741210938	451.0079803466797	35
separated from the household, business from private correspondence, and business assets	71.70399475097656	594.1214599609375	12.0	451.12596130371094	35
from private fortunes. The more consistently the modern type of business management has	71.70399475097656	607.9214477539062	12.0	451.05613708496094	35
been carried through the more are these separations the case. The beginnings of this process	71.70399475097656	621.721435546875	12.0	450.9360809326172	35
are to be found as early as the middle Ages.	71.70399475097656	635.521484375	12.0	209.76197814941406	35
IV. Office management, at least all specialized office management-- and such management is	71.70399475097656	655.3214721679688	12.0	451.32408142089844	36
distinctly modern--usually presupposes thorough and expert training. This increasingly holds	71.70399475097656	669.1214599609375	12.0	451.0940399169922	36
for the modern executive and employee of private enterprises, in the same manner as it holds	71.70399475097656	682.9214477539062	12.0	451.22203063964844	36
for the state official.	71.70399475097656	696.721435546875	12.0	97.18801879882812	36
V. When the office is fully developed, official activity demands the full working capacity of	71.70399475097656	710.5414428710938	12.0	450.9359588623047	36
the official, irrespective of the fact that his obligatory time in the bureau may be firmly	71.70399475097656	724.3414306640625	12.0	451.2480926513672	36
delimited. In the normal case, this is only the product of a long development, in the public as	71.70399475097656	738.1414794921875	12.0	451.0040740966797	36
International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 7	102.25	24.25543212890625	12.0	351.7080993652344	37
47	524.6599731445312	24.25543212890625	12.0	13.343994140625	38
well as in the private office. Formerly, in all cases, the normal state of affairs was reversed:	71.70399475097656	99.04150390625	12.0	450.8879852294922	39
official business was discharged as a secondary activity.	71.70399475097656	112.84149169921875	12.0	269.6279754638672	39
VI. The management of the office follows general rules, which are more or less stable, more	71.70399475097656	132.6414794921875	12.0	451.11204528808594	40
or less exhaustive, and which can be learned. Knowledge of these rules represents a special	71.70399475097656	146.44146728515625	12.0	451.0559539794922	40
technical learning which the officials possess. It involves jurisprudence, or administrative or	71.70399475097656	160.24151611328125	12.0	451.39598083496094	40
business management.	71.70399475097656	174.04150390625	12.0	107.84400939941406	40
The reduction of modern office management to rules is deeply embedded in its very nature.	71.70399475097656	187.84149169921875	12.0	450.97215270996094	40
The theory of modern public administration, for instance, assumes that the authority to order	71.70399475097656	201.6414794921875	12.0	451.09202575683594	40
certain matters by decree--which has been legally granted to public authorities--does not	71.70399475097656	215.44146728515625	12.0	451.4800262451172	40
entitle the bureau to regulate the matter by commands given for each case, but only to	71.70399475097656	229.24151611328125	12.0	450.8520965576172	40
regulate the matter abstractly. This stands in extreme contrast to the regulation of all	71.70399475097656	243.07147216796875	12.0	451.0320281982422	40
relationships through individual privileges and bestowals of favor, which is absolutely	71.70399475097656	256.87152099609375	12.0	451.42991638183594	40
dominant in patrimonialism, at least in so far as such relationships are not fixed by sacred	71.70399475097656	270.6715087890625	12.0	450.93601989746094	40
tradition.	71.70399475097656	284.47149658203125	12.0	43.644004821777344	40
State Bureaucracy in Bangladesh perspective	71.70399475097656	312.31146240234375	12.0	231.42198181152344	41
Hamza Alavi (1921-2003): There are very few theoretical contribution instituted on	100.01998901367188	331.8714599609375	12.0	422.9540100097656	42
the study of post-colonial state like Bangladesh. Alavi’s one of the most important works	71.70399475097656	345.67144775390625	12.0	451.12998962402344	42
entitled `The State in post-colonial societies: Pakistan and Bangladesh’ based on	71.70399475097656	359.4714660644531	12.0	451.0819549560547	42
interpretation of autonomous state in the third world. According to Anupam Sen, `His main	71.70399475097656	373.2714538574219	12.0	451.25804138183594	42
argument is as follows: in the colonial period the bureaucratic military state apparatus was	71.70399475097656	387.07147216796875	12.0	450.8879852294922	42

post-colonial period too, Alavi Argues, the state has remain autonomous, because no single	71.70399475097656	414.69146728515625	12.0	451.20188903808594	42
class has succeeded in establishing its rule over the over-developed state.’ (Sen: 2009). In his	71.70399475097656	428.491455078125	12.0	451.10203552246094	42
theoretical explanation, Alavi tried build up relationship between bureaucracy and other	71.70399475097656	442.2914733886719	12.0	451.1160125732422	42
social classes. He also revealed that bureaucracy act as an interwoven among the interest of	71.70399475097656	456.0914611816406	12.0	450.8839569091797	42
three social classes; Metropolitan Bourgeoisie, Indigenous Bourgeoisie and Upper class	71.70399475097656	469.8914489746094	12.0	451.1300506591797	42
based on land. (Alam: 2007). The main arguments of his theory are as follows –	71.70399475097656	483.69146728515625	12.0	385.27598571777344	42
1. State bureaucracy is overdeveloped in post-colonial societies	89.58399200439453	503.491455078125	12.0	310.37801361083984	43
2. Indigenous bourgeoisie are underdeveloped	89.70399475097656	517.29150390625	12.0	227.34800720214844	43
3. State bureaucracy is autonomous.	89.70399475097656	531.0914306640625	12.0	179.20399475097656	43
He also pointed out that the post-colonial state is surrounded and driven by powerful	100.01998901367188	550.9214477539062	12.0	422.7900695800781	44
bureaucratic military. This point is very much applicable to understand post-colonial state	71.70399475097656	564.721435546875	12.0	451.2880096435547	44

Anupam Sen: He introduced bureaucratic interpretation in his PhD dissertation from	100.01998901367188	598.3214721679688	12.0	422.8019714355469	45
new-Marxist point of view. Dr. Sen tried to find out the limitation of Hamza Alavi’s	71.70399475097656	612.1214599609375	12.0	451.0441131591797	45
interpretation of Bureaucracy and state nature of post-colonial Bangladesh. According to Sen,	71.70399475097656	625.9214477539062	12.0	451.2579803466797	45
`It is true that, as he (Alavi) asserts, the classes in most third world countries are	71.70399475097656	639.721435546875	12.0	451.4080047607422	45
underdeveloped. But it is not true; as he claims that the state apparatus was over –	71.70399475097656	653.521484375	12.0	451.41600036621094	45
development in the colonial period. In fact, in many independent but semi-colonized	71.70399475097656	667.3214721679688	12.0	451.4919891357422	45
countries – such as most Latin American countries and Nepal, Thailand, Afghanistan and Iran	71.70399475097656	681.1214599609375	12.0	451.22801208496094	45
for example – the state apparatus, the bureaucracy, the judiciary, etc., remain	71.70399475097656	694.9214477539062	12.0	451.4559783935547	45
underdeveloped. (Sen: 2009).	71.70399475097656	708.741455078125	11.999992370605469	141.98599243164062	45
Dr. Sen stated that the social classes in most post-colonial third world societies have	100.01998901367188	736.3414306640625	12.0	423.0140686035156	46

developed by the colonial rulers, as Alavi argues, but because the state was stronger than the	71.70399475097656	99.04150390625	12.0	451.0699920654297	49
social classes long before these societies were colonized.	71.70399475097656	112.84149169921875	12.0	273.20603942871094	49
The state apparatus in most pre-colonial societies was patriarchal but superior vis-à-vis	100.01998901367188	126.6414794921875	12.0	423.0640563964844	49
the indigenous social classes. The colonial state apparatus, at least in the case of India 9 (as	71.70399475097656	140.44146728515625	12.0	451.40403747558594	49
well as Pakistan and Bangladesh), evolved from the patriarchal Moghul state which the	71.70399475097656	154.24151611328125	12.0	451.3820037841797	49
colonizing power inherited.’ (Sen: 2009). So, the main features of his theory regarding state	71.70399475097656	168.04150390625	12.0	451.1660614013672	49
of Bangladesh are as follows –	71.70399475097656	181.84149169921875	12.0	147.62599182128906	49
1. State bureaucracy is stronger than the social classes now and long before these	89.58399200439453	201.6414794921875	12.0	433.2560348510742	50
societies were colonized that means the state apparatus (Bureaucracy) was over-	107.33999633789062	215.44146728515625	12.0	415.5759582519531	50

2. The state apparatus in most pre-colonial societies was patriarchal and the colonial	89.70399475097656	243.07147216796875	12.0	433.35411071777344	50

3. Historically the state bureaucracy of Bangladesh still bears its pre-colonial and	89.70399475097656	270.6715087890625	12.0	433.35997009277344	50

Emajuddin Ahmed: Another scholar, Dr. Emajuddin Ahmed discussed on	100.01998901367188	304.271484375	12.0	422.9459533691406	51
Bureaucratic Elites in Bangladesh on his PhD dissertation. Mainly his dissertation based on	71.70399475097656	318.07147216796875	11.999969482421875	451.1999969482422	51
the study to analyze the nature of the dominant bureaucratic elites in Bangladesh and the	71.70399475097656	331.8714599609375	12.0	451.06797790527344	51
development strategy they have been pursuing.	71.70399475097656	345.67144775390625	12.0	225.7320098876953	51
He argues in his study that the ideal relationship between the general public and their	100.01998901367188	359.4714660644531	12.0	422.9159240722656	51
leaders, as these civil servants see it, does not differ very much from the colonial pattern.	71.70399475097656	373.2714538574219	12.0	451.1179656982422	51
(Ahmed: 1980). He also said the existing administrative structure and the institutional	71.70399475097656	387.07147216796875	12.0	451.1639862060547	51
framework were built long ago by the British in colonial India with a view to achieving their	71.70399475097656	400.8914489746094	12.0	451.06797790527344	51
limited ends, and these institutions served them well. (Ahmed: 1980). By following the	71.70399475097656	414.69146728515625	12.0	451.11192321777344	51
arguments of Dr. Emajuddin Ahmed, the nature of Bureaucracy in Bangladesh would be –	71.70399475097656	428.491455078125	12.0	433.53599548339844	51
1. The relationships among general public, their leaders and civil servants (Bureaucrats)	89.58399200439453	448.2914733886719	12.0	433.1239547729492	52
are colonial in nature.	107.33999633789062	462.0914611816406	12.0	104.48399353027344	52
2. The present Bureaucratic framework is similar as administration in colonial	89.70399475097656	475.8914489746094	12.0	433.0760955810547	52

A.T.M. Obaidullah: According to him, ‘Since Bangladesh does not have, as yet, a	100.01998901367188	509.491455078125	12.0	422.8100280761719	53

These various statutory and non-statutory rules provide detailed guidelines on	100.01998901367188	564.721435546875	12.0	423.0879821777344	53

the question of promotion, he argues that In respect of promotion and career opportunities	71.70399475097656	592.3214721679688	12.0	451.1160125732422	53
discrimination on political consideration happens to be so conspicuous that denies the	71.70399475097656	606.1214599609375	12.0	451.2519989013672	53

The civil service of Bangladesh as such is in real precarious conditions, amounts to a	100.01998901367188	702.741455078125	12.0	422.8679504394531	53

The British established their rule in Bengal by defeating Mughol Empire in 1757. As	100.01998901367188	243.07147216796875	12.0	422.8559265136719	59

fighting in a mango orchard close to the border of present-day Bangladesh. This battle	71.70399475097656	270.6715087890625	12.0	451.2040252685547	59
became famous as a turning-point in the history of South Asia. It took place in the small	71.70399475097656	284.47149658203125	12.0	451.23802185058594	59

colonial rule in South Asia, a rule that would last till 1947’. (Willem: 2009). And Bangladesh	71.70399475097656	353.4714660644531	12.0	451.05601501464844	59

as mentioned by Max Weber. They introduced the same bureaucratic structure (as apparatus	71.70399475097656	450.0914611816406	12.0	451.33604431152344	59

the state bureaucracy to establish their well-being. In that sense, the interpretations of state	71.70399475097656	560.521484375	12.0	451.37205505371094	59

authority. But what is the real scene exist in nature. It will be clear by understanding state and	71.70399475097656	298.511474609375	12.0	450.92405700683594	66
bureaucratic nature in this country. In Democratic system in Bangladesh, Politicians claim for	71.70399475097656	312.31146240234375	12.0	451.51597595214844	66
power is based on popular mandate while that of bureaucrats on merit, competence and	71.70399475097656	326.1114501953125	12.0	451.2119598388672	66
political backing. (Anisuzzaman: 2012). One the other hand, politician need to pursue for	71.70399475097656	339.9114685058594	12.0	451.27391052246094	66
getting nomination for election to the bureaucrats. According to Zafarullah, ‘Bureaucrats can	71.70399475097656	353.7114562988281	12.0	451.24595642089844	66
have considerable impact on governance because of their ability to mobilize political support	71.70399475097656	367.511474609375	12.0	450.9960174560547	66
and to apply or deny their administrative skills and technical expertise’. (Zafarullah: 1992).	71.70399475097656	381.31146240234375	12.0	437.6280059814453	66
He also added that it (Bureaucracy) is no longer the neutral instrument of policy	100.01998901367188	395.1314697265625	12.0	423.0659484863281	66
implementation in the hands of politicians.’ (Zafarullah: 1992). But in western bureaucracy	71.70399475097656	408.93145751953125	12.0	451.3079071044922	66
still remains structurally subordinate to politics. (Ahmed: 2009). In that context, the	71.70399475097656	422.7314758300781	12.0	451.2119598388672	66
theoretical explanation of Hamza Alavi is right; the state bureaucracy of Bangladesh is	71.70399475097656	436.5314636230469	12.0	450.90806579589844	66
autonomous. In the question of rational bureaucracy, P.K. Agrawal stated that any person	71.70399475097656	450.3314514160156	12.0	451.01597595214844	66
who enters the bureaucratic organization now wants to know what his authority is as regards	71.70399475097656	464.1314697265625	12.0	450.9960174560547	66
his domain of activities. Authority tends to power; power breeds ego; and ego creates	71.70399475097656	477.93145751953125	12.0	451.1160125732422	66
favoritism. …the ego may be different for different persons according to the environment.	71.70399475097656	491.7314758300781	12.0	432.30003356933594	66
Therefore, ego though purely an internal factor gets liked with external factors	100.01998901367188	505.531494140625	12.0	422.6160583496094	66
comprising family and kinship, caste and religion, language and region, social economic	71.70399475097656	519.3314208984375	12.0	451.0800018310547	66
strata….. this leads to inaction legalized in many way. (Agrawal: 1995). But in Bangladesh,	71.70399475097656	533.1314697265625	12.0	451.02000427246094	66
persons enter into bureaucracy by pursuing others not on the basis on merit always. This is	71.70399475097656	546.9314575195312	12.0	451.44395446777344	66
defined the characteristics of nepotism in public administration in Bangladesh.	71.70399475097656	560.761474609375	12.0	377.0160369873047	66
According to Jacoby, ‘He (Weber) considered official administrative activity as	100.01998901367188	574.5614624023438	12.0	422.5560607910156	66
separated from the private sphere of life, and as a condition which had developed over a long	71.70399475097656	588.3614501953125	12.0	451.45603942871094	66
period of time.’ (Jacoby: 1976). But in Bangladesh, official administrations are not free from	71.70399475097656	602.1614990234375	12.0	450.97203063964844	66
private sphere of bureaucrat’s life. Still it is difficult for Bangladesh to keep out from such	71.70399475097656	615.96142578125	12.0	451.05601501464844	66
kinds of patriarchy nature of Bureaucracy.	71.70399475097656	629.761474609375	12.0	203.0640106201172	66
The common features of Bangladesh Bureaucracy	71.70399475097656	657.6014404296875	12.0	255.46400451660156	67
In essence, the nature of Bureaucracy in Bangladesh shaped by irrational domination	100.01998901367188	677.1614990234375	12.0	422.8199768066406	68
historically. In independent Bangladesh, Politicization of Bureaucracy as well as corruption	71.70399475097656	690.96142578125	12.0	451.04405212402344	68
in state bureaucracy emerged tremendously. According to Ishtiaq Jamil, `Bureaucracy in	71.70399475097656	704.781494140625	12.0	451.1739959716797	68
Bangladesh is now caught in the tug-of-war between the major political parties, especially the	71.70399475097656	718.5814819335938	12.0	451.0940399169922	68
party and their allies in power. Their transfer and posting to suitable locations and positions,	71.70399475097656	732.3814697265625	12.0	450.98399353027344	68

process of manipulating the career of bureaucrats has also led to the division among	71.70399475097656	99.04150390625	12.0	451.03196716308594	71
bureaucrats along party lines. He also added that, ‘Political connections are now considered	71.70399475097656	112.84149169921875	12.0	451.02000427246094	71
vital for promotion, transfer, posting and even recruitment’. (Jamil: 2007). In a recent study	71.70399475097656	126.6414794921875	12.0	451.5759735107422	71
on `State of bureaucracy in Bangladesh and its reform’, Shahidujjaman Khan elicited that the	71.70399475097656	140.44146728515625	12.0	451.17601013183594	71
bureaucracy in the country badly suffered due to politicization of the administration. He	71.70399475097656	154.24151611328125	12.0	451.60801696777344	71
found that promotions and transfers of the civil servants in the past were entirely on political	71.70399475097656	168.04150390625	12.0	451.31199645996094	71
considerations and a large number of officers, having requisite qualifications, were deprived	71.70399475097656	181.84149169921875	12.0	451.00999450683594	71
of due promotions, which created a commotion in the civil administration.	71.70399475097656	195.6414794921875	12.0	356.65000915527344	71
He also added that `Bureaucracy has, indeed, a sweeping dominance in the state	100.01998901367188	209.44146728515625	12.0	422.7420349121094	71
administration of Bangladesh. The neutrality of the bureaucracy is critically threatened	71.70399475097656	223.24151611328125	12.0	450.8879852294922	71
because of undue influence by the political leaders. Such situation contributes to the	71.70399475097656	237.04150390625	12.0	451.35997009277344	71
unfairness and poor distribution of public service, which tends to boost the practices of	71.70399475097656	250.87152099609375	12.0	451.0199432373047	71
corruption, collusion and nepotism.’ (Khan: 2012). He finds out three kinds of problems with	71.70399475097656	264.6715087890625	12.0	451.2999725341797	71

First, as per Transparency International (TI) reports, Bangladesh is among the most	107.69998931884766	306.07147216796875	12.0	415.05001068115234	72
corrupt countries in the world. The performance of the bureaucracy in Bangladesh is	107.69998931884766	319.87152099609375	11.999969482421875	415.1760482788086	72

Khan clearly mentioned that `Bangladesh inherited the system of bureaucracy from the	100.01998901367188	450.0914611816406	12.0	422.8939514160156	75
British that ruled Indian subcontinent for over 200 years. The UK government has reformed	71.70399475097656	463.8914489746094	12.0	451.12803649902344	75
the bureaucracy by completely transforming its civil service, making it more accountable to	71.70399475097656	477.69146728515625	12.0	451.1399383544922	75
ordinary citizens. Some other countries went for drastic reform of their civil administration.	71.70399475097656	491.491455078125	12.0	451.28599548339844	75
Since independence, Bangladesh has had at least 18 proposals for reform in the bureaucracy.	71.70399475097656	505.29150390625	12.0	451.0319061279297	75
