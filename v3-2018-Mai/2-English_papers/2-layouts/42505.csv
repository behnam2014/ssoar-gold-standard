agement of the commons requires long-term strategies that private actors	40.49009704589844	302.68450927734375	10.5	297.5668487548828	18

Yoweri Museveni justified this decision on the grounds that the country	82.97019958496094	248.2198486328125	10.5	297.63291931152344	23

maintained that the success of the country’s economy depended on the	82.97360229492188	342.7230529785156	10.5	297.5826110839844	23

Museveni’s line of argument follows a neoliberal logic holding that	60.345703125	78.170654296875	10.5	277.7962951660156	29
what is good for business is good for the country. There appears to be	40.490203857421875	89.99365234375	10.5	297.50274658203125	29
no place in his thinking for the concerns of local communities, which are	40.490203857421875	101.816650390625	10.5	297.44610595703125	29
so vital for sustainable development centred on the protection of the	40.490203857421875	113.6396484375	10.5	297.6225280761719	29
commons. Baden and Stroup (1977: 235) sum up the tension resulting	40.490203857421875	125.462646484375	10.5	297.5384521484375	29
from the impossibility of quantifying the value of using the commons for	40.490203857421875	137.22265625	10.5	297.689697265625	29
non-extractive purposes as follows: “We know, for example, how much	40.490203857421875	149.045654296875	10.5	297.6435241699219	29

how much would they pay for a day’s access to a wilderness area?” The	40.490203857421875	172.691650390625	10.5	297.6088562011719	29
Ugandan government’s path dependency explains why it is unwilling to	40.490203857421875	184.5146484375	10.5	297.62982177734375	29

Countering such criticism, the Ugandan government has argued that	60.345703125	219.983642578125	10.5	277.7292175292969	29
the part of Mabira Forest being allocated to private concession either	40.490203857421875	231.74365234375	10.5	297.6665954589844	29

However, the government has not addressed reports indicating that	40.490203857421875	255.3896484375	10.5	297.6622314453125	29

twenty lorry loads of illegally logged timber were being hauled from	40.490203857421875	290.858642578125	10.5	297.6329650878906	29

Soon after taking over power, Museveni was faced with a military	60.345603942871094	149.04852294921875	10.5	277.7722854614258	64

grammes. Uganda adopted policies of market liberalisation, privatisation	40.49010467529297	208.16351318359375	10.5	297.6066665649414	64

the state generally. The implementation of such measures required a	40.49010467529297	231.74652099609375	10.5	297.74845123291016	64
political rigidity that contradicted the call for “liberalisation” in any sense	40.49010467529297	243.56951904296875	10.5	297.6476516723633	64

2006: 30; Mamdani 1994: 557). The results are plain to see. The 2006	40.49010467529297	361.73651123046875	10.5	297.7274856567383	64
presidential elections were reduced to a contest between Museveni and his	40.49010467529297	373.55950927734375	10.5	297.72110748291016	64

Besigye had first been held on charges of treason and rape, then, when he	40.49010467529297	397.20550537109375	10.5	297.6067886352539	64

As an example, Makara cited the role of the Electoral Commission,	40.49010467529297	491.72650146484375	10.5	297.6519546508789	64

As discussed earlier, the Mabira Forest movement does not result from a	82.97019958496094	366.34814453125	10.5	297.66236877441406	88

was the collusion between an increasingly unaccountable president who	82.968994140625	314.4748229980469	10.5	297.6203918457031	96
