1. Introduction	72.02400207519531	117.0589599609375	12.0	75.3599853515625	13
Late 20th century can be described as a flourishing period of the democratic societies’ development. Before	72.02400207519531	130.73895263671875	12.0	468.12400817871094	13
World War II, only 28% of countries worldwide claimed to be democratic. By the end of 20th century,	72.02400207519531	144.53900146484375	12.0	468.14805603027344	13
particularly after the fall of the Berlin wall, this figure increased to 62%. Whether the process of the	72.02400207519531	158.3389892578125	12.0	467.98594665527344	13
democratization of the societies will continue, depends mostly on the citizens’ willingness to be actively	72.02400207519531	172.13897705078125	12.0	467.5559539794922	13
involved in political and civic activities, such as: defining issues, policy making, solving public problems,	72.02400207519531	185.8189697265625	12.0	468.06394958496094	13
taking responsibility for building communities, and participating in the political and electoral processes.	72.02400207519531	199.61895751953125	12.0	443.95225524902344	13
According to William Damon (2001), the process of the democratization worldwide is not moving in	108.0199966430664	213.4189453125	12.0	432.01998138427734	13
the right direction in particular because of the civic and political disengagement of the young people.	72.02400207519531	227.218994140625	12.0	468.05198669433594	13
Indifference is the greatest in mature democracies, but is apparent in many new democracies or	72.02400207519531	240.89898681640625	12.0	468.2200164794922	13
problematic one. Today, as he claims, the general young people’s attitude towards democracy is apathy or	72.02400207519531	254.72900390625	12.0	468.11204528808594	13
cynicism.	72.02400207519531	268.52899169921875	11.999969482421875	40.40399932861328	13
On the other hand, higher education is recognized as key to delivering the knowledge requirements	108.0199966430664	282.3289489746094	12.0	431.90608978271484	13
for political development. It is essential for the design and operation of key political institutions of a modern	72.02400207519531	296.0089416503906	12.0	467.6781463623047	13
political system, from the judiciary to the legislative and executive arms of government, the top staffing of	72.02400207519531	309.8089294433594	12.0	467.4961395263672	13
the state bureaucracy as well as key institutions of civil society. Moreover, public higher education in	72.02400207519531	323.60894775390625	12.0	467.96214294433594	13
democracies is typically mandated to contribute to the development of an enlightened, critically constructive	72.02400207519531	337.408935546875	12.0	467.5801239013672	13
citizenry (Luescher-Mamashela, 2011: 9).	72.02400207519531	351.0889587402344	12.0	180.97996520996094	13
Hence, many researchers, with significant funding from foundations, have focused on the college	108.0199966430664	364.8889465332031	12.0	431.99593353271484	13
student demographic to assess the civic and political health of the nation’s new generations. Results show	72.02400207519531	378.6889343261719	12.0	467.53208923339844	13
a generation that is both disconnected from conventional politics, and yet has much civic potential. There is	72.02400207519531	392.48895263671875	12.0	467.42417907714844	13
widespread evidence, along with a general characterization in the media, that college students today are	72.02400207519531	406.1689453125	12.0	467.5638885498047	13
cynical and apathetic about politics. Survey research has also demonstrated that young people are	72.02400207519531	419.96893310546875	12.0	467.5681610107422	13
considerably less knowledgeable of and interested in political affairs (Longo and Meyer, 2006: 5).	72.02400207519531	433.7889404296875	12.0	422.53602600097656	13
Having in mind that the Republic of Macedonia is considered to be a young democracy, the	108.0199966430664	447.46893310546875	12.0	431.49605560302734	13
discussion pertaining to the relevance and significance of democracy is one of the most contested issues in	72.02400207519531	461.2689514160156	12.0	467.63999938964844	13
the political and academic debates in the Republic of Macedonia. The issue of democracy, as well as the	72.02400207519531	475.0689392089844	12.0	467.7020721435547	13
issue of the citizens’ engagement in political and civic activities, is of a great importance particularly having	72.02400207519531	488.86895751953125	12.0	467.55601501464844	13
in mind the fact that a stable democratic regime does not only require well-designed and functioning	72.02400207519531	502.5489501953125	12.0	468.00413513183594	13
political institutions and processes to be sustainable and consolidated; it requires democrats (Mattes et al.	72.02400207519531	516.331787109375	12.01715087890625	468.13609313964844	13

‘Democracy’ is one of the most used and arguable concepts in more recent history, particularly after the fall	72.02400207519531	354.0889587402344	12.0	467.5561981201172	23
of the Berlin Wall. Definitions and operationalization of this concept vary quite a bit. Hence, even though	72.02400207519531	367.8889465332031	12.0	467.7941131591797	23
there is no universally accepted definition, there are two approaches in defining democracy: ‘minimal’ and	72.02400207519531	381.5689392089844	12.0	467.77403259277344	23
‘maximal’. The first one focuses on the importance of ‘means’, that is, procedures such as fair elections,	72.02400207519531	395.36895751953125	12.0	467.5320281982422	23
respect for human rights, and universal suffrage. In contrast, maximal definitions include not only	72.02400207519531	409.1689453125	12.0	468.1000213623047	23
democratic procedures but also ‘ends’, or outputs (such as economic equality and social services)	72.02400207519531	422.98895263671875	12.0	467.66429138183594	23

Democracy in political theory is described as a political philosophy, but also as a form of governing	108.0199966430664	450.46893310546875	12.0	431.5560531616211	23
where the governing power lies in the hands of people, and it may be exercised either in an immediate	72.02400207519531	464.2689514160156	12.0	467.5201873779297	23
(direct democracy) or intermediate manner (indirect democracy), i.e. according to the principle of	72.02400207519531	477.9489440917969	12.0	467.5802459716797	23
presentation and representation of interests realized by virtue of free and fair elections. Modern or	72.02400207519531	491.7489318847656	12.0	467.93797302246094	23
contemporary interpretation of democracy is connected with the philosophical principle of equal rights.	72.02400207519531	505.5489501953125	12.0	467.5680389404297	23
Hence, the notion of democracy is occasionally used in the context of liberal democracy, which on the other	72.02400207519531	519.3489379882812	12.0	468.2319793701172	23
hand implies existence of certain additional elements, such as political pluralism, equality before the law,	72.02400207519531	533.0289306640625	12.0	467.5442352294922	23
civil freedoms and civil rights, i.e. all the agents in a civil society. Furthermore, these elements represent a	72.02400207519531	546.8289794921875	12.0	467.49607849121094	23

Different scholars define democracy in different ways. Definitions of democracy often are	108.0199966430664	103.25897216796875	12.0	431.95406341552734	28
influenced by the aspect they emphasize. For example: some of the definitions focus on the institutions and	72.02400207519531	117.04180908203125	12.01715087890625	468.1239471435547	28

into account the social dimension i.e. social benefits.	72.02400207519531	144.5218505859375	12.01715087890625	228.74598693847656	28
These three broad alternatives—institutions and procedures, freedom and liberties, and social	108.0199966430664	158.3389892578125	12.0	431.86202239990234	28

Despite many definitions and different approaches in defining democracy, political theory highlights	108.0199966430664	254.72900390625	12.0	431.99007415771484	28
three pillars that underpin democracy: transparency, accountability and right to participate. Therefore,	72.02400207519531	268.52899169921875	11.999969482421875	467.59214782714844	28

According to Oxford Dictionary of Politics, political participation refers to taking part in politics. Although	72.02400207519531	389.60894775390625	12.0	467.4600067138672	36
political discussion does not fit in with this classic definition of political participation, yet it is an important	72.02400207519531	403.408935546875	12.0	468.07603454589844	36

With reference to the interest in politics, the results indicate that the largest number of respondents	108.0199966430664	127.97900390625	12.0	431.61592864990234	49
are partly interested in these issues, but at the same time they indicate that almost one half of the	72.02400207519531	141.77899169921875	12.0	467.94993591308594	49
respondents discuss politics even though they are not interested in it. This may be due to the ongoing	72.02400207519531	155.458984375	12.0	467.36399841308594	49
process of democratic transition and the continual changes in each and every segment of social life. This is	72.02400207519531	169.25897216796875	12.0	467.60423278808594	49

Citizen engagement may be defined as a process in which ordinary people take part – whether on a	72.02400207519531	251.968994140625	12.0	468.08799743652344	50

decision involving significant choices that will affect their community. Such engagement may or may not	72.02400207519531	279.448974609375	11.999969482421875	467.73814392089844	50
take place within an institutional framework, and it may be organized either by members of civil society (for	72.02400207519531	293.2489318847656	12.0	467.42430114746094	50
example, through class action, demonstrations, citizens’ committees, etc.) or by decision-makers (for	72.02400207519531	307.0489501953125	12.0	468.0640106201172	50

The study ‘Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia’ elaborates on the civic engagement of	108.0199966430664	375.79180908203125	12.017120361328125	431.79793548583984	51
young people in Macedonia, as within the educational institutions, and in a broader social context.	72.02400207519531	389.60894775390625	12.0	468.19200134277344	51
According to the collected data, 43, 6% of the young involved in the educational process take part in setting	72.02400207519531	403.408935546875	12.0	467.97410583496094	51
requirements within the school/university. A slightly lower percentage of respondents (33%) at least	72.02400207519531	417.2089538574219	12.0	467.6039276123047	51
sometimes resort to protests that have not been announced, but which they regard as fair.	72.02400207519531	430.908935546875	12.0	391.4762420654297	51
As far as the civic engagement of young people in a wider social context is concerned (beyond the	108.0199966430664	444.7089538574219	12.0	431.6822738647461	51
educational institutions), somewhat different results have been obtained – a lower engagement on the part	72.02400207519531	458.5089416503906	12.0	467.96202087402344	51
of the young has been registered. Namely, 29,4% of the young take part in setting requirements, whereas	72.02400207519531	472.3089294433594	12.0	468.08799743652344	51
34,2% of the young have at least once signed a petition or have resorted to certain previously announced	72.02400207519531	485.98895263671875	12.0	467.48411560058594	51
protests. A slightly lower percentage of respondents (27, 9%) at least sometimes resort to protests that	72.02400207519531	499.7889404296875	12.0	467.5922088623047	51
have not been announced, but which they regard as fair (Cekic, 2014: 67, 68).	72.02400207519531	513.5889892578125	12.0	339.6380157470703	51
Although non-political in its nature, participation in socially useful work i.e. in non-profit services for	108.0199966430664	527.3889770507812	12.000015258789062	432.2240219116211	51
the benefit of the community is another fundamental aspect of democratic society and democratic	72.02400207519531	541.0689697265625	12.0	468.14805603027344	51
citizenship. Participation in civic associations is not just important only because it develops civic skills, but	72.02400207519531	554.8689575195312	12.0	468.01597595214844	51
also because it is critical to establishing social and political networks that are so important for political	72.02400207519531	568.6689453125	12.0	468.18406677246094	51
activity. Associating with other citizens about any interest on any basis increases the probability of	72.02400207519531	582.468994140625	12.0	468.0640106201172	51
establishing contact with government and for active involvement in politics. As Nie and Hillygus (2001)	72.02400207519531	596.178955078125	12.0	468.0758514404297	51
claim, even members of a garden club can be drawn into politics because the government controls what	72.02400207519531	609.9789428710938	12.0	468.1720428466797	51
seeds can be grown and what fertilizers should be used.	72.02400207519531	623.7789306640625	12.0	245.11402893066406	51
Hence, the findings in terms of youth engagement in civic associations in Macedonia, presented in	108.0199966430664	637.5789794921875	12.0	431.6041488647461	51
the study ‘Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia’, may even be regarded pessimistic. Namely, a high	72.02400207519531	651.2418212890625	12.01715087890625	467.9260711669922	51
percentage of young people, i.e. 53, 8% are not members of any organization. As for those that are	72.02400207519531	665.0589599609375	12.0	467.48387145996094	51

One of the crucial indicators pertaining to the engagement of the young people in politics is the use	108.0199966430664	158.3389892578125	12.0	431.48409271240234	56
of the democratic right to vote. Voting represents a higher level of political activity compared to the	72.02400207519531	172.13897705078125	12.0	467.73814392089844	56
previously processed ones and is the most immediate way to assess the attitude of the young towards	72.02400207519531	185.8189697265625	12.0	467.5198211669922	56
politics (for example whether it is a case of apathy, etc.). Unfortunately, there is no information about voter	72.02400207519531	199.61895751953125	12.0	468.08811950683594	56
turnout in Macedonia with reference to age groups, which further implies that only research-based data	72.02400207519531	213.4189453125	12.0	468.0640106201172	56
may be used as indicators of this phenomenon.	72.02400207519531	227.218994140625	12.0	206.1719512939453	56
According to the findings presented in ‘Youth Study Macedonia 2013’, 41% of the young	108.0199966430664	240.8818359375	12.01715087890625	432.0079574584961	56
responded that they have always voted at elections, whereas 31% responded that they have voted several	72.02400207519531	254.72900390625	12.0	467.47227478027344	56
times. Having in mind that 19% of the respondents are not eligible to vote, only 7% of the young people	72.02400207519531	268.52899169921875	11.999969482421875	467.43601989746094	56
responded that they have never voted. Hence, the authors of this study are of the opinion that there are	72.02400207519531	282.3289489746094	12.0	467.79808044433594	56
other reasons that motivate the young people to go out and vote having in mind that the interest in politics	72.02400207519531	296.0089416503906	12.0	467.5200653076172	56
on the part of the young is noticeably lower. In conformity with the data obtained, it is the ethnic	72.02400207519531	309.8089294433594	12.0	468.12400817871094	56
Macedonians that most often vote in elections, whereas the ethnic Albanians and members of the smaller	72.02400207519531	323.60894775390625	12.0	467.41197204589844	56
communities more seldom vote. The difference among ethnic communities grouped in such a way is	72.02400207519531	337.408935546875	12.0	467.60411071777344	56
approximately 10%. (Topuzovska Latkovikj et all. 2013).	72.02400207519531	351.0889587402344	12.0	246.26197814941406	56
As far as the same question is concerned, there are minor discrepancies among the data obtained	108.0199966430664	364.8889465332031	12.0	431.4601058959961	56
from the survey research ‘Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia’ which may be due to the provided	72.02400207519531	378.67181396484375	12.017120361328125	467.9139862060547	56
modalities9. According to this survey research, approximately one half of the respondents almost always	72.02400207519531	392.48895263671875	12.0	467.81004333496094	56
vote (49, 8%), 22, 7% sometimes use their right to vote, and only 7, 3% of the respondents stated that they	72.02400207519531	406.1689453125	12.0	467.58787536621094	56
have never voted (having in mind that the target group of the survey research was young people between	72.02400207519531	419.96893310546875	12.0	468.04002380371094	56
15 and 29 years of age, 20, 2% are not eligible to vote). Excluding the young people who are not eligible to	72.02400207519531	433.7889404296875	12.0	467.47190856933594	56
vote, it could be inferred that 58% of the young who are eligible to vote have almost always voted, whereas	72.02400207519531	447.46893310546875	12.0	467.48399353027344	56
28, 5% have voted sometimes (Cekic: 2014: 64, 65).	72.02400207519531	461.2689514160156	12.0	228.6200714111328	56

By employing the Likert scale ranging from 1 to 10 (1 being ‘I do not trust them at all’, and 10 being	108.0199966430664	543.948974609375	12.0	431.50789642333984	56
‘I trust them completely’) and referring to 10 social groups and individuals, the young people expressed	72.02400207519531	557.7489624023438	12.0	467.4600067138672	56
their level of trust. The trust they have towards the political leaders and towards the people with different	72.02400207519531	571.428955078125	12.0	467.4841766357422	56
political convictions is the lowest. As far as the political leaders are concerned, the mean value is 3, 18,	72.02400207519531	585.2289428710938	12.0	468.13597106933594	56
whereas the level of trust towards people with different political convictions is characterized by a mean	72.02400207519531	599.0589599609375	12.0	467.58006286621094	56
value of 4, 29, which may be a sole indicator of the existence of a politicized and a divided society.	72.02400207519531	612.8589477539062	12.0	428.00804138183594	56
Additionally, the figures regarding the trust towards the political parties are the lowest compared to	108.0199966430664	626.5389404296875	12.0	431.56807708740234	56

According to Youth Study Macedonia 2013, as far as the satisfaction with reference to democratic	108.0199966430664	307.0318298339844	12.017120361328125	431.8821029663086	64
development of the Macedonian society is concerned, the mean value of answers from the overall sample	72.02400207519531	320.72894287109375	12.0	467.47203063964844	64

Girls are more satisfied with the democratic development (M=2, 85) as opposed to boys (M=2, 63) and the	72.02400207519531	348.3289489746094	12.0	467.48411560058594	64
same applies to the members of the Albanian ethnic community (M=2, 54) as opposed to the members of	72.02400207519531	362.1289367675781	12.0	467.4840545654297	64
the Macedonian ethnic community (M=2, 39). There is a statistically significant difference in both presented	72.02400207519531	375.8089294433594	12.0	467.8340301513672	64
cases (T. Latkovikj et all. 2013: 112). The fact that the members of the Albanian ethnic community are more	72.02400207519531	389.60894775390625	12.0	467.76194763183594	64
satisfied with the democratic development in the Republic of Macedonia compared to the Macedonians is	72.02400207519531	403.408935546875	12.0	468.0040740966797	64
probably due to the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement10, in particular concessions	72.02400207519531	417.2089538574219	12.0	468.08799743652344	64

of young Albanians fully corresponds with the attitude of the wider Albanian community. Namely, members	72.02400207519531	444.7089538574219	12.0	467.81004333496094	64

Probably, due to the fact that young Albanian respondents are more satisfied with the democratic	108.0199966430664	499.7889404296875	12.0	431.7780990600586	64

constitution and other major laws, education and language matters, as well as the expression of identity. The Agreement was	72.02400207519531	617.7650756835938	9.960006713867188	467.4227752685547	65

11 It primarily refers to the use of languages of the ethnic communities. According to the Ohrid Framework Agreement the official	72.02400207519531	640.8051147460938	9.960006713867188	467.8710174560547	65
language throughout Macedonia and in the international relations of Macedonia is the Macedonian language. But - as stated in	72.02400207519531	652.2051391601562	9.960006713867188	468.0345916748047	65
the Agreement - with respect to local self-government, in municipalities where a community comprises at least 20 percent of the	72.02400207519531	663.72509765625	9.960006713867188	467.85154724121094	65
population of the municipality, the language of that community will be used as an official language in addition to Macedonian.	72.02400207519531	675.2451171875	9.960006713867188	467.8425750732422	65

But, first of all, we should consider the overall data from Youth Study Macedonia 2013 regarding	108.0199966430664	103.2418212890625	12.01715087890625	432.1279525756836	69
this issue. Namely, one half of the respondents, i.e. 53% of the young people, is thinking of (31%) or has	72.02400207519531	117.0589599609375	12.0	468.0879364013672	69
already decided (22%) to leave Macedonia. The most desired destination among the young people is the	72.02400207519531	130.73895263671875	12.0	467.5081024169922	69

As before mentioned, there are noticeably different migration trends among the young Macedonian	108.0199966430664	199.61895751953125	12.0	431.5561752319336	69

In 2001 - as a result of the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement a new political	108.0199966430664	494.98895263671875	12.0	432.0379867553711	88
pattern was inaugurated in Macedonia. Hence, it is of great importance to take into consideration the	72.02400207519531	508.7889404296875	12.0	467.5320281982422	88
attitudes of young people towards the type of society (in terms of political pattern) they would like to live in.	72.02400207519531	522.4689331054688	12.0	468.04014587402344	88

respondents opted for civil, 39, 5% for multicultural and 2, and 4% opted for bi-ethnic. The greatest	72.02400207519531	550.0689697265625	12.0	468.0759735107422	88
statistically relevant difference is evident when this question is analyzed from the aspect of ethnicity.	72.02400207519531	563.7489624023438	12.0	434.9380645751953	88
It may be inferred that the percentage of respondents that are in favour of the civil society is higher	108.0199966430664	577.5489501953125	12.0	431.5320053100586	88
among the Macedonian students, whereas the percentage of respondents that are in favour of the	72.02400207519531	591.3489379882812	12.0	467.50804138183594	88

It is evident that the division among the ethnic communities in Macedonia - particularly accentuated	108.0199966430664	361.7689514160156	12.0	432.05599212646484	108
between the Macedonian majority and the biggest ethnic community (Albanian) – is reflected in different	72.02400207519531	375.5689392089844	12.0	468.1479949951172	108
views and opinions regarding the concept of the political pattern. In other words, young Albanians prefer	72.02400207519531	389.2489318847656	12.0	467.9619598388672	108
multicultural society rather than civil one. It should be emphasized that the newly inaugurated political	72.02400207519531	403.0489501953125	12.0	467.78611755371094	108
pattern shifted the focal point from individual to collective rights (the ethnic ones) and on behalf of the larger	72.02400207519531	416.84893798828125	12.0	467.87815856933594	108
communities, thus enabling the individual to realize his/her rights (economic, social, cultural, political)	72.02400207519531	430.6689453125	12.0	467.5680389404297	108
through the ethnic community they belong to. This political pattern inevitably leads to a sheer model of	72.02400207519531	444.34893798828125	12.0	467.3520965576172	108
ethnic pluralism with elements of consociational democracy instead to the declared multicultural	72.02400207519531	458.1489562988281	12.0	467.6641082763672	108

The democratization of the Macedonian society – as a society in democratic transition – is largely	72.02400207519531	527.0289306640625	12.0	468.16001892089844	109
dependent on the democratic awareness of its citizens and their political viewpoints and values. In this	72.02400207519531	540.8289794921875	12.0	467.59214782714844	109
context, the willingness of the citizens and of the young people in particular is of pivotal importance with	72.02400207519531	554.5089721679688	12.0	467.46006774902344	109

Nonetheless, the findings from the conducted research in Macedonia point out to certain	108.0199966430664	582.1089477539062	12.0	431.4480209350586	109
indifference and disengagement in terms of the political and civic activities of the young people.	72.02400207519531	595.93896484375	12.0	413.9160919189453	109
The fact that there are major differences among the young people pertaining to their interest in	108.0199966430664	609.6189575195312	12.0	431.5680160522461	109
politics and their satisfaction with the democratic development of the society is of particular interest and it is	72.02400207519531	623.4189453125	12.0	467.5800018310547	109
worth highlighting. This fact is even more remarkable from the aspect of their ethnicity.	72.02400207519531	637.218994140625	12.0	375.17005920410156	109
Namely, the young people of Albanian ethnicity, as opposed to the young Macedonians, are more	108.0199966430664	651.0189819335938	12.0	431.4481430053711	109
interested, discuss politics more and are consequently much more informed about the current political	72.02400207519531	664.698974609375	12.0	467.5802459716797	109
affairs in the Republic of Macedonia. This is probably due to the fact that the Albanian ethnic community in	72.02400207519531	678.4989624023438	12.0	467.44407653808594	109
Macedonia is of the opinion that the ethnic issues (minority and cultural rights) have not been fully realized,	72.02400207519531	692.294921875	12.0	467.5442352294922	109
and hence their interest in the current political affairs in the country is greater. The different viewpoints and	72.02400207519531	706.094970703125	12.0	467.83409118652344	109

visions concerning the political structure further prove this. The young Macedonians, who constitute a	72.02400207519531	103.25897216796875	12.0	467.5680389404297	113
majority, would like the Macedonian society to be a civic, as opposed to the young Albanians who envisage	72.02400207519531	117.0589599609375	12.0	468.1000213623047	113

On the other hand, certain contradiction has been ascertained regarding the level of satisfaction	108.0199966430664	144.53900146484375	12.0	431.56807708740234	113
with the democratic development of the society in the case of the young Albanians. Compared to the other	72.02400207519531	158.3389892578125	12.0	467.55613708496094	113

democratic development of the society. Hence, the percentage of respondents who stated that they would	72.02400207519531	185.8189697265625	12.0	467.5320281982422	113

As for the engagement in civic associations, there are no differences pertaining to ethnicity. The	108.0199966430664	227.218994140625	12.0	431.50814056396484	113

non-existence of awareness regarding the relevance and significance of such engagement. Namely,	72.02400207519531	254.72900390625	12.0	468.19200134277344	113
participation in civic associations is not just important because it develops civic skills, but also because it is	72.02400207519531	268.52899169921875	11.999969482421875	468.1481170654297	113
