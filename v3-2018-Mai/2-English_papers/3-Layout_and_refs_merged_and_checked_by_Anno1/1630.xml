After the accession to the European Union in 2004 and 2007, political actors of	85.08000183105469	345.7098083496094	12.0	439.28163146972656	5
new member states are equally represented in all EU institutions. In addition to the	85.08001708984375	359.5097961425781	12.0	439.44842529296875	5

East European Member States (EU-8) act in the new surrounding, given that all	85.08001708984375	442.3097229003906	12.0	439.3944091796875	5
EU-institutions themselves are much more heterogeneous and in a process of	85.08001708984375	456.1097106933594	12.0	439.3511962890625	5

lobbying, negotiating and bargaining still is in need of a necessary fine-tuning, the	85.08001708984375	497.5096740722656	12.0	439.40643310546875	5
aim of this paper is to highlight constellations in the field of EU cohesion policy, in	85.08001708984375	511.3096923828125	12.0	439.372802734375	5
which actors of this Brussels scene were - although regarded as a peripheral	85.08001708984375	525.109619140625	12.0	439.35601806640625	5
group - able through formal and informal exchange of knowledge to act as	85.08001708984375	538.90966796875	12.0	439.2071533203125	5

Factors influencing the arena of negotiations are, firstly, whether participants are -	85.08000183105469	566.5098266601562	12.0	439.3151397705078	5
at a societal-cultural level - able to react in an adequate manner. This personal	85.07998657226562	580.309814453125	12.0	439.3644104003906	5
disposition is based on working experience and the study background, thus the	85.07998657226562	594.10986328125	12.0	439.3703918457031	5
level of socialisation in an international and European-oriented context. The	85.07998657226562	607.9098510742188	12.0	439.4087829589844	5
second vector of influence is based on the national background and on domestic	85.07997131347656	621.7098388671875	12.0	439.23838806152344	5
politics: Which is the room of manoeuvre for participants to act as promoter or	85.0799560546875	635.5098876953125	12.0	439.3919677734375	5

Introduction	85.08000183105469	73.33514404296875	12.0	69.9696044921875	8
When you know how the EU machinery is working, then the process of policy-	85.08000183105469	100.5498046875	12.0	439.2743682861328	9
making increasingly becomes a creative process.	85.08001708984375	114.34979248046875	12.0	261.439208984375	9
After the accession to the European Union in 2004 and 2007, political actors of	85.08000183105469	141.9498291015625	12.0	439.28163146972656	10
former communist countries are equally represented in all EU institutions. In	85.08001708984375	155.74981689453125	12.0	439.34881591796875	10
addition to the political level, a huge body of medium to high-level administrative	85.08001708984375	169.5498046875	12.0	439.3631591796875	10
staff and lobbyists has moved to this specific European labour market. While	85.08001708984375	183.34979248046875	12.0	439.35601806640625	10
working as politicians, officials or lobbyists in the institutional structures of the EU,	85.08001708984375	197.08978271484375	12.0	439.28997802734375	10
these actors get in dept acquainted with the Brussels style of working and the	85.08001708984375	210.8897705078125	12.0	439.35723876953125	10
elaborated code of negotiation. At the same time, these experts maintain a	85.08003234863281	224.68975830078125	12.0	439.3584442138672	10
frequent and regular exchange with actors on the national level, thus forming a	85.08003234863281	238.48974609375	12.0	439.35118103027344	10
specific “Brussels scene”.	85.08001708984375	252.28973388671875	12.01776123046875	136.09078979492188	10
Since the beginning of accession negotiations at the end of the 1990s, all	85.08000183105469	279.88983154296875	12.0	439.35963439941406	11
categories of actors have been familiarized with the Brussels administrative arena	85.08000183105469	293.6898193359375	12.0	439.2840118408203	11
and the negotiating style. They were able to gain working experience in EU-related	85.08000183105469	307.48980712890625	12.0	439.37037658691406	11
line ministries, organisations and political committees. After a phase of	85.07998657226562	321.289794921875	12.0	439.3247985839844	11
asymmetrical power constellations during the accession process, how can, after	85.07998657226562	335.08978271484375	12.0	439.2502746582031	11
2004, the real participation in the policy-making process in the enlarged EU of 25	85.07998657226562	348.8897705078125	12.0	439.2887878417969	11
Member States (EU-25) be characterized? How do the new participants of Central	85.07998657226562	362.68975830078125	12.0	439.3919982910156	11
and East European Member States (EU-8)1 act in the new surrounding, given that	85.07998657226562	374.00823974609375	14.4815673828125	439.3811950683594	11
all EU-institutions themselves are much more heterogeneous and in a process of	85.08001708984375	390.289794921875	12.0	439.3583984375	11
consolidation and adjustment? The year 2004 thus marked a new and at the same	85.08001708984375	404.08978271484375	12.0	439.249267578125	11
time unique situation for old and new Member States alike2.	85.08001708984375	415.4082336425781	14.4815673828125	317.0159912109375	11
Starting in 2004, negotiations for the Financial Perspective 2007-2013 with	85.08000183105469	445.48980712890625	12.017730712890625	439.3332061767578	12
implications for the EU Cohesion Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy	85.07998657226562	459.289794921875	12.017730712890625	439.3236389160156	12
(CAP) have been on the agenda for two years. The results as to financial	85.0799560546875	473.08978271484375	12.0	439.34637451171875	12
arrangements did not fully meet the expectations of delegations of new Member	85.0799560546875	486.8897705078125	12.0	439.33197021484375	12
States. Nevertheless some financially minor, but innovative aspects forwarded by	85.0799560546875	500.68975830078125	12.0	439.257568359375	12
actors of the EU-8 (by single delegations, by the group of EU-8 or by the Visegrád	85.0799560546875	514.48974609375	12.0177001953125	439.3199462890625	12
group) were incorporated in the new regulations. So they were partially able to	85.0799560546875	528.2897338867188	12.0	439.3968505859375	12
carve out creative niches.	85.0799560546875	542.0897216796875	12.0	136.10879516601562	12
In general, these lengthy negotiations were characterized by participants of the	85.08000183105469	569.6898193359375	12.0	439.29969787597656	13
new Member States as a “real learning area” and a “healthy ferment”3. This means	85.08000183105469	581.0082397460938	14.48162841796875	439.3667755126953	13
that inherent difficulties among the “newcomers” as well as misperceptions and	85.08001708984375	597.289794921875	12.0	439.35357666015625	13
non-acceptance among old Member States were part of the game: On the one	85.08001708984375	611.08984375	12.0	439.35595703125	13
hand, actors of the EU-8 did not yet possess of refined negotiation capacities and	85.08001708984375	624.8898315429688	12.0	439.3740234375	13
capabilities which include an openness to cooperate with different partners and to	85.08001708984375	638.6898193359375	12.0	439.29229736328125	13
have a feeling for the necessary early mobilization and for active formal and	85.08001708984375	652.4898681640625	12.0	439.1807861328125	13
1 To avoid repetition, the labels Central and Eastern Europe and EU-8 are used interchangeably for	85.08000183105469	678.673583984375	11.912643432617188	439.30543518066406	14
the new Member States of the accession round of 2004; the same applies to old Member States	85.08354187011719	692.0892333984375	10.020004272460938	439.36598205566406	14

2 This means that the institutional and policy arrangements of the enlarged EU are not yet “locked	85.08000183105469	713.173583984375	11.912635803222656	439.43055725097656	14

strong self-confidence and self-assertion of outstanding actors of Central and East	85.07998657226562	86.74981689453125	12.0	439.2431945800781	16
European Member States could be mentioned: The Polish delegation is blamed for	85.07998657226562	100.5498046875	12.0	439.4087829589844	16
an aggressive way of negotiating and of demonstrating a very national rhetoric as	85.08001708984375	114.34979248046875	12.0	439.28399658203125	16
to the Reform Treaty (Lang 2006; Langenohl/Westphal 2007: 7ff.).	85.08001708984375	128.1497802734375	12.01776123046875	350.95794677734375	16
On the other hand, the nature of established negotiation structures and codes of	85.08000183105469	155.74981689453125	12.0	439.2335968017578	17
conduct among old Member States made it difficult for newcomers to define and	85.07998657226562	169.5498046875	12.0	439.3871765136719	17
find trustworthy partners: in the different EU institutions defenders of the status	85.07998657226562	183.34979248046875	12.0	439.3091735839844	17
quo were reluctant to open the structures of long-established “inner circles” based	85.07998657226562	197.08978271484375	12.0	439.3559875488281	17
on and built upon long-shared experience to new groups and communities. This	85.07998657226562	210.8897705078125	12.0	439.2311706542969	17
has effectively counteracted the smooth integration of newcomers and has	85.07998657226562	224.68975830078125	12.0	439.3200378417969	17
complicated the effective participation in existing patterns of decision-making	85.07998657226562	238.48974609375	12.0	439.3392028808594	17
(Langenohl/Westphal 2006: 10). In consequence these factors have largely	85.08000183105469	252.28973388671875	12.0	439.2804718017578	17
hindered the emergence of inclusive modes of policy-making within different EU	85.08000183105469	266.0897216796875	12.0	439.32484436035156	17

Finally, this leads to the perception that even several years after the accession still	85.08000183105469	307.48980712890625	12.0	439.3380889892578	18
asymmetrical forms of bargaining and negotiations can be seen and that,	85.08001708984375	321.289794921875	12.0	439.275634765625	18
indirectly, power differentials among Member States are portrayed4. In addition the	85.08004760742188	334.2819519042969	12.807861328125	439.3991394042969	18
perception among EU-8 is that they see themselves as peripheral to their	85.07998657226562	348.8898010253906	12.0	439.3680114746094	18

Now the Mid-term Evaluation of the Financial Perspective 2007-2013 is on top of	85.08000183105469	390.2898254394531	12.017730712890625	439.38002014160156	19

Therefore, the capacity for a clever and early positioning in these contexts has a	85.0799560546875	459.289794921875	12.0	439.36798095703125	19

constellations, in which actors of this Brussels scene were - although regarded as	85.07998657226562	555.8896484375	12.0	439.2900085449219	20
a peripheral group - able through formal and informal exchange of knowledge to	85.07998657226562	569.689697265625	12.0	439.3031311035156	20

This means that the 12 new Member States are dealt with in “stability and convergence	85.0797119140625	701.396240234375	10.020004272460938	439.37908935546875	21

sector potential: This means that cohesion policy involves environmental aspects,	85.08001708984375	86.74981689453125	12.0	439.384765625	23
enlargement and energy policy as well as the second pillar of CAP, the rural	85.08001708984375	100.5498046875	12.0	439.3812255859375	23

Factors influencing the actual arena of negotiations are, firstly, whether	85.08000183105469	141.9498291015625	12.0	439.29237365722656	24
participants are - at a societal-cultural level - able to react in an adequate manner.	85.08000183105469	155.74981689453125	12.0	439.2766876220703	24
This personal disposition is based on working experience and the study	85.08000183105469	169.5498046875	12.0	439.3980255126953	24
background, thus the level of socialisation in an international and European-	85.08000183105469	183.34979248046875	12.0	439.2383575439453	24
oriented context. To what extend does the new generation of staff already	85.08001708984375	197.08978271484375	12.0	439.2803955078125	24
represent modern diplomats for Europe? The second vector of influence is based	85.08001708984375	210.8897705078125	12.0	439.38720703125	24
on the national background and on domestic politics: Which is the room of	85.08004760742188	224.68975830078125	12.0	439.3439636230469	24
manoeuvre for participants to act as promoter or transmitter? In other words, when	85.08004760742188	238.48974609375	12.0	439.4303894042969	24
it comes to the contextualisation of actors’ behaviour the level of independence is	85.08004760742188	252.28973388671875	12.0	439.2815856933594	24
important: To which degree are persons involved able to speak in the name of the	85.08004760742188	266.0897216796875	12.0	439.2996520996094	24
EU-Institution and thus to transmit the philosophy of the relevant EU institution6?	85.08004760742188	277.408203125	14.48162841796875	439.3319396972656	24
To what extent does a general consensus among elites (and the public) exist that	85.07998657226562	293.6898193359375	12.0	439.2516174316406	24
EU membership is beneficial in the long run? To combine the factors: What kind of	85.07998657226562	307.48980712890625	12.0	439.2623596191406	24
coalitions are actors of the Brussels scene willing (personally) and able (externally	85.07998657226562	321.289794921875	12.0	439.3056335449219	24
dominated or influenced) to form? These questions are coupled with the	85.07998657226562	335.08978271484375	12.0	439.3559875488281	24
necessary acceptance of the open-endedness of decision-making and the fact that	85.08000183105469	348.8897705078125	12.0	439.2936553955078	24
benefits are long-termed and somewhat abstract (Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004).	85.08000183105469	362.68975830078125	12.0	405.4355926513672	24
The expected outcome is the application of refined negotiation capacities which	85.08000183105469	390.2898254394531	12.0	439.3463897705078	25
include an openness for mutual dialogue and the ability to create incentives for a	85.07998657226562	404.0898132324219	12.0	439.3799743652344	25
consensual behaviour (in order to form coalitions), while being flexible and	85.07998657226562	417.8898010253906	12.0	439.3163757324219	25
dynamic. Thus a feeling for different, soft steering methods is needed, while	85.07998657226562	431.6897888183594	12.0	439.3320617675781	25

argue out of the philosophy of the relevant EU institution is needed and part of the	85.08001708984375	459.2897644042969	12.0	439.33203125	25
game. In the context of transferring normative aspects, the capacity of actors to	85.08001708984375	473.0897521972656	12.0	439.3824462890625	25
easily intertwin policy fields and topics in a clever way is requested. In the field of	85.08001708984375	486.8897399902344	12.0	439.3079833984375	25

Strategy is necessary. By using soft diplomacy, the EU personnel is able to multi-	85.08004760742188	514.48974609375	12.0177001953125	439.2503967285156	25
varietly adopt to the situation, to grasp the opportunities and finally to carve out	85.08004760742188	528.2896728515625	12.0	439.3056335449219	25
creative niches. Thereby, an increasingly European-oriented motivation of	85.08004760742188	542.0897216796875	12.0	439.3163757324219	25

Discussions in political science and sociology focus the consolidation phase of the	85.08000183105469	624.8898315429688	12.0	439.3883819580078	27

addition, multi-level governance is the new game in town, which entails formal and	85.07994079589844	680.08984375	12.0177001953125	439.32118225097656	27

Sociological approaches refer to the notion of “tacit knowledge”, which goes back	85.08000183105469	114.34979248046875	12.0	439.39442443847656	31
to the work of Polanyi (1985): a “canon of knowledge” is forming an integral part of	85.08001708984375	128.1497802734375	12.0	439.3787841796875	31
the individual and social life. This canon not only entails explicit forms of	85.08001708984375	141.94976806640625	12.0	439.35113525390625	31

lifestyle (Marks et al 2006: 157). In other words this implies norms and rules set by	85.07998657226562	335.08978271484375	12.0	439.3320007324219	47

making. In this logic e.g. the European Parliament is the embodiment of issues	85.07997131347656	417.88970947265625	12.017730712890625	439.36314392089844	47

as social and territorial cohesion, which is now even codified in the Treaty of	85.07992553710938	445.48968505859375	12.017730712890625	439.3547668457031	47

Given the political and economic transnationalization, which European integration	85.08000183105469	486.8898010253906	12.0	439.3656768798828	48
implies, it has to be reflected that the state is still a central agent and a centre	85.08000183105469	500.6898193359375	12.0	439.2887725830078	48

understand the domestic context of party competition in order to gain a full picture	85.08001708984375	542.0897216796875	12.0	439.3367919921875	48
of the context for national elite positions on European integration	85.08003234863281	555.8897705078125	12.0	439.2479705810547	48
(Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004: 17f.). In other words, parties can be considered as	85.08001708984375	569.689697265625	12.0	439.25518798828125	48
gatekeepers for European interaction: European argumentation is closely related	85.08001708984375	583.48974609375	12.0	439.33197021484375	48
to positions in their party systems (Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004: 2). Consequently,	85.08001708984375	597.2897338867188	12.0	439.4075927734375	48
actors of the Brussels scene are through direct or indirect party affinity embedded	85.08001708984375	611.0897216796875	12.0	439.3800048828125	48
in different frames of political thinking, which implies understandings of a certain	85.08001708984375	624.8897705078125	12.0	439.33917236328125	48

a given society (Langenohl/Westphal 2007: 8). Actors have thus to adequately	85.07998657226562	652.48974609375	12.0	439.2696228027344	48
articulate political-societal projects to react to developments such as fragmenting,	85.08001708984375	666.289794921875	12.0	439.37640380859375	48

mentioned. While from from 2004 onwards, e.g. the latter has been (Vice-) Chairman of the	85.07708740234375	726.65234375	10.019996643066406	439.3399658203125	49
Committee for External Affairs, he used to be Minister for European Affairs 1991-1996 and 2000-	85.07710266113281	738.1753540039062	10.019996643066406	439.4431610107422	49
2001 and Counceller for the Prime Minister for questions relating to European Integration. In	85.07710266113281	749.6983642578125	10.019996643066406	439.44712829589844	49
addition, he was Vice-Director of the European-oriented University of Natolin, Poland.	85.07710266113281	761.1612548828125	10.019996643066406	377.3622283935547	49

disintegrative and exclusionary dynamics within societies. It is a discernible pattern	85.08000183105469	72.9498291015625	12.0	439.42323303222656	51
that it is easier for actors of oppositional parties to support pro-European views	85.08000183105469	86.74981689453125	12.0	439.30799865722656	51
and of having an increased interest to demonstrate leadership	85.07998657226562	100.5498046875	12.0	439.3631896972656	51
(Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004). The capacity for strategic thinking and the addressee-	85.07998657226562	114.34979248046875	12.0	439.2768249511719	51
orientation among politicians and administrative staff of the Brussels scene also	85.07998657226562	128.1497802734375	12.0	439.3716125488281	51
depends on the frequency of governmental changes: Political changes might be	85.07998657226562	141.94976806640625	12.0	439.3752136230469	51
coupled with a shuffling of personnel and thematic reorientations as well as with	85.07998657226562	155.749755859375	12.0	439.3259582519531	51

As to the second factor it can be stated that Polish political activists for regional	85.08000183105469	197.08984375	12.0	439.3488311767578	52
policy of the Brussels scene are predominately pro-market libertarian oriented.	85.08001708984375	210.88983154296875	12.0	439.286376953125	52
This means that their party affiliation allows them - as concerns EU issues - to	85.08001708984375	224.6898193359375	12.0	439.4088134765625	52
support so-called new politics dimensions such as environment and participatory	85.08001708984375	238.48980712890625	12.0	439.29718017578125	52
decision-making (Henderson 2001: 10 in Marks et al 2006: 168). While parties	85.08001708984375	252.289794921875	12.0	439.40875244140625	52

parliamentary elections of 2005 e.g. MEPs belonging to the PO were still in a	85.08003234863281	279.8897705078125	12.01776123046875	439.30796813964844	52
position to argue more quality than quantity-oriented, together with a view on side-	85.08001708984375	293.68975830078125	12.0	439.3079833984375	52
policy fields: Given that opposition party members were nationally not directly	85.08004760742188	307.48974609375	12.0	439.2528381347656	52
responsible for the negotiation outcomes of the Councils of Ministers, they have	85.08004760742188	321.28973388671875	12.017730712890625	439.3919982910156	52
had the freedom to think in different categories and to carve out creative niches	85.080078125	335.0897216796875	12.0	439.2587890625	52
while articulating political-societal projects. In this logic they could use the moral	85.08009338378906	348.88970947265625	12.0	439.33799743652344	52
embeddedness and integrational power of the relevant EU institution (and the	85.080078125	362.689697265625	12.0	439.362060546875	52
party family) for their transnational argumentation, while demonstrating an	85.080078125	376.48968505859375	12.0	439.3067626953125	52
openness for different regulatory ideas and an abandoning of nationally embedded	85.08006286621094	390.2896728515625	12.0	439.33314514160156	52
practices of norm- and rule-setting. This tendency is supported by the Polish	85.08004760742188	404.08966064453125	12.0	439.2912292480469	52
personnel of EU institutions such as the European Commission and the Council of	85.08004760742188	417.8896484375	12.017730712890625	439.2743835449219	52
Ministers, which has been selected through big parties already in 2004.	85.08004760742188	431.68963623046875	12.017730712890625	377.55718994140625	52
The negotiation potential of actors of the New Member States	85.08000183105469	459.67510986328125	12.0	349.3679962158203	53
In the empirical part three examples are highlighted to illuminate the power of the	85.08000183105469	486.8898010253906	12.0	439.35597229003906	54
alleged peripheral group of EU-8. That means that the management of structural	85.07998657226562	500.6898193359375	12.0	439.4016418457031	54
mismatches might be beneficial for the so called outsiders. This inferior position	85.07998657226562	514.48974609375	12.0	439.3835754394531	54
enables actors of this inner circle vis-à-vis their negotiation partners to	85.07998657226562	528.289794921875	12.0177001953125	371.6112365722656	54
- be taken as an example because they have an openness for new thematic	103.08000183105469	542.08984375	12.0	412.98121643066406	54
fields (e.g. eco-tourism in the field of agriculture);	121.08000183105469	555.8897705078125	12.0	259.47837829589844	54
- introduce or suggest new and creative ways of thinking;	103.08000183105469	569.6898193359375	12.0	312.8136749267578	54
- have the “right” to act in a contra-factual way, which might at first sight	103.08000183105469	583.4898071289062	12.000015258789062	389.4719696044922	54
suggest a naïve way of behaving.	121.07998657226562	597.289794921875	12.0	178.20477294921875	54
Due to the similar authoritarian legacy, the commonly shared accession process,	85.08000183105469	624.8898315429688	12.0	439.23719787597656	55
thus the experience of “Europeanization from scratch” there is less diversity and	85.08001708984375	638.6898193359375	12.0	439.3380126953125	55
more bunching among the EU-8. Seen from the socio-economic angle, the group	85.08004760742188	652.4898681640625	12.0	439.3523864746094	55
of EU-8 formed net recipients with high expectations as to the volume and the	85.08003234863281	666.2898559570312	12.0	439.3679656982422	55
intensity of structural funds and CAP allowances. Within this new embeddedness,	85.08004760742188	680.08984375	12.0	439.2359924316406	55
some communities or clusters might again take the leadership: This might be true	85.08004760742188	693.8898315429688	12.0	439.4039611816406	55
for the Polish delegation due to the size of the delegation and the respective	85.08004760742188	707.6898193359375	12.0	439.2828063964844	55
11 In contrast to possible changes in the national context, which might happen at a quicker pace,	85.08000183105469	736.2136840820312	11.912635803222656	439.2719268798828	56

Based on the advantage of a small number of interlocuters, already in 2004,	85.08000183105469	114.34979248046875	12.0	439.3704376220703	59

States in Brussels were formed. To compensate for uncertainties regular, weekly	85.08001708984375	141.94976806640625	12.01776123046875	439.3536376953125	59
meetings and exchanges of additional information were organized on the basis of	85.08001708984375	155.749755859375	12.0	439.30078125	59
the EU-8.	85.08001708984375	169.54974365234375	12.0	50.714385986328125	59
To gain an insight into the potential of the EU-8, three examples are highlighted in	85.08000183105469	197.08984375	12.0	439.3056182861328	60
the following. These small case studies are based on increasingly popular themes.	85.08001708984375	210.88983154296875	12.0	437.61004638671875	60
New legal instrument: European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation (EGTC)	85.08000183105469	238.48980712890625	12.01776123046875	408.1044158935547	61
The main input for the introduction of this framework legal instrument and thus the	85.08000183105469	266.08984375	12.0	439.37879943847656	62
upgrade of the goal of territorial cohesion stems from the European Parliament in	85.08001708984375	279.88983154296875	12.01776123046875	439.39801025390625	62
close cooperation with the DG Regio of the European Commission. The underlying	85.08001708984375	293.6898193359375	12.01776123046875	439.3775634765625	62
assumption, which reflects the philosophy of the European Parliament, is to	85.08001708984375	307.48980712890625	12.0	439.36322021484375	62
incorporate the territorial dimension into Community policies, given the real impact	85.08001708984375	321.289794921875	12.0	439.3427734375	62
of sectoral policies – such as transport, environment, competition and research	85.08001708984375	335.08978271484375	12.0	439.3896484375	62
policy – on the territory of the European Union. The initial draft, which included a	85.08001708984375	348.8897705078125	12.0	439.39801025390625	62

transnational dimensions was strongly supported by the Polish rapporteur,	85.08001708984375	376.48974609375	12.0	439.2816162109375	62
nominated by the Committee on Regional Development in the EP, Mr Jan Olbrycht	85.08001708984375	390.28973388671875	12.017730712890625	439.41839599609375	62
(PO). The former president of Upper Silesia is a strong advocate for a far-reaching	85.08001708984375	404.0897216796875	12.017730712890625	439.37158203125	62
regionalization. It is remarkable that - in the context of EU cohesion policy - he was	85.08001708984375	417.88970947265625	12.0	439.4495849609375	62
the only politician out of MEPs of the EU-8 to be nominated as rapporteur for a	85.08001708984375	431.689697265625	12.0	439.39202880859375	62
draft regulation under the procedure of co-decision. Moreover, as a member of the	85.08001708984375	445.48968505859375	12.0	439.43157958984375	62
European People’s Party he has the standing and the openness to bargain with	85.08001708984375	459.2896728515625	12.017730712890625	439.30316162109375	62
other national delegations and to closely co-operate with other EU-institutions. In	85.08001708984375	473.08966064453125	12.0	439.35833740234375	62
this context, he could benefit from close and long-lasting personal contacts with	85.08000183105469	486.8896484375	12.0	439.3260040283203	62
the Commissioner Mrs Danuta Hübner and with the Committee of the Regions	85.08001708984375	500.68963623046875	12.01776123046875	439.35125732421875	62

the first time: This indirect instrumentalization of the CoR throws new lines into the	85.07997131347656	583.48974609375	12.017745971679688	439.31993103027344	62

due to its relatively cost-free stance. When it comes to the application, regionally	85.08000183105469	652.4898681640625	12.0	439.2864532470703	63

means that although the Polish delegation was said to play the nationalistic card	85.08001708984375	114.34979248046875	12.0	439.3524169921875	66
(as to the Reform Treaty), the enthusiastic advocacy for the introduction of the	85.08001708984375	128.1497802734375	12.01776123046875	439.38482666015625	66

The second example scrutinizes the policy-making process for the introduction of	85.08000183105469	252.289794921875	12.0	439.3379669189453	69
a new theme within the financially most important goal convergence. With regard	85.07998657226562	266.08978271484375	12.01776123046875	439.3728332519531	69
to policy framing the stress on the theme of housing underlines the importance of	85.08001708984375	279.8897705078125	12.01776123046875	439.25042724609375	69
the urban dimension and could be interpreted as a contribution to discussions of	85.08004760742188	293.68975830078125	12.0	439.3295593261719	69

Based on the family of nation’s argument the introduction of this theme has been	85.08000183105469	362.6898193359375	12.0	439.3463897705078	70
promoted by representatives of former Visegrád countries13: Based on shared	85.08000183105469	374.00823974609375	14.499298095703125	439.3692169189453	70

be exclusively new Member States. The final introduction of this policy strand in	85.07998657226562	404.08978271484375	12.0	439.3487854003906	70
the General Provision of EU cohesion policy in mid-2006 was remarkable, since	85.07998657226562	417.8897705078125	12.017730712890625	439.3318786621094	70
the financing of housing aspects happens for the first time ever. In general, it	85.07998657226562	431.68975830078125	12.0	439.2768859863281	70
follows the actual European-wide tendency that the urban dimension is	85.07998657226562	445.48974609375	12.0	439.3103942871094	70
strengthened by a separate Communication of the European Commission in	85.07998657226562	459.28973388671875	12.017730712890625	439.3199768066406	70

important during the last years, reflected in the agenda of the Summit of G-8. In	85.0799560546875	486.88970947265625	12.017730712890625	439.32000732421875	70
sum, the group of EU-8 has proved to be forerunners and has carved out a	85.0799560546875	500.689697265625	12.0	439.38836669921875	70

introduction and the application of new financial instruments such as Jaspers,	85.07998657226562	693.8898315429688	12.0177001953125	439.3559875488281	73

studies it has become clear that there exists a potential for successful	85.08001708984375	693.8898315429688	12.0	439.33319091796875	81
negotiations, which yielded surprising results on the policy, politics and even polity	85.08000183105469	707.6898193359375	12.0	439.30079650878906	81
14 Mr Janowski was a mayor of Rrzeszów and a former Senator to represent Torún. Since the	85.08000183105469	736.2136840820312	11.927467346191406	439.36805725097656	82

level. Actors of the group of EU-8 could successfully use their outsider status and	85.08000183105469	72.9498291015625	12.0	439.4015655517578	84
the semi-optimal integration as an instrument to reinforce their negotiation	85.08000183105469	86.74981689453125	12.0	439.3848419189453	84
possibilities. The newcomers were thus able to positively “play the card of	85.08000183105469	100.5498046875	12.0	439.3488311767578	84

It remains an open question whether participants now better know how to cope	85.08000183105469	141.9498291015625	12.0	439.38233947753906	85

negotiations in the concert of now 27 Member States, while being alert to the	85.07998657226562	169.5498046875	12.0	439.3631896972656	85
Reform Treaty as a future basis of conduct. Are actors of the EU-8 now fully	85.07998657226562	183.34979248046875	12.01776123046875	439.2950134277344	85

addition, it remains to be seen, whether regional formations or clusterings such as	85.08001708984375	210.8897705078125	12.0	439.33074951171875	85
the Visegrád Group will pertain as new inner circles, based on smooth cooperation	85.08001708984375	224.68975830078125	12.01776123046875	439.31640625	85

In a medium term perspective actors of the EU-8, which are socialized and	85.08000183105469	266.08984375	12.0	439.3606719970703	86
embedded in the internal structures, might increasingly be able to argue out of the	85.08000183105469	279.88983154296875	12.0	439.3560333251953	86
