In the field of educational research, the dominant discourse is squarely focused	144.6999969482422	590.8796997070312	11.0	386.72718811035156	20
on the practices of humans such as teachers and students (SØRENSON, 2007).	144.6999969482422	605.0797119140625	11.0	392.84327697753906	20
This makes a great deal of sense since education is primarily concerned with	144.6999969482422	619.1796875	11.0	375.37501525878906	20
human learning. In some cases, however, this focus on human practices may	144.6999969482422	633.3796997070312	11.0	377.4871368408203	20
mask the roles that materials play and furthermore limit the richness of	144.6999969482422	647.479736328125	11.0	343.8490447998047	20
understanding concerning learning situations (SHAFFER & CLINTON, 2006). In	144.6999969482422	661.6796875	11.0	388.9379425048828	20
mathematics education, for example, some researchers have gone as far as to	144.6999969482422	675.7797241210938	11.0	384.53810119628906	20
suggest that the intrinsic characteristics of educational technologies cease to	144.6999969482422	689.979736328125	11.0	374.6161651611328	20
mediate learning and become increasingly transparent as learners' incorporate	144.6999969482422	704.0797119140625	11.0	383.51515197753906	20
them in their mathematical activities (MEIRA, 1998). Such approaches privilege	144.6999969482422	718.2797241210938	11.000007629394531	386.5070343017578	20
the role of humans to the point of obscuring important aspects of the meditational	144.6999969482422	732.3796997070312	11.0	396.50636291503906	20

activity theory. Originating with the ideas of VYGOTSKY (1986 [1934]) and	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	363.78099060058594	41
LEONT'EV (1978), activity theory is a psychological approach that is particularly	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	389.27919006347656	41

that are mediated by cultural tools. These tools can be both internal or	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	341.86912536621094	44

of activity, activity theory refers to systems of human activity mediated by tools	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	381.89820861816406	45
whereas ANT speaks to networks of humans and non-humans all mediating each	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	397.02333068847656	45
other's activity. From an ANT perspective, the properties of technologies in	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	364.1660614013672	45
learning situations cannot be ignored or considered transparent since both they	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	386.63917541503906	45
and the humans that use them mediate each other (LATOUR, 2007; LAW, 2002;	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	393.47023010253906	45
SHAFFER & CLINTON, 2006). Instead, ANT focuses on the ways in which socio-	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	396.4512481689453	45
technical networks form as humans and non-humans interact and their practices	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	391.5012969970703	45
stabilize (LATOUR, 2007). These networks are composed of relations of network-	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	397.6392364501953	45
objects themselves enacted by nested networks of humans and non-humans	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	374.8692169189453	45
(LAW, 2002; LAW & MOL, 2001). In the case of this study, for example, TI-Nspire	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	398.9152374267578	45
is treated as both a material object and a network-object. As a network-object it is	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	397.5291290283203	45
an element of classroom socio-technical networks that is enacted through nested	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	395.34022521972656	45
networks that include its developers, the teachers and students who use it,	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	363.66014099121094	45
electronics, software, and mathematical knowledge. Network-objects such as TI-	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	392.89808654785156	45
Nspire become what LATOUR (1990) refers to as "immutable" as the networks	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	383.90003967285156	45
that form them become stable. While network-objects stabilize in the context of	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	384.70301818847656	45
patterns of relations, the networks themselves remain fluid (LATOUR, 1990). In	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	386.3200225830078	45
this fluid space, the relations between network-objects constantly adapt as new	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	385.88026428222656	45
elements emerge or existing elements reconfigure but throughout this fluidity,	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	376.9700469970703	45
there is by necessity continuity. Otherwise, networks cease to remain intact, "If	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	382.8660430908203	45
everything is taken apart at the same time the result is rupture, the loss of shape-	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	396.23121643066406	45
continuity, the loss of identity. The result is more likely to be the creation of an	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	379.44508361816406	45
alternative object" (LAW, 2002, p.99). In these cases, network-objects become	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	383.9221954345703	45
new entities such as a phonebook being repurposed as a doorstop or a bolt	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	368.11524963378906	45
dissolving into the car it holds together. Drawing on ANT conceptions of socio-	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	381.5460968017578	45

understanding of cognition as tool mediated activity, in this study I examine	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	365.4199981689453	45
classrooms using TI-Nspire. This examination is at a scale in which the	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	345.76292419433594	45
technology is viewed as a network-object while recognizing that it and other	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	367.62001037597656	45

To develop an understanding of the ways TI-Nspire is used in classrooms, I	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	368.1039581298828	49
observed and interviewed two teachers who regularly include the technology as	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	386.7490997314453	49
part of their instructional practices. These teachers were chosen because they	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	381.79920959472656	49
are both fluent users of the technology who make extensive use of it in their	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	369.05006408691406	49
classrooms but have distinct teaching and technology use backgrounds. One	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	375.5841827392578	49
teacher is an experienced mathematics educator who has worked with graphing	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	389.11415100097656	49
calculators for more than ten years while, at the time of the study, the other	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	366.0801239013672	49
teacher was new to teaching mathematics but had a background in computer	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	376.18922424316406	49
programming and teaching technology. Choosing teachers with a high level of	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	379.7970733642578	49
technical literacy afforded me access to contexts where the technology was	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	367.79615783691406	49
embedded in many mathematics education practices but, by the same token,	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	375.4632110595703	49
such levels of technical fluency are likely not present in most classrooms and this	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	395.56019592285156	49
limits my view of the ways TI-Nspire is used. [12]	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	237.8470001220703	49
First, I conducted audio-recorded interviews using a semi-structured schedule	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	378.7960968017578	50
that focused on the teachers' use of TI-Nspire and their experiences with	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	354.4750518798828	50
technology in the classroom. I drew on the work of MISHLER (1986, 2004) and	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	384.59315490722656	50
WEISS (1995) to guide the interview process and strove for conversations that	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	383.09718322753906	50
were informal and flexible in nature. Following these initial interviews, I observed	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	391.14906311035156	50
a series of five sessions in a ninth grade class taught by each teacher. During the	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	397.3863067626953	50
five sessions in each class, I followed a complete teaching unit. In one class the	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	389.0150909423828	50
unit involved the teaching of the algebraic skills necessary to perform operations	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	391.4131622314453	50
such as simplification on binomial expressions. In the other class, the unit	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	358.17112731933594	50
focused on working with data to produce graphs and functions to model trends. I	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	391.8863067626953	50
chose to follow a complete teaching unit in each class so that I would have the	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	382.03016662597656	50
opportunity to observe both when TI-Nspire was used as well as when it wasn't. I	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	393.3710479736328	50
chose ninth grade classes because in this particular school, this was the grade	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	383.31715393066406	50
level at which students either purchased or were given a TI-Nspire handheld to	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	383.6031036376953	50
use rather than only having access to the technology during class time. This	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	370.7000274658203	50
situation offered me the interesting opportunity of observing students who were	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	385.3521270751953	50
relatively new to the technology and yet had unfettered access for developing	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	376.95924377441406	50
fluency with it. [13]	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	90.74699401855469	50
While observing the classes, I recorded the activity with a video camera from the	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	392.89808654785156	51
back corner of the classrooms. In general, I followed the teachers with the	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	360.62403869628906	51
camera since my intention for the classroom observations was to concentrate on	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	392.56825256347656	51
the ways they included TI-Nspire in their instructional practices and situated the	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	386.68312072753906	51
technology for their students. This focus on the teachers guided the majority of	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	383.51527404785156	51
the in-camera editing decisions made about where to focus recording but I also	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	385.5061798095703	51
made efforts to maintain a wide view as much as possible using panning and	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	374.70399475097656	51
zooming sparingly. As DERRY et al. suggest, while a certain amount of pan and	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	390.1701202392578	51
zoom may be needed to get a detailed view of activities of interest, "too much	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	377.6190948486328	51
selection at recording time may rule out later lines of analysis" (2010, p.48).	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	367.7080841064453	51

as a whole. Following each observed session, I invited the teachers to participate	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	395.0211944580078	54

interaction analysis (JORDAN & HENDERSON, 1995). This approach shares	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	376.0348663330078	56
many of the same or similar theoretical assumptions that are to be found in this	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	385.71522521972656	56
study. In particular, the approach assumes "that knowledge and action are	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	362.45018005371094	56
fundamentally social in origin, organization, and use, and are situated in particular	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	398.48622131347656	56
social and material ecologies" (p.41). This basic assumption is shared by both	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	379.88514709472656	56

correct answer at the back of a textbook can provide in isolation. It can act more	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	390.5662384033203	79
as a guide than as a simple arbiter of correct answers. Reflecting this advantage,	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	395.4062042236328	79
both teachers encouraged their students to work with the technology and their	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	379.8632354736328	79

about mathematical concepts and procedures. Speaking about the benefits of	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	378.90626525878906	79
this practice during an interview, one teacher explained:	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	271.8650360107422	79
"I think the TI-Nspire allows them to play around with partial understandings much	167.39999389648438	391.93609619140625	10.0	359.1297302246094	80
more comfortably than the textbook. You need to fit yourself into the correct ways that	167.39999389648438	406.0361022949219	10.0	375.9896545410156	80
the textbook proposes you do things and some kids just can't find it in themselves to	167.39999389648438	420.236083984375	10.0	369.7496643066406	80
do that. So they can still be incorrect and playing around with their ideas and trying to	167.39999389648438	434.3360900878906	10.0	372.5397644042969	80
resolve them with the TI-Nspire with feedback all the time. The only feedback you get	167.39999389648438	448.5361022949219	10.0	373.9597473144531	80

This teacher notes that like the back of the textbook TI-Nspire can be used to	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	376.93714904785156	81
check if an answer is correct. He asserts that unlike the back of the textbook,	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	375.5951690673828	81
however, TI-Nspire is more flexible giving students more latitude to explore	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	364.65000915527344	81
mathematical ideas. The teacher suggests that when students are working on	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	378.87318420410156	81
questions from their textbook, the technology becomes a partner in the activity.	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	384.9231719970703	81
Similar to the relationship between teacher, student and TI-Nspire in terms of	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	375.48512268066406	81

We have just seen how new patterns of relations were formed with TI-Nspire as a	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	397.30909729003906	83
locus of mathematical authority in the classrooms. Now we will look at the ways in	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	398.12306213378906	83
which the mathematical tasks that were assigned to students were adapted.	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	369.7432403564453	83
Speaking to such changing practices, teacher one noted that by affording	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.01617431640625	357.7350616455078	83
students a more flexible way to work through problems, TI-Nspire had changed	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	385.2311553955078	83
the types of questions he felt comfortable assigning. Talking specifically about	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	380.32496643066406	83

Similarly, the technology also changed the way the other teacher gave	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	342.56211853027344	87
assignments. Instead of handing out a paper worksheet or assigning questions	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	384.63722229003906	87

These digital documents contained pages such as those presented in Figure 3.	144.6999969482422	389.97967529296875	11.0	385.4842071533203	89

questions, calculation, tables, graphing, and space for recording answers. Once	144.6999969482422	418.2796936035156	11.0	389.36720275878906	89

collect their work so that he could examine it on his own TI-Nspire or using a	144.6999969482422	446.5796813964844	11.0	372.34999084472656	89
computer based version of the technology. During an interview, the teacher	144.6999969482422	460.6796875	11.0	366.69606018066406	89
expressed a preference for this approach over the more traditional worksheet or	144.6999969482422	474.87969970703125	11.0	389.7852325439453	89

While here the teacher focuses on pragmatic reasons for assigning digital	144.6999969482422	588.0797119140625	11.0	359.92005920410156	91

based on year of birth, the teacher spoke about how he had approached the	144.6999969482422	658.7797241210938	11.0	371.5142364501953	91

"What I've done before is I would have given them an instruction sheet. It's a double-	167.39999389648438	702.0361328125	10.0	371.6495666503906	92
sided sheet of paper. There's a graph of the men's data so they didn't actually plot the	167.39999389648438	716.1361083984375	10.0	376.1797180175781	92

was to have students explore the concept of modeling trends in data through	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	373.72523498535156	96
lines of best fit, he did not see the approach as ideal. Graphing the data on paper	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	396.2643585205078	96
took a long time but allowed students to interpret and draw their own lines of best	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	395.7032012939453	96
fit while using the older calculators for graphing took less time but did not afford	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	387.1891632080078	96
students the chance to create their own lines of best fit. TI-Nspire, however,	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	368.89601135253906	96
allows much of the manual work of data entry to be eliminated while still providing	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	397.03419494628906	96
students the opportunity to create their own graphs and lines of best fit using its	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	387.64015197753906	96
graphical functionality. By providing students with a digital document containing	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	385.94618225097656	96
all the necessary data and instructions, the teacher was able to make what he	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	379.7201690673828	96
considered to be much better use of the available class time while still focusing	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	384.36195373535156	96
the activity on the interpretation of data. Particularly by reducing the time required	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	396.84718322753906	96
for students to perform tasks, the relationship between student and TI-Nspire	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	375.49610900878906	96
opens up new instructional possibilities that allow teachers and learners to focus	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	390.84120178222656	96
on mathematical concepts. In response to these possibilities, new patterns of	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	375.47413635253906	96
relations were found in the two classrooms between such network-objects as the	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	393.06312561035156	96
textbook and TI-Nspire that showed ways that the classroom socio-technical	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	371.47010803222656	96
networks adapted in terms of locations of mathematical tasks. [31]	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	323.54701232910156	96

While TI-Nspire may open up new instructional possibilities and ways of working,	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	393.38209533691406	98
it was not the only location of mathematical activity observed in the classrooms. It	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	396.6050567626953	98
was not even the only digital technology used. In the school that this study was	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	384.13124084472656	98
conducted, the teachers had dynamic geometry software such as The	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0162353515625	340.7200164794922	98
Geometers Sketchpad™, and statistical and graphing software such as Fathom™	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0162353515625	399.3000030517578	98
and Tinkerplots™ at their disposal. As is the case in many schools, however, this	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.01617431640625	394.7521514892578	98
software was hosted on computers in a lab that required classes to change	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	365.7061309814453	98
classrooms. By contrast, TI-Nspire is a mobile handheld device that can be used	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	392.52418518066406	98
in any classroom but has drawbacks particularly in terms of the limited size of its	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	391.3361358642578	98
screen and keyboard. These factors meant that the teacher participants had to	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	383.4932403564453	98
choose when to use TI-Nspire and when to use the computer lab. Discussing this	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	395.7801055908203	98
relationship, one teacher talked about how TI-Nspire relates to the computer lab:	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	392.7222442626953	98
"It's nice that there's a single tool that the kids can use for pretty much all the math	167.39999389648438	759.8360595703125	10.0	361.5695495605469	99
that we're doing right now. So if I can't get into the computer lab we can still do	167.39999389648438	773.9360961914062	10.0	344.1794738769531	99

the kids into a different location is really nice. So that this fits itself to the lesson rather	167.39999389648438	151.33612060546875	10.0	376.0497131347656	102
than the lesson having to fit itself to the technology" (teacher one). [32]	167.39999389648438	165.53607177734375	10.01470947265625	309.9700012207031	102
Because TI-Nspire is a handheld technology it is inherently more flexible than a	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	386.1991729736328	103
fixed computer lab in terms of where and when it can be used. As the teacher	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	377.9491729736328	103
notes, it does not necessarily need to be booked and unlike computer labs which	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	393.6791534423828	103
require moving the class to another location can be used for a short part of a	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	373.8131866455078	103
lesson. During the observed classes, both teachers used TI-Nspire at times for	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	383.62513732910156	103
short periods of focused activity that might have been impractical with a computer	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	397.4191436767578	103
lab. For example, guiding the class through the simplification of a polynomial by	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	387.7720489501953	103
writing on the blackboard and describing his actions, one teacher turned to TI-	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	380.75416564941406	103
Nspire during a discussion with two students about what the next operation	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	365.0460968017578	103
should be. The students had different views of how the expression could be	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	368.04908752441406	103
operated upon and the teacher asked them to put it in to the technology saying,	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	387.38722229003906	103
"For those of you with TI-Nspires just try putting that in and hit enter and see what	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	398.5522003173828	103
it gives you back" (teacher one). This kind of quick use of the technology would	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0162353515625	386.05616760253906	103
not be practical if the class had to move to a computer lab. [33]	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	307.3470001220703	103
Beyond having the flexibility of a handheld device that can be easily transported	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	388.2781524658203	104
and used on an ad-hoc basis during a lesson, TI-Nspire was also seen by the	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	377.13502502441406	104
teachers as supporting richer mathematical conversation than traditional	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	351.95603942871094	104
computer labs. One teacher in particular indicated that part of his decision when	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	389.5321807861328	104
choosing TI-Nspire over taking his class to the computer lab was informed by the	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	394.74610900878906	104
idea that it's handheld nature lent itself to supporting or at least not hampering	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	380.4021759033203	104
conversation between students. He notes that, "The computer lab is a hideous	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	381.72218322753906	104
setup where kids are facing the wall around the outside and it's a bad setup for	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	383.90016174316406	104
learning, it's all about computers. The nice thing about [TI-Nspire] is it's not all	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	379.02711486816406	104
about the handhelds" (teacher one). Despite the perceived beneficial attributes of	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0162353515625	395.99623107910156	104
TI-Nspire such as those the teacher refers to, many of its functions such as	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	367.09217834472656	104
dynamic geometry and graphing overlap with features of software often found in	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	390.0271759033203	104
school computer labs. The very size and portability of TI-Nspire that makes it	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	374.2970733642578	104
useful in some situations may render it clumsy and difficult to use in others. The	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	388.74024963378906	104
opinions and practices of the teachers show that a relationship exists between TI-	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	397.3643341064453	104
Nspire and the computer lab. While in many cases TI-Nspire was chosen over the	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	398.9480743408203	104
computer lab, it did not totally replace it and the socio-technical networks in the	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	384.58216857910156	104

in terms of locations of mathematical activity is the interactive whiteboard. It	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	367.9500274658203	105

used. Describing his rationale for the arrangement, the teacher described, "It is	144.6999969482422	592.979736328125	11.0	384.9561309814453	111
so important for them [the students] to be able to have access to it [the interactive	144.6999969482422	607.0797119140625	11.0	398.1232452392578	111
whiteboard] to be able to follow along. It just makes it a lot smoother" (teacher	144.6999969482422	621.2797241210938	11.0	379.7531280517578	111
two). By using an interactive whiteboard in combination with TI-Nspire, the	144.6999969482422	635.3796997070312	11.01617431640625	361.6879425048828	111
teacher demonstrated ways of working and discussed activities that in his class	144.6999969482422	649.5797119140625	11.0	386.18800354003906	111
were almost always assigned as self-contained digital documents. In addition,	144.6999969482422	663.6796875	11.0	378.6970977783203	111
students could and often did come up to the front of the class and share ways	144.6999969482422	677.8796997070312	11.0	378.9281768798828	111
they had approached problems or ways of working with TI-Nspire. For example,	144.6999969482422	691.979736328125	11.0	387.90406799316406	111

whiteboard to show the class how she arrived at a solution to a problem:	144.6999969482422	720.2797241210938	11.000007629394531	352.15403747558594	111

Go head punch it in on my calculator. As [student] punches it in	259.6000061035156	111.736083984375	10.0	277.7196960449219	121
I'm going to describe what she's doing.	259.6000061035156	125.93609619140625	10.0	170.81982421875	121
All right so the very first thing is just to enter the formula and	259.6000061035156	271.83612060546875	10.0	264.0395202636719	122
again it did simplify for us because six divided by three is two.	259.6000061035156	286.03607177734375	10.0	270.1296691894531	122
So the next step [student] did was to divide by two and she's	259.6000061035156	418.43609619140625	10.0	264.6695861816406	123
got 50 is equal to pi times r squared. [37]	259.6000061035156	432.6361083984375	10.0	179.76998901367188	123
Thus, using the TI-Nspire projected on the interactive whiteboard, the student	144.6999969482422	462.97967529296875	11.0	377.3881378173828	124
was able to replicate the work she had done on her handheld. This allowed the	144.6999969482422	477.1796875	11.0	383.6361846923828	124
class to discuss her approach to solving the problem without having to work with	144.6999969482422	491.2796936035156	11.0	390.9840850830078	124
a mediator such as a blackboard that would require them to translate between TI-	144.6999969482422	505.47967529296875	11.0	397.21034240722656	124

A theme that runs through the patterns of relations between TI-Nspire and other	144.6999969482422	547.8796997070312	11.0	389.4992218017578	125

locations of mathematical activity is the crucial connection between the	144.6999969482422	576.1796875	11.000015258789062	345.01499938964844	125
technology and paper/pencil work. The importance of this relationship is also	144.6999969482422	590.3796997070312	11.0	373.52699279785156	125
indicated by the large amount of mathematics education research that focuses	144.6999969482422	604.479736328125	11.0	382.50318908691406	125

2006; KIERAN & SALDANA, 2005; TALL, SMITH & PIEZ, 2008). In the observed	144.6999969482422	646.979736328125	11.0	394.84510803222656	125

digital documents, blackboards, and interactive whiteboards. In the class where	144.6999969482422	703.5797119140625	11.0	386.72718811035156	125
assignments were most often given via paper worksheets and the blackboard	144.6999969482422	717.6796875	11.0	377.31117248535156	125
was the primary medium for sharing with the group, students tended to work	144.6999969482422	731.8796997070312	11.0	371.21705627441406	125
predominately with paper/pencil with TI-Nspire acting as a partner in their	144.6999969482422	745.979736328125	11.0	356.63096618652344	125

TI-Nspire tended to be the focus of student mathematical activity. [39]	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	339.94700622558594	128
Each teacher had distinct impressions of how TI-Nspire and paper/pencil could	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	383.83412170410156	129
be useful as parts of their instructional practices. As is the case with many of the	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	391.8311309814453	129
pedagogical views teachers have, these intentions shaped the role the	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	343.2771453857422	129
technology had in their classrooms (PIERCE, BALL & STACEY, 2009). During	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	381.2488555908203	129

becoming the focus during lessons. Discussing his choice not to find or create	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	380.2370147705078	129
digital documents and distribute them to his students, he explained:	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	328.7130889892578	129
"The documents I haven't used as much as I thought I would. And I don't think its	167.39999389648438	264.53607177734375	10.0	355.1095886230469	130
because there aren't documents out there that are good. It's just that I don't want it to	167.39999389648438	278.736083984375	10.0	372.6595764160156	130
be about the documents, the lessons or the handheld. You know I would prefer it to	167.39999389648438	292.83612060546875	10.0	364.9996032714844	130
be in the background and the kids grab it when they need it" (teacher one). [40]	167.39999389648438	307.03607177734375	10.01470947265625	347.6700134277344	130
This teacher believed strongly that TI-Nspire should be one of many tools	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	357.6980438232422	131
available to students but that most mathematical activity should be on	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	339.0310516357422	131
paper/pencil. Sharing the view of a number of mathematics education	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	338.67909240722656	131
researchers (DRIJVERS, 2000; PIMM, 1995; STACEY, 1997), that handing-off	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	383.28407287597656	131
procedural tasks to technology may actually make conceptualizing mathematical	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	391.75416564941406	131
concepts more difficult, the teacher also expressed concern about TI-Nspire	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	370.19410705566406	131
becoming a black-box. He described his fear of TI-Nspire becoming an opaque	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	385.0880889892578	131
computational machine into which problems go and solutions come out without	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	383.46009826660156	131
any indication of the processes that have been performed. This motivated him to	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	392.30421447753906	131
de-emphasize the importance of the technology in his classroom, instead	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	356.33409118652344	131
choosing to focus mathematical activity on paper/pencil. [41]	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	294.64698791503906	131
The other teacher whose class was observed, had a distinctly different view and	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	389.7411651611328	132
spoke most often about the advantages of TI-Nspire being the primary location of	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	396.3852081298828	132
mathematical activity. Speaking during a debriefing session about a class in	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	369.4240264892578	132
which he had asked students to create a number of graphs so that they could be	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	392.5023956298828	132
compared, he offered:	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	108.20695495605469	132
"I don't think I would have got that discussion necessarily about the different points of	167.39999389648438	590.0361328125	10.0	373.0096740722656	133
intersection for the male and female [datasets] today if I didn't have the technology.	167.39999389648438	604.1361083984375	10.0	364.5595397949219	133
Cause what would have happened is with, I don't know what did we have there 20	167.39999389648438	618.3360595703125	10.0	358.8696594238281	133
data points, some of the kids it would take them half an hour to graph 20 data points.	167.39999389648438	632.4360961914062	10.0	372.1795959472656	133
So by the time they get the one graph created and we get that line drawn that's	167.39999389648438	646.6361083984375	10.0	345.5895080566406	133
almost the entire period right? So you can spend a period let's say creating graphs	167.39999389648438	660.736083984375	10.0	361.5896911621094	133
but now if you want to get through the graphs and just do talking about it and	167.39999389648438	674.9360961914062	10.0	335.85955810546875	133
analysing it and comparing it, it's so much easier to do in an instant have the graph	167.39999389648438	689.0361328125	10.0	363.4795227050781	133

For this teacher, TI-Nspire made it possible to have more discussion and to	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	366.8610076904297	134
address more concepts than would be possible with paper/pencil. He saw these	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	388.2450714111328	134
advantages as outweighing concerns of black-box effects or the technology	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	367.9391632080078	134

being a source of mathematical authority changes the didactic contract between	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	389.6422882080078	145

(PIERCE et al., 2010). While they speak to the changed relationship between	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	376.91517639160156	145

implicated. The textbook in particular, was identified as also acting as a location	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	388.1791534423828	145
of mathematical authority whose relationship with students shifted in relation to	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	383.87806701660156	145

While the textbook was identified as a location of mathematical authority in the	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	382.5471954345703	146
two observed classrooms, it also served as a location of mathematical tasks.	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	373.4170684814453	146
Along with paper worksheets, the blackboard and interactive whiteboard and	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	372.6250762939453	146
digital documents on TI-Nspire, the textbook acted as a way mathematical tasks	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	390.2361602783203	146
were assigned to students. Each of these network-objects afforded the teachers	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	390.17018127441406	146
different possibilities in terms of the kinds of tasks they could assign with the	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	372.3170928955078	146

They assert that when a student undertakes a mathematical task with a computer	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	397.11134338378906	146

technique they use from which mathematical theorizing emerges (DRIJVERS &	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	386.39686584472656	146
KIERAN, 2006; see also KIERAN & SALDANA, 2005). This speaks to the	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	358.08290100097656	146
interrelated nature of materials available to students and the kinds of tasks that	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	385.16517639160156	146
can be assigned. Findings drawn from the two observed classrooms in this study	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	393.8001251220703	146
support DRIJVERS and KIERAN's assertion by suggesting the introduction of TI-	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	394.3280792236328	146
Nspire certainly influences the kinds of tasks assigned to students but, in	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	355.05812072753906	146
addition, suggest that it influences the relationships between teacher, student and	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	398.4533233642578	146
other network elements such as paper worksheets and the blackboard and	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	364.52919006347656	146

interactive whiteboard also acted as a location of mathematical activity in the	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	373.20802307128906	147
classrooms. Together with the computer lab, paper/pencil and TI-Nspire	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	350.40501403808594	147
handhelds, the blackboard and interactive whiteboard served as locations of both	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	395.3952178955078	147
individual and shared mathematical activity. While none of these locations	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	359.9089813232422	147

suggested, in terms of learning perhaps what is most important is that multiple	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	381.4251251220703	150
locations of mathematical activity were available for students to work and share	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	386.1660919189453	150

During the course of this study, I was particularly struck by the relationship	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	362.43907165527344	151
between the activity students engage in individually and activity shared by the	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	377.5861358642578	151
whole class by means of a blackboard or interactive whiteboard. I found that the	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	389.59815979003906	151
materials that participate in this relationship have a distinct role in mediating	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	368.8849639892578	151
mathematical activity and that the interaction between students and materials in	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	388.05824279785156	151
one location had a particular influence on the other and vice versa. In the case of	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0162353515625	394.88917541503906	151
this study, the materials were most often paper and pencil and TI-Nspire for	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	368.3020782470703	151
private activity, and blackboard and interactive whiteboard for public activity. The	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	392.57911682128906	151
complexity of the relationships among these materials, students and teachers as	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	392.09523010253906	151

more focused research with other materials and in other settings would help to	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	382.2281036376953	151
further our understanding of this important aspect of classroom practice. [49]	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	374.14698791503906	151
By taking an ANT approach that required me to attend to the interactions	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	355.05812072753906	152
between humans and non-humans in the classrooms while consciously trying to	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	388.94911193847656	152
limit a priori judgments about their roles and agency and by working with both	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0162353515625	377.24818420410156	152

indicate that socio-technical networks in classrooms using handheld technology	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	387.3651885986328	152
operate as a complex interconnected whole. From interactional analysis of the	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	380.63319396972656	152
video recordings of the two classrooms, it is particularly evident that the effects of	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	396.5391387939453	152
the teachers' decisions to include TI-Nspire as part of their instructional practices	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	393.6460723876953	152
were not limited to, for instance, the local patterns of relations between student	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	384.0762481689453	152

extremely broad, influencing practices as diverse as homework and the use of the	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	398.8052520751953	152
computer lab. The findings of this study show as DRIJVERS et al. (2010)	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	355.2890167236328	152
suggest, that the didactical configuration of technologies in mathematics	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	352.0659942626953	152
classrooms has a profound effect on the mathematical practices within them but	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	389.99415588378906	152
also suggest that this is far from a one-way phenomenon. While teachers have	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	384.1972198486328	152
enormous influence through their choices of what technological arrangements to	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	391.77613830566406	152
use, other agents both human and non-human in the classroom mediate these	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	383.1521759033203	152
configurations and are highly interrelated. For instance, the choice to assign	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	370.1060333251953	152
activities as digital documents rather than as questions from the textbook may	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	380.1382598876953	152
influence the decision to share mathematical activity as a class with an interactive	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	397.58412170410156	152
whiteboard and may influence the decision to create digital notes rather than	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	372.9001007080078	152
work with paper/pencil. Each pattern of socio-technical relations mediates the	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	377.0911407470703	152
others and together they reciprocally shape the geography of the classroom. [50]	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	394.4469757080078	152
