ABSTRACT	70.62399291992188	279.964111328125	11.0400390625	59.891998291015625	6
This article examines the concept of world unity from the time of enlightenment to the present	98.9439926147461	298.32415771484375	11.0400390625	425.22928619384766	7
age. It asserts that the enlightenment conception is responsible for the perversion of human nature	70.62399291992188	310.92413330078125	11.0400390625	453.3576354980469	7
since it elevates human reason over human emotion which has resulted into a narrow understanding of	70.62399291992188	323.6441650390625	11.03997802734375	453.3023986816406	7
the world and the belief that science could guarantee peace. The paper debates the concepts of space	70.62399291992188	336.244140625	11.040008544921875	453.6109924316406	7
and place in relation to westernization as a form of universalism. It shows how universalism is linked	70.62399291992188	348.9641418457031	11.040008544921875	453.5068054199219	7
to space with no respect for diverse cultures according to geographical origins as the case is for	70.62399291992188	361.56414794921875	11.040008544921875	453.6990661621094	7
localism which is rooted in place. It analyses the United States’ pursuit for market unity, a strategy	70.62399291992188	374.16412353515625	11.040008544921875	453.2031555175781	7
which is propagated but with the ill intentions of maintaining her international superiority. The market	70.62399291992188	386.8841247558594	11.040008544921875	453.5881042480469	7
unity project is indeed, an enemy of democracy and a threat to not only cultural diversity, but also to	70.62399291992188	399.504150390625	11.040008544921875	453.2362976074219	7
all life on earth. In this paper I therefore suggest that, contrary to the critics, difference and the	70.62399291992188	412.22412109375	11.040008544921875	453.3465881347656	7
horizontal structure of the Occupy Wall Street movement is advantageous. The fact that people are	70.62399291992188	424.8241271972656	11.040008544921875	453.4172058105469	7
organizing in protests in spite of their diverse cultures is, of course, an act of solidarity and unity. By	70.62399291992188	437.42413330078125	11.040008544921875	453.1809997558594	7
this they demonstrate their belief that a better world is possible and that valuing cultural diversity and	70.62399291992188	450.1441345214844	11.040008544921875	453.6794128417969	7
difference is a prerequisite for coexistence and peace. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is to	70.62399291992188	462.744140625	11.040008544921875	453.3465881347656	7
defend difference and diversity against world unity or totality or sameness.	70.62399291992188	475.4641418457031	11.040008544921875	329.5991516113281	7

1. INTRODUCTION	70.62399291992188	567.721435546875	12.0	110.97599792480469	9
This paper is divided into three main parts. In the first part I will briefly discuss the idea	98.9439926147461	595.0814819335938	12.0	424.88394927978516	10
of unity, from the time of the Enlightenment to the present age. The Enlightenment	70.62399291992188	608.8814697265625	12.0	453.5320129394531	10
conception of unity led to a perversion of human nature that elevated human reason over	70.62399291992188	622.6814575195312	12.0	453.2759704589844	10
human emotion, and eventually led to a narrow understanding of the world, and the belief that	70.62399291992188	636.4814453125	12.0	453.1800231933594	10
science could guarantee peace. Reason, it was believed, would eventually unify all knowledge	70.62399291992188	650.281494140625	12.0	453.4779968261719	10
into absolute truth, which could be spread everywhere on earth.	70.62399291992188	664.0814819335938	12.0	304.7279968261719	10
I will also talk about the concepts of space and place in relation to Westernization a	98.9439926147461	677.8814697265625	12.0	425.42398834228516	10
form of universalism. I hope to show how universalism is connected to space and has no	70.62399291992188	691.6814575195312	12.0	453.5320129394531	10
respect for different cultures, and no longer has any geographical origin, whereas localism is	70.62399291992188	705.50146484375	12.0	453.2760314941406	10
rooted in place. In place-centered worldviews context is of the utmost importance and	70.62399291992188	719.3014526367188	12.0	453.3139953613281	10
difference is respected. Also, the origins are clear and connected to geographical locations.	70.62399291992188	733.1014404296875	12.0	435.4300231933594	10

The second part of this essay consists of a summary and analysis of the United States	98.9439926147461	99.04150390625	12.0	424.93204498291016	14
pursuit for market unity as a way to maintain international superiority. This was used as a	70.62399291992188	112.84149169921875	12.0	453.5439758300781	14
means for keeping peace and containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War. However, we	70.62399291992188	126.6414794921875	12.0	453.6159973144531	14
will see that this project of market unity is, indeed, an enemy of democracy and a threat to,	70.62399291992188	140.44146728515625	12.0	453.1560363769531	14
not only cultural diversity, but also, all life on earth.	70.62399291992188	154.24151611328125	12.0	249.85202026367188	14
In the concluding part of this essay I point to encouraging signs of emerging social	98.9439926147461	168.04150390625	12.0	425.11600494384766	14
movements that are motivated by disdain for the status quo and the unity of the market	70.62399291992188	181.84149169921875	12.0	453.4480285644531	14
system. I suggest, contrary to the critics, that difference and the horizontal structure of the	70.62399291992188	195.6414794921875	12.0	453.5980529785156	14
Occupy Wall Street movement is advantageous. The fact that people are organizing in protest	70.62399291992188	209.44146728515625	12.0	453.5259704589844	14
is, of course, an act of solidarity. One could even describe it as unity. The protesters are	70.62399291992188	223.24151611328125	12.0	453.6759948730469	14
unified only inasmuch as they oppose market unity. They believe that a better world is	70.62399291992188	237.04150390625	12.0	453.2760314941406	14
possible, that alternatives exist, and that valuing cultural diversity and difference is a	70.62399291992188	250.87152099609375	12.0	453.6120300292969	14
prerequisite for coexistence and peace.	70.62399291992188	264.6715087890625	12.0	186.04800415039062	14
Diversity, after all, is a fundamental feature of life, but respect for and acceptance of	98.9439926147461	278.47149658203125	12.0	424.9439468383789	14
diversity by itself is not enough. It merely provides a basis for the negotiation of truths, which	70.62399291992188	292.271484375	12.0	453.5760192871094	14
can end in dynamic hybridity where place and context are respected while being	70.62399291992188	306.07147216796875	12.0	453.4339904785156	14
simultaneously conscious of what is going on in the space arena. Far from advocating for	70.62399291992188	319.87152099609375	11.999969482421875	453.5080261230469	14
isolationism, the main focus of this essay is aimed at defending difference and diversity	70.62399291992188	333.67144775390625	12.0	453.5880432128906	14
against world unity, and what Emmanuel Levinas calls totality or sameness (Morgan, 2007).	70.62399291992188	347.4714660644531	12.0	453.5320129394531	14
Levinas believed that “Western philosophy has been totalizing” because of its preoccupation	70.62399291992188	361.2714538574219	12.0	453.2160339355469	14
in discovering an ultimate Truth believed to unify everything (Morgan, 2007, 95). Hence,	70.62399291992188	375.07147216796875	12.0	453.5520324707031	14
Western philosophy has devalued difference and has resulted in what Levinas refers to as “the	70.62399291992188	388.8714599609375	12.0	453.2519836425781	14
triumph of the Same” (Morgan, 2007, 97).	70.62399291992188	402.69146728515625	12.0	203.4959716796875	14
2. UNIVERSALISM: A WESTERN PROJECT	70.62399291992188	444.3314514160156	12.0	245.989990234375	15
The Western utopian project of the Enlightenment was based on the idea that the	98.9439926147461	471.69146728515625	12.0	424.9560317993164	16
unification of human knowledge and the advancement of science would eventually liberate	70.62399291992188	485.491455078125	12.0	453.4200744628906	16
mankind and ultimately lead to a more peaceful, rational world. All social phenomena and	70.62399291992188	499.2914733886719	12.0	453.5079650878906	16
conflicts in life, it was believed, could be rationally understood, and thereby, solved (Dietrich	70.62399291992188	513.0914306640625	12.0	453.2399597167969	16
and Sutzl, 2006). From this linear perspective, Europe was seen as the epicenter of progress	70.62399291992188	526.8914794921875	12.0	453.2760925292969	16
and civilization.	70.62399291992188	540.6914672851562	12.0	77.35202026367188	16
Human reason became a deity to be worshiped, and in many ways, it took the place of	98.9439926147461	554.521484375	12.0	425.07401275634766	16
Christianity as the central way of interpreting reality. Human emotion, on the other hand, was	70.62399291992188	568.3214721679688	12.0	453.0840148925781	16
relegated as the lower nature and devalued as irrational being associated with nature and	70.62399291992188	582.1214599609375	12.0	453.5080261230469	16
femininity. The Enlightenment quest of attaining universal truth is the foundation of	70.62399291992188	595.9214477539062	12.0	453.5299377441406	16
modernity, which is “characterized by Newtonian physics, Cartesian reductionism, the nation	70.62399291992188	609.721435546875	12.0	453.1680603027344	16
state of Thomas Hobbes, and the capitalist world system” (Dietrich and Sutzl, 2006, 283).	70.62399291992188	623.521484375	12.0	431.54400634765625	16
Wolfgang Sachs, makes a fascinating distinction between space and place in order to	98.9439926147461	637.3214721679688	12.0	425.1879653930664	16
facilitate our understanding of how both universalism and localism function in the world.	70.62399291992188	651.1214599609375	12.0	453.4800109863281	16
Because universalism has “shed all vestiges of its particular origin, place and context, it	70.62399291992188	664.9214477539062	12.0	453.2879333496094	16
belongs nowhere and can therefore penetrate everywhere” (Sachs, 2006, 219). Hence, modern	70.62399291992188	678.721435546875	12.0	453.5319519042969	16
universalism a product of the Enlightenment is a hegemonic project that makes absolute truth	70.62399291992188	692.521484375	12.0	453.4779357910156	16
claims for all cultures of the world and measures civilization in relation to its own narrow	70.62399291992188	706.3414306640625	12.0	453.5679626464844	16
conception of reality.	70.62399291992188	720.1414794921875	12.0	102.19200134277344	16
Localism, however, is rooted in place. In other words, it is connected to cultures	98.9439926147461	733.9414672851562	12.0	425.0380630493164	16
consisting of “particular peoples, memories and cosmologies.” Human experience is	70.62399291992188	747.741455078125	12.0	453.5800476074219	16

connected to specific geographical places. Relationships, too, are intimately related to place.	70.62399291992188	99.04150390625	12.0	453.5760192871094	19
When speaking of place, the context is respected. Furthermore, it is important to point out that	70.62399291992188	112.84149169921875	12.0	453.5500183105469	19
“place is not just the intersection of two lines on a map, but a concentration of meaningful	70.62399291992188	126.6414794921875	12.0	453.3000793457031	19
human activity which gives it a distinct quality, a distinct aura” (Sachs, 2006, 221).	70.62399291992188	140.44146728515625	12.0	399.5059814453125	19
Space-centered universal values have been reinvented and reformulated in various ways	98.9439926147461	154.24151611328125	12.0	425.11405181884766	19
throughout history. The conquistadores and European settlers, for example, sought to spread	70.62399291992188	168.04150390625	12.0	453.5080871582031	19
Christianity often violently throughout the Americas. The Belgian King Leopold II claimed	70.62399291992188	181.84149169921875	12.0	453.4180603027344	19

dramatic signal of the worldwide evaporation of cultures” (Sachs, 2006, 209). Sachs refers to	70.62399291992188	347.4714660644531	12.0	453.1799011230469	19
this destruction of diversity as the “homogenization of the world” (Sachs, 2006, 210). “The	70.62399291992188	361.2714538574219	12.0	453.6360168457031	19

The development period is marked by the peak of the linear belief that all cultures of	106.6199951171875	402.69146728515625	12.0	417.21600341796875	19

expressed in the UN Charter (Sachs, 2006). Tragically, in order to unify mankind by means of	70.62399291992188	430.2914733886719	12.0	453.3819885253906	19

3. THE UNITED STATES AND MARKET UNITY	70.62399291992188	513.3314208984375	12.0	266.7499694824219	20
Following World War II, the United States found itself as the major victor of the war	98.9439926147461	545.25146484375	12.0	424.9559097290039	21
(along with the Soviet Union) and commenced to rebuild the world in its own image.	70.62399291992188	559.0814208984375	12.0	453.2281188964844	21
Globalization and unity of the market was viewed, by those in power in the U.S. government,	70.62399291992188	572.8814697265625	12.0	453.5760192871094	21
as the best and only way to maintain the superiority of the U.S. and achieve peace in the	70.62399291992188	586.6814575195312	12.0	453.2040100097656	21
world. When the Cold War began the U.S. government quickly created the either/or narrative	70.62399291992188	600.4814453125	12.0	453.6120300292969	21
of good capitalist versus evil communist. This served Washington’s hegemonic aspirations	70.62399291992188	614.281494140625	12.0	453.6160583496094	21
perfectly. It gave the U.S. a pretext for invading, occupying, and meddling in the affairs of	70.62399291992188	628.0814819335938	12.0	453.2840270996094	21
other countries around the world, as well as dividing the globe into allies and enemies. Of	70.62399291992188	641.8814697265625	12.0	453.6359558105469	21
course, the allies were always conveniently defined by Washington as those states that	70.62399291992188	655.6814575195312	12.0	453.5259704589844	21
adhered to capitalist market principles. Since the end of World War II the driving force	70.62399291992188	669.4814453125	12.0	453.5019836425781	21
behind Westernization and the so-called civilizing process has undeniably been the U.S.	70.62399291992188	683.281494140625	12.0	422.1700134277344	21
A new form of imperialism was born with its main objective being the pursuit of	106.6199951171875	697.0814819335938	12.0	417.5780029296875	21
global market unity (Sachs, 2006). The traditional way of exercising domination over others	70.62399291992188	710.9014892578125	12.0	453.1801452636719	21
was recast and disguised in the deceptive altruistic albeit ethnocentric language of	70.62399291992188	724.7014770507812	12.0	453.5320129394531	21
development. Truman stated in his inaugural address that “the United States is pre-eminent	70.62399291992188	738.50146484375	12.0	453.5400085449219	21
among nations in the development of industrial and scientific techniques.” (Truman, 1949).	70.62399291992188	752.3014526367188	12.0	453.2400817871094	21

And so it was narrowly assumed that the United States was the most advanced civilization,	70.62399291992188	99.04150390625	12.0	453.3840026855469	24
possessing the one truth, with a moral responsibility of helping the rest of the world to	70.62399291992188	112.84149169921875	12.0	453.2539367675781	24
industrialize, particularly those cultures outside of the capitalist system with different ways of	70.62399291992188	126.6414794921875	12.0	453.1919860839844	24
being and relating to the world. Difference continues to be seen as an obstacle to development	70.62399291992188	140.44146728515625	12.0	453.5760192871094	24
and world economic unity. It has been noted that “the neo-liberal ideology of the absolute	70.62399291992188	154.24151611328125	12.0	453.5859680175781	24
market is presented as the only option, and all movements that resists it and its attendant	70.62399291992188	168.04150390625	12.0	453.1200256347656	24
injustices must therefore be opposed” (Duchrow and Hinkelammert).	70.62399291992188	181.84149169921875	12.0	331.7160339355469	24
Sachs points out that this project for economic unity has actually become an oppressive	98.9439926147461	195.6414794921875	12.0	424.95206451416016	24
force to governments all over the world (Sachs, 2006). It is precisely this type of economic	70.62399291992188	209.44146728515625	12.0	453.4419860839844	24
competition that prevents countries from tackling more pressing problems, such as, looming	70.62399291992188	223.24151611328125	12.0	453.8559875488281	24
environmental catastrophes and pollution caused by capitalist production.	70.62399291992188	237.04150390625	12.0	353.1600341796875	24
Duchrow and Hinkelammert give a dire assessment of the effects of market unity:	98.9439926147461	250.87152099609375	12.0	392.97608184814453	24
The globalization of the market means that the nation-state has less and less	106.6199951171875	270.4315185546875	12.0	389.41998291015625	25
power to intervene in economic policy when social considerations dictate.	106.6199951171875	284.23150634765625	12.0	389.3879699707031	25
Instead capital employs every conceivable means to drive profits ever higher,	106.6199951171875	298.031494140625	12.0	389.1719665527344	25
without any consideration for people and the environment, and in this way	106.6199951171875	311.83148193359375	12.0	389.3759765625	25
evades the constitutional obligation to sustain life (Duchrow and Hinkelammert,	106.6199951171875	325.6314697265625	12.0	389.4259948730469	25

“Not to lose ground in the economic arena has become an obsession which dominates politics	70.62399291992188	357.7914733886719	12.0	453.2760925292969	26
down to the local level” (Sachs, 2006, 215). The world market has become, as Sachs calls it, a	70.62399291992188	371.5914611816406	12.0	453.5259704589844	26
despotic dictator that dominates both rich and poor countries (Sachs, 2006, 215). Thus, the	70.62399291992188	385.3914489746094	12.0	453.6880187988281	26
quest for unifying all cultures into one Western overarching capitalist system has become a	70.62399291992188	399.2114562988281	12.0	453.2040100097656	26
threat to everyone everywhere, even to those who exercise power within the capitalist system.	70.62399291992188	413.011474609375	12.0	450.8039855957031	26
The conquest of foreign markets trumped the conquest of foreign territories (Sachs,	98.9439926147461	426.81146240234375	12.0	425.1760025024414	26
2006). Yet, the impact has been just as brutal and devastating to the conquered local	70.62399291992188	440.6114501953125	12.0	453.6159973144531	26
populations. As the capitalist system forces different cultures to conform to Western	70.62399291992188	454.4114685058594	12.0	453.5760192871094	26
consumerism in its quest for market unity, it marches towards an impending abyss, facing the	70.62399291992188	468.2114562988281	12.0	453.2159729003906	26
annihilation of all life on earth with the collapse of the ecosystem. Outrageously, the original	70.62399291992188	482.011474609375	12.0	453.4960021972656	26
sin, namely global unity, is now being touted as the only solution to the advancing threat to	70.62399291992188	495.81146240234375	12.0	453.6039733886719	26
the environment. Again, the unity discourse has been recast, not to spread Western	70.62399291992188	509.6114501953125	12.0	453.5019836425781	26
civilization, but to save it (Sachs, 2006). The market has connected the world in such a way	70.62399291992188	523.4114990234375	12.0	453.5739440917969	26
that individual actions in one place may harm others living in a different place. We are now	70.62399291992188	537.21142578125	12.0	453.5319519042969	26
living in a time where people are linked together by “their shared dependence on biophysical	70.62399291992188	551.04150390625	12.0	453.1800842285156	26
life-support systems” (Sachs, 2006). Therefore, saving the planet from environmental global	70.62399291992188	564.8414306640625	12.0	453.3739929199219	26

Even before the attacks of September 11th, the United States was already obsessed with	98.9439926147461	617.708740234375	14.33270263671875	425.19998931884766	26
national security. Westernizing other cultures and those deemed as different is one of the	70.62399291992188	633.8414306640625	12.0	453.2479553222656	26

capitalist system that it is built upon. Andrew J. Bacevich argues that after World War II	70.62399291992188	661.4414672851562	12.0	453.5619201660156	26
Washington believed that global responsibility fell upon the United States and “the United	70.62399291992188	675.241455078125	12.0	453.7839660644531	26
States alone to lead, save, liberate, and ultimately transform the world” (Bacevich, 2010, 12).	70.62399291992188	689.0414428710938	12.0	447.3320617675781	26
The U.S. global war on terror is being used (like the Cold War) to justify its neoliberal	98.9439926147461	702.8614501953125	12.0	424.9340591430664	26
development policies and interference in other states’ politics. This has led the U.S.	70.62399291992188	716.6614379882812	12.0	453.7240295410156	26
government to continue and even expand its support for antidemocratic policies in other	70.62399291992188	730.4614868164062	12.0	453.8519592285156	26

form of neoliberalism with Chinese characteristics, notes that “wage levels in China are	70.62399291992188	264.6715087890625	12.0	453.4560241699219	29
extremely low, and conditions of labour are sufficiently unregulated, despotic, and	70.62399291992188	278.47149658203125	12.0	453.2959289550781	29
exploitative…” (Harvey, 2005, 148).	70.62399291992188	292.271484375	12.0	177.1920166015625	29
Yet, China has created an attractive business climate for international corporations.	98.9439926147461	306.07147216796875	12.0	424.91996002197266	29
And since China is not a democracy it is able to make economic decisions almost by decree	70.62399291992188	319.87152099609375	11.999969482421875	453.4960021972656	29

as it happens in the U.S. In short, capitalism in China is proving to be more efficient and	70.62399291992188	347.4714660644531	12.0	453.4960021972656	29
profitable an economic model to be emulated. The American pursuit of reshaping the world in	70.62399291992188	361.2714538574219	12.0	453.4960632324219	29
its image specifically by unifying the market is now threatening to eliminate democratic and	70.62399291992188	375.07147216796875	12.0	453.3940124511719	29

Chinese communist-run capitalism is an ominous sign that the marriage between capitalism	70.62399291992188	402.69146728515625	12.0	453.3020324707031	29

The perceived limitation of democracy in contributing to economic growth has surely	98.9439926147461	430.2914733886719	12.0	425.1600112915039	29
been noticed by the U.S. government and the corporate elites who wield power over it. As a	70.62399291992188	444.0914611816406	12.0	453.4420471191406	29
consequence, politicians in the U.S. are attempting to strip away workers’ rights and all	70.62399291992188	457.8914489746094	12.0	453.3000183105469	29
regulations that may hinder the profits of giant corporations. Charles and David Koch the	70.62399291992188	471.69146728515625	12.0	453.6120300292969	29
fourth richest Americans have “promoted their free market ideology and business interests	70.62399291992188	485.491455078125	12.0	453.4340515136719	29
through aggressive lobbying in Washington DC, and financial support of political candidates”	70.62399291992188	499.2914733886719	12.0	453.5920715332031	29
(Abeshouse, 2011). Furthermore, the Koch brothers are infamous for their support and	70.62399291992188	513.0914306640625	12.0	453.3260192871094	29

level, except for protecting the profits of the super-rich. They see “virtually all regulation as	70.62399291992188	540.6914672851562	12.0	453.3700256347656	29
interference with the free market” (Abeshouse, 2011).	70.62399291992188	554.521484375	12.0	259.14007568359375	29
The aim of the West, and particularly the U.S., is to unify all countries under a capitalist	98.9439926147461	568.3214721679688	12.0	425.08609771728516	29
economic model; but now, as we are witnessing in the current economic crisis, all countries	70.62399291992188	582.1214599609375	12.0	453.2040100097656	29
within the Western capitalist tent are sharing in the pain and collapse of the capitalist system.	70.62399291992188	595.9214477539062	12.0	453.1919250488281	29
A universal solution is susceptible to error and can potentially lead to universal suffering.	70.62399291992188	609.721435546875	12.0	453.2839660644531	29
This is precisely the danger of space-centered universalism. It puts all of its eggs into one	70.62399291992188	623.521484375	12.0	453.5740051269531	29

It may be noteworthy to mention that the economic crisis of 2008 did not have as much	98.9439926147461	651.1214599609375	12.0	425.01798248291016	29
of an effect on Muslim countries with Islamic financial institutions. Indonesia, for example,	70.62399291992188	664.9214477539062	12.0	453.6040344238281	29
did not suffer economically like Western countries. “Islamic law prohibits the payment and	70.62399291992188	678.721435546875	12.0	453.5639953613281	29

Transactions must be backed by real assets, and because risk is shared between the bank	98.9439926147461	706.3414306640625	12.0	424.8840103149414	29

(Williamson, 2009). Hence difference was the redeeming factor. This is just one of many	70.62399291992188	733.9414672851562	12.0	453.7119445800781	29

The impact of space-centered universalism, which was a product of the Enlightenment,	98.9439926147461	117.4014892578125	12.0	424.97013092041016	33
has been devastating to cultures on every continent. The loss of indigenous wisdom,	70.62399291992188	131.20147705078125	12.0	453.5379943847656	33
creativity, and different ways of relating to the world, have created a dangerous unity of one	70.62399291992188	145.00146484375	12.0	453.1560363769531	33
absolute truth, namely, the unity of global capitalism and the belief that Western civilization	70.62399291992188	158.801513671875	12.0	453.4080505371094	33
is the best and only way to organize the world. Moreover, a multitude of languages that	70.62399291992188	172.60150146484375	12.0	453.4060363769531	33
enable unique varieties of human expression have been extinguished, never to be regained. As	70.62399291992188	186.4014892578125	12.0	453.2160339355469	33
other economies rise to rival the U.S., the universal virus of global capitalism the destroyer of	70.62399291992188	200.20147705078125	12.0	453.5080261230469	33
cultures forces those in power in the U.S. to deregulate industries and strip away democratic	70.62399291992188	214.00146484375	12.0	453.2959289550781	33
rights in order to keep up with its competitors in a race to the bottom.	70.62399291992188	227.801513671875	12.0	332.7720031738281	33
Despite this grim description of the hegemonic pursuit for unity, we may be comforted	98.9439926147461	241.6314697265625	12.0	425.14005279541016	33
by the recent emergence of social movements around the world that are discontent with the	70.62399291992188	255.4315185546875	12.0	453.3840026855469	33
status quo. From the Arab Spring to the Los Indignados in Spain, and finally, to the Occupy	70.62399291992188	269.23150634765625	12.0	453.4560241699219	33
Wall Street movement in the U.S., people are demanding alternatives to the market-driven	70.62399291992188	283.031494140625	12.0	453.5639343261719	33
capitalist system that has eradicated diversity, increased the income gap between the rich and	70.62399291992188	296.83148193359375	12.0	453.2039489746094	33
poor, and is devastating the ecosystem.	70.62399291992188	310.6314697265625	12.0	187.50799560546875	33
The Occupy Wall Street Movement has been criticized for its lack of unity, leadership,	98.9439926147461	324.43145751953125	12.0	425.2439956665039	33
and ability to clearly articulate specific demands. These critics, however, fail to understand	70.62399291992188	338.2314758300781	12.0	453.3360290527344	33
that difference is indeed strength. In other words, the protesters are being criticized for not	70.62399291992188	352.0314636230469	12.0	453.3260192871094	33
being prescriptive, not having a universal solution already prepared. The discontent that is	70.62399291992188	365.8314514160156	12.0	453.7120666503906	33
manifested in these social movements is the result of the failure of Western universalism.	70.62399291992188	379.6314697265625	12.0	453.2039489746094	33
People are not demanding just one way for all peoples and cultures of the world, they are	70.62399291992188	393.43145751953125	12.0	453.2520446777344	33
demanding different ways to globalization and market-driven capitalism.	70.62399291992188	407.25146484375	12.0	349.7740173339844	33
I am not suggesting that the protesters should not eventually make specific demands.	98.9439926147461	421.05145263671875	12.0	425.0760269165039	33
On the contrary, the protesters are already unified insofar as they are demanding alternatives	70.62399291992188	434.8514709472656	12.0	453.1560363769531	33
to universalism and the status quo. “Their basic message is: the taboo is broken; we do not	70.62399291992188	448.6514587402344	12.0	453.3499450683594	33
live in the best possible world; we are allowed, obliged even, to think about alternatives”	70.62399291992188	462.4514465332031	12.0	453.3360290527344	33
(Zizek, 2011).	70.62399291992188	476.25146484375	12.0	68.14801025390625	33
The Occupy Wall Street movement has already had an impact on the political discourse	98.9439926147461	490.05145263671875	12.0	424.94400787353516	33
in Washington D.C. Those politicians who initially criticized the Occupy Wall Street	70.62399291992188	503.8514404296875	12.0	453.3499450683594	33
movement are now attempting to placate and hijack it for their own political advantage. “In	70.62399291992188	517.6514892578125	12.0	453.6839294433594	33
the same way we get coffee without caffeine, beer without alcohol, ice-cream without fat,	70.62399291992188	531.451416015625	12.0	453.4839782714844	33
those in power will try to make the protests into a harmless moralistic gesture” (Zizek, 2011).	70.62399291992188	545.25146484375	12.0	448.6560363769531	33
The horizontal structure of the movement allows it to be leaderless and creates an	98.9439926147461	559.0814208984375	12.0	425.24405670166016	33
egalitarian environment. This, I believe, is another important strength of the movement.	70.62399291992188	572.8814697265625	12.0	453.6400451660156	33
Thus, the arrest or killing of a beloved charismatic leader (i.e., Martin Luther King, Jr.) will	70.62399291992188	586.6814575195312	12.0	453.6480407714844	33
not pacify the movement. It also leaves those in power, who wish to crush the movement,	70.62399291992188	600.4814453125	12.0	453.3139953613281	33
confused about how to stop it.	70.62399291992188	614.281494140625	12.0	144.6840057373047	33
I will conclude with this quote by the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek regarding the	98.9439926147461	628.0814819335938	12.0	425.0180435180664	33
Occupy Wall Street protesters:	70.62399291992188	641.8814697265625	12.0	147.50401306152344	33
They are dismissed as dreamers, but the true dreamers are those who think	106.6199951171875	660.241455078125	12.0	389.135986328125	34
things can go on indefinitely the way they are, just with some cosmetic changes.	106.6199951171875	674.0414428710938	12.0	388.93194580078125	34
They are not dreamers; they are the awakening from a dream that is turning into	106.6199951171875	687.8414306640625	12.0	389.3000183105469	34
a nightmare. They are not destroying anything, but reacting to how the system is	106.6199951171875	701.6414794921875	12.0	389.24798583984375	34
gradually destroying itself. We all know the classic scene from cartoons: the cat	106.6199951171875	715.4614868164062	12.0	389.0099792480469	34
reaches a precipice but goes on walking; it starts to fall only when it looks down	106.6199951171875	729.261474609375	12.0	389.3119812011719	34
and notices the abyss. The protesters are just reminding those in power to look	106.6199951171875	743.0614624023438	12.0	389.20196533203125	34
