SAA and Croatia’s accession to the EU? The main change is that, upon	154.86660766601562	191.14532470703125	10.0	284.5870666503906	57

restriction. This means that they will not be restricted to buying only	154.86660766601562	239.58135986328125	10.0	284.59002685546875	57

It is not clear whether these implications of EU accession are	183.21261596679688	336.4534606933594	10.0	256.2590637207031	57

pleted property. For instance, an entrepreneur could buy up large	154.86610412597656	518.6876220703125	10.0	284.5861053466797	57

The lack of capital largely prevents Croatian citizens from engaging	154.86610412597656	616.359619140625	10.0	284.6011199951172	57
in such activities at the moment, so the weakness of anti-speculative	154.86610412597656	628.5686645507812	10.0	284.5920867919922	57
regulations may not be obvious. But once the property market is	154.86610412597656	640.7776489257812	10.0	284.5880584716797	57

The arguments for either the Maltese or the Danish exemption may not	154.86610412597656	191.0599365234375	10.0	284.5921173095703	113
be easily applied to Croatia. Moreover, as discussed in the conclusion,	154.86610412597656	203.0849609375	10.0	284.6670379638672	113
no country can expect to benefit from the rights of membership if at the	154.86610412597656	215.1099853515625	10.0	284.59092712402344	113
same time it does not want to shoulder the obligations. The challenge in	154.86610412597656	227.135009765625	10.0	284.5908660888672	113
this particular case will be, first, to identify an important national inter-	154.86610412597656	239.1600341796875	10.0	284.59791564941406	113
est (if any) in postponing the liberalisation of the real estate market for	154.86610412597656	251.18505859375	10.0	284.5959014892578	113
non-residents; and second, to demonstrate that applying unrestricted	154.86610412597656	263.2100830078125	10.0	284.5898895263672	113
rights of EU residents to acquire property in Croatia would go against	154.86610412597656	275.235107421875	10.0	284.58692932128906	113
this interest for an extended period of time. One obvious candidate for	154.86610412597656	287.2601318359375	10.0	284.5849151611328	113
such an interest is the need to limit property speculation. Such a move	154.86610412597656	299.28515625	10.0	284.5879364013672	113
would not go against the spirit of EU accession because other EU mem-	154.86610412597656	311.3101806640625	10.0	284.5858917236328	113
ber countries have such legislation. The sections that follow elaborate	154.86610412597656	323.335205078125	10.0	284.59385681152344	113
several other economic arguments that tend to support the case for a	154.86610412597656	335.3601989746094	10.0	284.5879364013672	113

accession to the EU. Restrictions on property sales were similar to	169.03939819335938	431.18536376953125	9.5	256.2472839355469	114
those presently used in Croatia – the sale required prior approval,	169.03939819335938	442.6100769042969	9.5	256.2472839355469	114
only one secondary residence of limited size could be acquired by	169.03939819335938	454.0347900390625	9.5	256.23968505859375	114
non-residents, and the value of property had to be above a certain	169.03939819335938	465.4595031738281	9.5	256.2434997558594	114
limit. The rationale for these restrictions was to retain a measure of	169.03939819335938	476.88421630859375	9.5	256.26348876953125	114
control on land use and to prevent speculation. Foreigners could	169.03939819335938	488.3089294433594	9.5	256.2388000488281	114

dence only if they obtained Maltese nationality.	169.03939819335938	511.1583251953125	9.5	182.64987182617188	114
During accession talks, Malta requested to be able to keep	197.385498046875	522.5830688476562	9.5	227.89642333984375	114

ticular concerned that if EU residents had unrestricted access to the	169.03939819335938	545.4324951171875	9.5	256.2548828125	114

widespread economic and social problems. They supported their	169.03939819335938	568.2819213867188	9.5	256.2445373535156	114
case by several well-founded arguments.	169.03939819335938	579.7066040039062	9.499984741210938	155.77340698242188	114

Second, they argued that, if the right of EU citizens to buy	197.38580322265625	185.0675048828125	9.5	227.89553833007812	120
property in Malta after membership led to an increase in demand for	169.03970336914062	196.77435302734375	9.5	256.2568664550781	120
property, this could affect property prices and have a negative social	169.03970336914062	208.481201171875	9.5	256.2444152832031	120

concern was that EU membership should not add to the problem by	169.03970336914062	255.30859375	9.5	256.24066162109375	120

Third, they argued that concerns about housing affordabili-	197.38580322265625	278.7222900390625	9.5	227.89935302734375	120

should a problem arise, it would be greater in future than at present,	169.03970336914062	302.135986328125	9.5	256.2444763183594	120
affecting future generations more than the current ones. This is why	169.03970336914062	313.84283447265625	9.5	256.24639892578125	120
a transitional period was not sufficient for Malta: only a permanent	169.03970336914062	325.5496826171875	9.5	256.255859375	120

The European Commission accepted these arguments and	197.38580322265625	348.96337890625	9.5	227.89837646484375	120

Although there are no comprehensive data on sales in the sec-	183.2126007080078	179.03631591796875	10.0	256.25001525878906	148

strained in this market as well. Perhaps the most important reason is	154.86660766601562	202.75836181640625	10.0	284.59503173828125	148
that many properties – including many of those temporarily unoccupied	154.86660766601562	214.619384765625	10.0	284.592041015625	148
– do not have clean titles, so many potential trades cannot be realised.	154.86660766601562	226.48040771484375	10.0	284.5849914550781	148
As discussed below, this state of affairs is due to huge backlogs in the	154.86660766601562	238.3414306640625	10.0	284.59112548828125	148
judiciary, the often chaotic state of property registers and deficiencies	154.86660766601562	250.20245361328125	10.0	284.5979919433594	148
in urban planning and the enforcement of building relations.	154.86660766601562	262.0634765625	10.0	242.7410888671875	148
Furthermore, much of the housing stock has been privatised to	183.21261596679688	273.92449951171875	10.0	256.2460021972656	148
occupiers for nominal payments or at no cost. Privatisation thus result-	154.86660766601562	285.7855224609375	10.0	284.59912109375	148
ed in windfall gains according to who happened to be living in a	154.86660766601562	297.64654541015625	10.0	284.5831298828125	148
dwelling at the time. Many people therefore occupy dwellings that they	154.86660766601562	309.507568359375	10.0	284.5910339355469	148
would not otherwise be in a position to afford. Such properties are not	154.86660766601562	321.36859130859375	10.000030517578125	284.5859680175781	148
likely to be offered for sale, which limits the effective supply.	154.86660766601562	333.2296142578125	10.0	249.61602783203125	148
The third reason is that standards of construction were often	183.21261596679688	345.0906066894531	10.0	256.2530212402344	148
poor, resulting in problems with the quality of many existing dwellings.	154.86660766601562	356.95159912109375	10.0	284.5891418457031	148
According to the 2001 Census, one-third of Croatia’s housing stock is	154.86660766601562	368.8125915527344	10.0	284.5821228027344	148
older than 45 years (i.e., constructed up to 1960); 60% was constructed	154.86660766601562	380.673583984375	10.0	284.5840759277344	148
between 1961 and 1990; and only 8% since 1991. From an investment	154.86660766601562	392.5345764160156	10.0	284.5790710449219	148
point of view, the amortisation period for buildings is usually 50 years,	154.86660766601562	404.39556884765625	10.0	284.5840759277344	148
so the bulk of the housing stock in Croatia is close to or past its useful	154.86660766601562	416.2565612792969	10.0	284.5920104980469	148
life. This also means that privatisation has saddled many occupiers with	154.86660766601562	428.1175537109375	10.0	284.5889892578125	148
liabilities in the form of high maintenance obligations.	154.86660766601562	439.9785461425781	10.0	219.46505737304688	148
Finally, as part of the economic transformation, the public sector	183.21261596679688	451.83953857421875	10.0	256.2460632324219	148
has largely pulled out of the housing construction business, while private	154.86660766601562	463.7005310058594	10.0	284.5871276855469	148
firms have not yet expanded sufficiently to bridge the gap in all segments	154.86660766601562	475.5615234375	10.0	284.5931091308594	148
of the market. In particular, the financial problems of the public sector	154.86660766601562	487.4225158691406	10.0	284.5960998535156	148
have resulted in a sharp decline in the construction of social housing.	154.86660766601562	499.28350830078125	10.0	271.7501525878906	148
On the basis of these observations, one can form a working	183.21261596679688	511.14453125	10.0	256.2429504394531	148
hypothesis that the supply of housing is presently tight in both primary	154.86660766601562	523.0054931640625	10.0	284.5841064453125	148
and secondary markets. The question is, then, what is the likely impact	154.86660766601562	534.866455078125	10.0	284.5940856933594	148
of growing demand for vacation homes by foreigners on the residential	154.86660766601562	546.7274780273438	10.0	284.5920104980469	148
property market? In particular, how realistic are fears, often expressed	154.86660766601562	558.5885009765625	10.0	284.60198974609375	148
in the public, that rising prices of summer vacation homes along the	154.86660766601562	570.449462890625	10.0	284.5970458984375	148

ly affect the affordability of housing for ordinary Croatian households?	154.86660766601562	594.1714477539062	10.0	284.5990905761719	148
The potentially most important channel for the transmission of	183.21261596679688	605.9324340820312	10.0	256.2550048828125	148

tial housing market is the expectations channel. As with all assets, cur-	154.86660766601562	629.4544677734375	10.0	284.5980529785156	148
rent prices of real estate depend on expectations of future prices. The	154.86660766601562	641.2154541015625	10.0	284.5950012207031	148
housing market seems to be tight at the moment, so price increases in	154.86660766601562	652.9764404296875	10.0	284.5899658203125	148

to other segments of the market. Most relevant in this context is the	154.86610412597656	190.74310302734375	10.0	284.59605407714844	151
market situation on the Adriatic coast and islands, where most of the	154.86610412597656	202.4541015625	10.0	284.5940399169922	151
property sales to foreigners are taking place. The number of permanent	154.86610412597656	214.16510009765625	10.0	284.60096740722656	151
dwellings on the coast and islands was 355,000 in 2001.xxiii In addition,	154.86610412597656	225.87506103515625	10.00103759765625	284.59690856933594	151
Croatians owned on the Adriatic about 118,000 vacation homes in	154.86599731445312	237.5860595703125	10.0	284.58209228515625	151

in Croatia. Thus, vacation homes are already a key segment of the hous-	154.86599731445312	261.008056640625	10.0	284.5960693359375	151

Given the relative size of this market segment and of reported	183.2126007080078	354.69317626953125	10.0	256.24900817871094	151
price increases, it is conceivable that rising prices of summer vacation	154.86660766601562	366.4041748046875	10.0	284.5990295410156	151

The second concern relates to construction costs. If the construc-	183.21240234375	567.614501953125	10.0	256.2460021972656	192

housing. To the extent that the construction industry is not competitive,	154.86639404296875	616.402587890625	10.0	284.5881042480469	192
the increase in costs – and hence the spillover on the local housing mar-	154.86639404296875	628.5995483398438	10.0	284.5960998535156	192

However, the index of housing affordability is very low in Croatia:	169.03939819335938	286.92010498046875	9.5	256.2474060058594	202

these practices in the past by the difficulty of enforcing foreclosure	169.03955078125	312.1632080078125	9.5	256.2539367675781	227

which is higher than in the euro area (about 80%). On this basis,	169.03939819335938	462.97308349609375	9.5	256.2416687011719	227

housing schemes can be attributed largely to state-provided incen-	169.03944396972656	602.1806030273438	9.5	256.24266052246094	227

Another approach to addressing housing affordability is via	197.385498046875	207.17352294921875	9.5	227.89730834960938	233

mer scheme, a total of 4,400 apartments have been constructed since	169.03939819335938	300.60028076171875	9.5	256.2471923828125	233
1997, with plans for a further 700 units. Under the latter scheme,	169.03939819335938	312.27862548828125	9.5	256.23870849609375	233
1,500 apartments have been constructed since 2000 and 8,000 more	169.03939819335938	323.95697021484375	9.5	256.2320556640625	233

A broader implication of this situation, rarely articulated in	197.38523864746094	429.0576477050781	9.5	227.91163635253906	233
public discussions, is that the current younger generation finds it	169.0391387939453	440.7359924316406	9.5	256.2416229248047	233

In summary, there is some evidence that increased demand for	183.2126007080078	628.6344604492188	10.0	256.25294494628906	234

The first point to note is that tourism in Croatia, as in other	183.21261596679688	333.0733337402344	10.0	256.2520751953125	279

The tourism practiced in Croatia and other southern European	183.2126007080078	225.5130615234375	10.0	256.25303649902344	285

The reason is that foreign companies are mainly interested in facilities	154.86610412597656	458.54876708984375	10.0	284.5990447998047	295

One important macroeconomic effect – the wealth effect – has	183.21261596679688	520.3270263671875	10.0	256.2599792480469	303

This clearly demonstrates the powerful impact that economic expecta-	154.86660766601562	568.5670166015625	10.0	284.5989685058594	303

amount to about 500 million euros, or nearly 2% of GDP. To put this	154.86610412597656	227.64837646484375	10.0	284.58396911621094	306

The main conclusion from the preceding analysis is that Croatia	183.2126007080078	485.6954650878906	10.0	256.25108337402344	311

Another general conclusion is that much additional research	183.21261596679688	641.2094116210938	10.0	256.2510070800781	311

Against this background, what approach could Croatia follow in	183.21209716796875	332.26324462890625	10.0	256.2410583496094	317

ty of negotiations on this point can be better understood when put in the	154.8660888671875	356.021240234375	10.0	284.5871276855469	317
proper perspective of the way that negotiations are conducted. By join-	154.8660888671875	367.9002380371094	10.0	284.59002685546875	317
ing the EU, a country accepts to adopt and apply the rules of the club.	154.8660888671875	379.77923583984375	10.0	284.5801086425781	317
Exceptionally, the EU agrees that certain rules can be adopted over a	154.8660888671875	391.6582336425781	10.0	284.5970764160156	317
longer time horizon after membership, provided that exceptions are	154.8660888671875	403.5372314453125	10.0	284.5970458984375	317
limited in scope and in time. Exceptions are therefore temporary in	154.8660888671875	415.4162292480469	10.0	284.593994140625	317
nature and granted to allow a country sufficient time to adapt. In the	154.8660888671875	427.29522705078125	10.0	284.5970458984375	317

od once negotiations on EU membership begin. But since other	154.8660888671875	474.81121826171875	10.0	284.589111328125	317

ferent areas, deciding whether, for instance, it is more important to	154.8660888671875	510.4482421875	10.0	284.6020812988281	317
request a longer transitional period for the real estate sector or for	154.8660888671875	522.3272094726562	10.0	284.6029968261719	317

Yet, if transitional periods are exceptional, it is evident that per-	183.21209716796875	546.085205078125	10.0	256.2520446777344	317

ruled out. The reason is that by their very nature derogations go against	154.8660888671875	569.8432006835938	10.0	284.5940246582031	317
the principle that the law is equal for all (Busuttil, 2002). Derogations	154.8660888671875	581.72216796875	10.0	284.59014892578125	317
also go against the spirit of acting in common, because they allow a	154.8660888671875	593.6011962890625	10.0	284.59307861328125	317
country to operate outside the scope of the law binding all the rest. If	154.8660888671875	605.480224609375	10.0	284.59100341796875	317
derogations applied in all cases, there would be no common action and	154.8660888671875	617.3591918945312	10.0	284.5860900878906	317
there would be little scope for having the EU at all. No country can	154.8660888671875	629.2381591796875	10.0	284.593994140625	317

straightforward. First, the authorities need to stabilise the expectations	154.86660766601562	482.8617248535156	10.0	284.59906005859375	320

has developed two such schemes, it is not clear that one of them (the	154.86610412597656	288.59307861328125	10.0	284.5890350341797	323

In Section 4 it was argued that the character of Croatia’s tourism	183.21209716796875	312.93902587890625	10.0	256.2510070800781	323

qualitatively from the pressures that tourist resorts are already experi-	154.8660888671875	361.6310729980469	10.0	284.6069641113281	323
encing with the robust growth of tourism in recent years. As for the	154.8660888671875	373.8040771484375	10.0	284.58905029296875	323
broader implications of EU accession on Croatia’s tourism industry,	154.8660888671875	385.9770812988281	10.0	284.5960998535156	323

ership of vacation homes. Thus far there has been little EU intervention	154.8660888671875	410.3230895996094	10.0	284.592041015625	323
in the field of tourism. Freedom of movement provisions, competition	154.8660888671875	422.49609375	10.0	284.5951232910156	323

(Williams, 2001). Most tourism regions in Croatia will have to face	154.8660888671875	446.84210205078125	10.0	284.593994140625	323
choices about diversifying their source and product markets, imposing	154.8660888671875	459.0151062011719	10.0	284.5940856933594	323

50% share in Spain. In the case of Croatia, this would imply purchases of	154.8660888671875	616.76416015625	10.0	284.58209228515625	323
