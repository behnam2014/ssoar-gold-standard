Contemporary power relations implicate animals in complex ways, which	53.5	187.62045288085938	10.0	323.716064453125	3
have yet to be fully appreciated by sociocultural theorists. Like the popular	53.5	199.52044677734375	10.0	323.7359619140625	3
British candy after which the book is named, Franklin approaches Dolly	53.5	211.42044067382812	10.0	323.715087890625	3
the cloned sheep as a novel mixture: at once a living creature, a rich cultural	53.5	223.3204345703125	10.0	323.7441101074219	3
symbol, a viable example of recombinant biotechnology, a commodity, a	53.5	235.22042846679688	10.0	323.7171325683594	3
cyborg, and the outcome of intersecting lineages. With Dolly Mixtures, an	53.5	247.09164428710938	10.028778076171875	323.7159729003906	3
ethnographic monograph instantiating the “animal turn” in social studies	53.5	259.0204162597656	10.0	323.72308349609375	3
of health science, Franklin makes a watershed contribution.	53.5	270.92041015625	10.0	265.3600769042969	3
Dolly Mixtures is a public ethnography, for several key informants have	64.5	282.7916259765625	10.028778076171875	312.70294189453125	3
published inﬂuential scientiﬁc papers, some of these scientists have become	53.5	294.72039794921875	10.0	323.7179870605469	3
public ﬁgures, and cloning is hotly debated in academic ﬁelds such as	53.49999237060547	306.6203918457031	10.0	323.71598052978516	3
bioethics as well in the mass media. Against this backdrop, Franklin must	53.499969482421875	318.5203857421875	10.0	323.7281188964844	3
have faced some daunting challenges in carrying out this project, from	53.499969482421875	330.4203796386719	10.0	323.7150573730469	3
negotiating access through to writing up. The very public status of Dolly and	53.499969482421875	342.32037353515625	10.0	323.7301025390625	3
of the topic of cloning certainly forces Franklin to specify her contribution.	53.499969482421875	354.2203674316406	10.0	323.6748962402344	3
She addresses, head-on in the introduction and discreetly throughout in	53.499969482421875	366.120361328125	10.0	323.71807861328125	3
her referencing practices, the role of science writing by sociocultural	53.499969482421875	378.0203552246094	10.0	323.7160949707031	3
scholars. Ultimately, Dolly Mixtures exempliﬁes a sort of science writing	53.499969482421875	389.8915710449219	10.028778076171875	323.71197509765625	3
that sociocultural scholars can and arguably should aim to do. Perhaps one	53.499969482421875	401.82037353515625	10.000015258789062	323.7831726074219	3
of the Franklin’s most important contributions is the deceptively simple	53.499969482421875	413.7203369140625	10.0	323.7141418457031	3
conversational style in which she has written Dolly Mixtures. Deeper	53.499969482421875	425.591552734375	10.02880859375	323.71600341796875	3
dialogue, versus dogmatic debate, is sorely needed to come to grips with	53.49993896484375	437.52032470703125	10.0	323.712158203125	3
shifts in the range of roles played by animals in human lives.	53.49993896484375	449.42034912109375	10.0	267.695068359375	3
Franklin (pp. 9–10) ardently defends society and culture as objects to	64.49993896484375	461.3203125	10.0	312.7151184082031	3
be analyzed through material refractions, Dolly being a case in point.	53.49993896484375	473.2203369140625	10.0	323.71514892578125	3
Thus, she explicitly rejects several inﬂuential scholars’ directives on how	53.49993896484375	485.12030029296875	10.0	323.7159729003906	3
to approach nonhuman entities. She is chieﬂy concerned with elucidating	53.49993896484375	497.02032470703125	10.0	323.7149963378906	3
and demonstrating how, in the course of exerting control over the lives	53.49993896484375	508.9202880859375	10.0	323.7191162109375	3
of sheep, people impose or otherwise bring about order in their own lives	53.49993896484375	520.8203125	10.0	323.73419189453125	3
and in the lives of other people. That is why she adopts “the in some ways	53.49993896484375	532.7202758789062	10.000007629394531	323.73016357421875	3
very conservative idiom of genealogy” (p.10).	53.49993896484375	544.6203002929688	10.0	202.48001098632812	3
Drawing from cultural studies, anthropology, gender and kinship	64.49993896484375	556.5203247070312	10.000007629394531	312.715087890625	3
theory, science studies, postcolonial criticism, the history of agriculture,	53.49993896484375	568.4202880859375	10.0	323.7150573730469	3
and the history of biology, Franklin foregrounds Dolly so as to investigate	53.49993896484375	580.3203125	10.000007629394531	323.71917724609375	3

the intersection between the materiality and representation. Although	65.19660186767578	47.6424560546875	10.0	323.16515350341797	6
scholarly attention to such entwinings of ‘nature / culture’ has a long history,	65.19660186767578	59.44244384765625	10.0	323.12609100341797	6
Franklin’s analysis offers a novel perspective in that she deftly illuminates	65.19660186767578	71.242431640625	10.0	323.16609954833984	6
how Dolly stems from but also disrupts lineages of capital, nation, empire,	65.19660186767578	83.04241943359375	10.0	323.1118392944336	6
and science. In accounting for Dolly’s life and times, Franklin considers the	65.19660186767578	94.8424072265625	10.0	323.11791229248047	6
just-past alongside the longue durée and the emerging present. For while	65.19660186767578	106.6136474609375	10.02874755859375	323.14696502685547	6
Dolly herself was cloned into existence, domesticated sheep attained their	65.19659423828125	118.4423828125	10.0	323.2059326171875	6
various bodily forms in relation to people’s desires for something warm	65.19659423828125	130.24237060546875	10.0	323.1501159667969	6
to wear and for something good to eat, and in relation to imperial desires	65.19659423828125	142.0423583984375	10.0	323.1441955566406	6
too. Nowadays, the frontiers straddled by animals akin to Dolly include	65.19659423828125	153.84234619140625	10.0	323.15008544921875	6
science and aspirations for longevity. Ultimately, Franklin’s attention to	65.19659423828125	165.642333984375	10.0	323.15118408203125	6
genealogy in context is what makes her analysis so textured, dynamic, and	65.19659423828125	177.44232177734375	10.0	323.147216796875	6
interesting.	65.19659423828125	189.2423095703125	10.0	49.9949951171875	6
Franklin does not offer a problem-and-solution analysis, whether on	76.19659423828125	201.04229736328125	10.0	312.1481628417969	6
moral, political, or economic grounds; rather, similar to Donna Haraway’s	65.19659423828125	212.84228515625	10.0	323.1841735839844	6
contributions to critical theory, she aims to create new critical sensibilities	65.19659423828125	224.64227294921875	10.0	323.1220703125	6
that allow us to make sense of Dolly’s coming into being, and of her passing.	65.19659423828125	236.4422607421875	10.0	323.15594482421875	6
Although somatic cell nuclear transfer, the technology central to the Dolly	65.19659423828125	248.24224853515625	10.0	323.139892578125	6
technique, is both inefﬁcient and expensive, Dolly nonetheless represented	65.19659423828125	260.042236328125	10.0	323.1279296875	6
an innovation. Franklin shows that animals animate health politics not only	65.19659423828125	271.84222412109375	10.0	323.1080322265625	6
as disease models, but also as sources of food and therapeutics. The use of	65.19659423828125	283.6422119140625	10.0	323.1750793457031	6
animals and animal parts to produce therapeutics intended to enter human	65.19659423828125	295.44219970703125	10.0	323.1671447753906	6
bodies is sometimes called pharming, and indeed the products derived	65.19659423828125	307.2421875	10.0	323.1531677246094	6
from animals include pharmaceuticals. For example, most insulin products	65.19659423828125	319.04217529296875	10.0	323.1261291503906	6
used to treat human diabetics still derive from porcine insulin. As Franklin	65.19659423828125	330.8421630859375	10.0	323.1100769042969	6
(p. 195) points out, Dolly was used not as livestock but as lifestock; in other	65.19659423828125	342.64215087890625	10.0	323.1219482421875	6
words, Dolly was not necessarily a viable agricultural commodity but was	65.19659423828125	354.442138671875	10.0	323.1551208496094	6
a principle or base biotechnology that helped inaugurate a postgenomic	65.19659423828125	366.24212646484375	10.0	323.151123046875	6
future/present rooted in stem cell science and tissue engineering. These	65.19659423828125	378.0421142578125	10.0	323.1611328125	6
technologies carry transformative implications for agriculture, medical	65.19659423828125	389.84210205078125	10.0	323.1520690917969	6
research, and embodiment. These implications are why, Franklin argues,	65.19659423828125	401.6421203613281	10.0	323.1531066894531	6
we desperately need new critical language to make sense of Dolly, not to	65.19659423828125	413.442138671875	10.0	323.15313720703125	6
celebrate ‘Dollymania’ nor to condemn emergent biotechnologies but to	65.19659423828125	425.24212646484375	10.0	323.1480712890625	6
understand what such ovine-machines imply for future human/nonhuman	65.19659423828125	437.0421142578125	10.0	323.1490783691406	6

Dolly Mixtures comprises an introduction followed by ﬁve chapters	76.19659423828125	460.61334228515625	10.02880859375	312.14898681640625	6
and conclusion bearing titles made up of a single word: “Origins,” “Sex,”	65.19659423828125	472.442138671875	10.0	323.15618896484375	6
“Capital,” “Nation,” “Colony,” “Death,” and “Breeds.” One way to read	65.19659423828125	484.24212646484375	10.0	323.1490783691406	6
Dolly Mixtures is as an analytic reﬂection on how meanings and practices	65.19659423828125	496.01336669921875	10.028778076171875	323.1479797363281	6
have shifted since Raymond Williams’s (1983 [1976]) Keywords was last	65.19659423828125	507.8133544921875	10.02880859375	323.1489562988281	6
revised. Franklin expressly pays homage to Williams: “The ability of the	65.19656372070312	519.6421508789062	10.0	323.1551818847656	6
rural farm animal to evoke what Raymond Williams calls ‘whole ways	65.19656372070312	531.442138671875	10.0	323.1551513671875	6
of life and whole ways of struggle’ captures one of the most important	65.19656372070312	543.2421875	10.0	323.14703369140625	6
sources of emotional attachment to sheep as embodiments of human labor,	65.19656372070312	555.0421752929688	10.0	323.14007568359375	6
industry, and accomplishment” (p. 193). Later, Franklin turns to Williams	65.19656372070312	566.8421630859375	10.0	323.10791015625	6
for an epigraph on “production and reproduction” in the concluding	65.19656372070312	578.6421508789062	10.0	323.087890625	6

chapter entitled, “Breeds” (p. 195) Keywords contains entries on “Sex,”	53.858001708984375	47.9527587890625	10.02874755859375	323.1529846191406	9
“Capitalism,” “Nationalist,” and “Imperialism,” but not on origins or on	53.858001708984375	59.781494140625	10.0	323.14813232421875	9
death. The absence of entries on “origins” or on “death” or, for that matter,	53.858001708984375	71.58148193359375	10.0	323.1291198730469	9
on “life” in Keywords may imply that, over the past 25 years or so, cultural	53.858001708984375	83.35272216796875	10.02874755859375	323.1180114746094	9
politics has come to be more about efforts bent on exerting control over	53.858009338378906	95.18145751953125	10.0	323.15319061279297	9
cells, organisms, and entire populations. But if so, Franklin’s focus on	53.858009338378906	106.9814453125	10.0	323.1451644897461	9
Dolly gives pause, for Dolly’s body was a nonhuman one, even if created	53.858009338378906	118.78143310546875	10.0	323.1500473022461	9
and shaped in relation to human desires.	53.858009338378906	130.5814208984375	10.0	180.2149887084961	9
Not one monograph can ever be said to wholly complete, and as we have	64.8580093383789	142.38140869140625	10.0	312.1188278198242	9
already noted, one of the main contributions that Franklin makes is to	53.858009338378906	154.181396484375	10.0	323.1451644897461	9

Franklin (p.. 9–10, 15–16) “sheepishly” owns up to a number of limitations,	53.858009338378906	177.7813720703125	10.0	323.12682342529297	9
including this telling comment: “As an astute reader of noted of its	53.858009338378906	189.58135986328125	10.0	323.15013885498047	9
meandering path and stupefying accumulation of ovine detail, the problem	53.858009338378906	201.38134765625	10.0	323.1168441772461	9

chapter could be read alongside research documenting the recent impact	53.8580322265625	319.3812255859375	10.0	323.1510314941406	9
of foot-and-mouth disease (e.g., Mort et al., 2005). As Franklin helps to	53.8580322265625	331.18121337890625	10.0	323.1551818847656	9
