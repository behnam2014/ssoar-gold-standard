Abstract	121.86000061035156	235.02337646484375	12.0	44.694000244140625	13
Despite the obvious existence of civil society organizations (CSOs) and forms of	104.8800048828125	266.683349609375	12.0	402.6264343261719	14
civic engagement, the data available for this sector remains inadequate. This expert	104.8800048828125	287.38336181640625	12.0	402.593994140625	14
report provides a comprehensive view of the current data situation, reveals existing	104.8800048828125	308.0833740234375	12.0	402.59521484375	14
gaps, and offers suggestions on how these gaps might be closed.	104.87998962402344	328.78338623046875	12.0	308.5847930908203	14
The empirical material currently provided by existing data sources - the Federal	104.8800048828125	349.4833984375	12.0	402.56640625	14
Statistical Office, statistics from the CSOs themselves, as well as special data and	104.8800048828125	370.18341064453125	12.0	402.67559814453125	14
surveys - only register this area separately and to a limited extent, and even then	104.8800048828125	390.8834228515625	12.0	402.751220703125	14
not in a consistent manner. With respect to both civil society organizations and	104.8800048828125	411.58343505859375	12.0	402.6239318847656	14
forms of individual engagement there is an inadequate data situation. Questions	104.8800048828125	432.283447265625	12.0	402.6767883300781	14
that have arisen around whether CSOs will remain oriented toward civil society in	104.8800048828125	452.98345947265625	12.0	402.6563720703125	14
a context of increased economic pressure on organizations cannot be answered.	104.8800048828125	473.6834716796875	12.0	402.7104797363281	14
Similarly, it is nearly impossible to analyze whether civic engagement belies an	104.8800048828125	494.38348388671875	12.0	402.6023864746094	14
increased tendency towards monetarization.	104.87998962402344	515.08349609375	12.0	210.70079040527344	14
Since civil society will undoubtedly continue to gain in political and social	104.87998962402344	535.7835083007812	12.0	402.66600036621094	14
importance, the long-term task will be to set up a meaningful and a predominantly	104.8800048828125	556.4835205078125	12.0	402.7463684082031	14
self-contained system of data collection and provision. This goal can be reached by	104.8800048828125	577.1835327148438	11.999984741210938	402.59283447265625	14

Introduction	106.26000213623047	102.0032958984375	12.0	65.34000396728516	18
The term “civil society” attracts a range of paraphrases and definitions. One of the most	70.86000061035156	133.7232666015625	12.0	453.62889099121094	19
common definitions is action-oriented and focuses on four distinct attributes (Kocka 2003;	70.86000061035156	154.36328125	12.0	453.6072235107422	19
Gosewinkel et al. 2004, 11). These attributes include (1) qualities of self-organization and	70.86001586914062	175.06329345703125	12.0	453.5616149902344	19
independence; (2) an emphasis on actions taken in the public domain nurturing exchange,	70.86004638671875	195.7633056640625	12.0	453.5567626953125	19
discourse, and understanding but also conflict; (3) the acknowledgement that conflicts and	70.86003112792969	216.46331787109375	12.0	453.6264190673828	19
protests are included in this concept of civil society but they are associated with peaceful,	70.86004638671875	237.163330078125	12.0	453.68994140625	19
non-violent, and non-military actions; and (4) a course of action that considers the common	70.86004638671875	257.86334228515625	12.0	453.72845458984375	19
good above and beyond individual, specific, and particular interests.	70.86004638671875	278.5633544921875	12.0	327.72479248046875	19
This paper conceives of civil society in accordance with the logic of this field. As such,	87.84004211425781	299.26336669921875	12.0	436.6919403076172	19
civil society can be perceived especially as characterized by (a) the self-organization of	70.86003112792969	319.96337890625	12.0	453.6443634033203	19
citizens and (b) their voluntary engagement in a number of organizational forms, such as	70.8599853515625	340.66339111328125	12.0	453.60845947265625	19
clubs, associations, initiatives, or foundations. These organizations are generally regarded as	70.8599853515625	361.3634033203125	12.0	453.66485595703125	19
the institutional core or infrastructure of civil society and are often collectively referred to as	70.8599853515625	382.06341552734375	12.0	453.6192626953125	19
the “third” or “nonprofit” sector as a way of separating them from state and market sectors	70.86001586914062	402.763427734375	12.0	453.6036682128906	19
(Anheier et al. 2000). Civil society organizations (CSOs) thus constitute that area of society	70.8599853515625	423.46343994140625	12.0	453.58203125	19
located between the boundaries of market, state, and family, and are characterized by their	70.8599853515625	444.1634521484375	12.0	453.59521484375	19
formal structures, organizational independence from state control, autonomous administration,	70.8599853515625	464.86346435546875	12.0	453.6300048828125	19
non-profit approach, and voluntary engagement. Engagement in civil society organizations	70.8599853515625	485.5634765625	12.0	453.6240234375	19
includes both unpaid voluntary work in traditional membership-based organizations and	70.8599853515625	506.26348876953125	12.0	453.6719970703125	19
nonprofit-oriented activities in unconventional forms of organization.	70.8599853515625	526.9635009765625	12.0	333.6923828125	19
CSOs can be found in a variety of areas and perform diverse roles. Whether in recreational	87.83998107910156	547.6635131835938	12.0	436.6752166748047	19
or cultural spheres, as part of social service facilities, or as other types of local, professional,	70.8599853515625	568.363525390625	12.0	453.6600341796875	19
and political advocacy groups (e.g., clubs, associations, foundations, not-for-profit PLCs,	70.85997009277344	589.0635375976562	12.0	453.67799377441406	19
cooperatives, etc.), they have collectively become an essential part of society’s workings.	70.85995483398438	609.7635498046875	12.0	428.8235778808594	19
As contemporary forms of civic self-organization and self-responsibility, CSOs possesses	87.83993530273438	630.4635009765625	12.0	436.6344299316406	19
considerable abilities with regard to the concentration, expression, and representation of	70.85992431640625	651.1635131835938	12.0	453.62396240234375	19
interests. They are assigned responsibility for implementing important tasks in promoting the	70.85995483398438	671.863525390625	12.0	453.7319641113281	19
development of democracy, providing welfare state services, as well as integrating citizens	70.85995483398438	692.5634765625	12.0	453.6864318847656	19
into coherent collectivities and thereby ensuring social cohesion.	70.85995483398438	713.2634887695312	12.0	310.6440124511719	19
A number of factors have led to the increased importance of this sector of society in recent	87.83995056152344	733.9635009765625	12.0	436.67518615722656	19
years. On the one hand, citizens have progressively taken greater charge of their own skills.	70.85995483398438	754.6635131835938	12.0	453.5615539550781	19
2	87.840003967
On the other hand, social change has led to changes in social roles and functions, resulting in	70.8599853515625	72.7032470703125	12.0	453.567626953125	21
an increasingly stark division of tasks between state, market, and civil society. The growing	70.8599853515625	93.40325927734375	12.0	453.5867919921875	21
significance of CSOs has manifest itself through increases in the number of CSOs, in the	70.86001586914062	114.103271484375	12.0	453.6755676269531	21
number people working in them, and in the services they offer. At the same time, the number	70.86001586914062	134.80328369140625	12.0	453.5687561035156	21
of voluntary workers also continues to grow.	70.86001586914062	155.5032958984375	12.0	214.92355346679688	21
Despite the obvious existence of CSOs and forms of civic engagement, the data available	88.86001586914062	176.20330810546875	12.0	435.6120300292969	21
for this sector remains inadequate. Due to the relatively late development of this social sector	70.86001586914062	196.9033203125	12.0	453.6431579589844	21
as an independent scientific discipline, the empirical information available on this constantly	70.86001586914062	217.60333251953125	12.0	453.6840515136719	21
evolving sector is incomplete. Even official statistics and other data-providing information	70.86004638671875	238.30322265625	12.0001220703125	453.6802978515625	21
systems only mark this area separately to a limited extent, even then not in a consistent	70.86000061035156	259.00323486328125	12.0	453.5580291748047	21
manner. For instance, CSOs and their services are often subsumed within the categories of	70.86000061035156	279.7032470703125	12.0	453.63352966308594	21
state and economy, with data gathered from disparate surveys seldom taking their autonomous	70.8599853515625	300.40325927734375	12.0	453.61553955078125	21
forms of organization into account.	70.85992431640625	321.04327392578125	12.0	169.0295867919922	21
CSOs tend to point out the fact that they break down the classic dichotomy of state and	87.83992004394531	341.7432861328125	12.0	436.64878845214844	21
citizen, replacing it with the three social spheres of state, market, and civil society. In the past,	70.85992431640625	362.44329833984375	12.0	453.62164306640625	21
however, the autonomy of this sector did not prevent the use of CSOs for political ends in	70.85992431640625	383.143310546875	12.0	453.58563232421875	21

to be - responsible. With this in mind, some social actors view CSOs as simply a form of	70.85992431640625	424.5433349609375	12.0	453.5880126953125	21

Generally speaking, the growing demand for data on civil society can be explained by the	87.83992004394531	486.64337158203125	12.0	436.6128387451172	21

Yet the current data situation is extremely complicated, not least because civil society has its	70.85989379882812	528.0433959960938	12.0	453.6528625488281	21

Empirical research on civil society can be divided into investigations aimed at three distinct	70.8599853515625	175.063232421875	12.0	453.622802734375	27
levels. At the macro level, CSOs are collectively analyzed as a field or sector. At the meso	70.8599853515625	195.76324462890625	12.0	453.607177734375	28
level, research focuses on the CSOs, their specific tasks, and the way they function. Finally, at	70.8599853515625	216.4632568359375	12.0	453.7247314453125	29
the micro level, public activity in and for these organizations is investigated, with the key	70.8599853515625	237.16326904296875	12.0	453.58319091796875	30

very basic data have been made available. And yet, it would be possible to draw from these	70.8599853515625	196.9033203125	12.0	453.57965087890625	69
diverse sources - official statistics, information from the CSOs and, above all, data from	70.86001586914062	217.60333251953125	12.0	453.6024475097656	69

improved; this must be set as a goal for the future. Greater coordination will be required in	70.86001586914062	259.00335693359375	12.0	453.5760192871094	69

certain gaps and irregularities. These gaps are caused by a number of factors. On the one	70.8599853515625	617.92333984375	12.0	453.62042236328125	78
hand, transparency is not particularly well developed in civil service organizations; the	70.8599853515625	638.6233520507812	12.0	453.63958740234375	78
corresponding tax legislation means that only limited support is received from the state. On	70.85995483398438	659.3233642578125	12.0	453.6527404785156	78

15,000 German citizens over the age of 14 are queried about their level of civic engagement.	70.8599853515625	474.0433349609375	12.0	453.681640625	83
To date, the survey has been carried out twice - in 1999 and 2004 respectively. The next	70.86000061035156	494.74334716796875	12.0	453.6251678466797	83
survey is planned for 2009. The survey’s data - which have been scientifically verified -	70.86001586914062	515.443359375	12.0	453.5879211425781	83

Research (IAB: Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung). The survey gathers data from	70.85995483398438	210.12957763671875	12.03375244140625	453.6599426269531	89

Therefore, the sample only contains those CSOs with paid staff. The survey thus provides	70.85995483398438	251.5633544921875	12.0	453.6059875488281	89
information relating to staff and the CSOs. However, because it concentrates on economically	70.85995483398438	272.26336669921875	12.0	453.7115783691406	89

The European Social Survey (ESS) is a representative social survey established at the	70.85995483398438	347.6833801269531	12.0	453.6431579589844	91
suggestion of the European Science Foundation (ESF) and carried out for the first time in	70.85995483398438	368.3833923339844	12.0	453.7091979980469	91
2002/2003. In the first round, twenty-two countries participated (Belgium, Denmark,	70.85995483398438	389.0834045410156	12.0	453.6767883300781	91

Czech Republic, and Hungary). With the exception of Switzerland and the Czech Republic,	70.85995483398438	451.1834411621094	12.0	453.6275939941406	91
data on engagement in civil society was provided for the remaining twenty countries. The	70.85997009277344	471.8834533691406	12.0	453.5424346923828	91
long-term goal of the ESS is to investigate the interaction among political and economic	70.8599853515625	492.5834655761719	12.0	453.52325439453125	91
institutions in transition, as well as the attitudes, convictions, and behavioral patterns of each	70.8599853515625	513.283447265625	12.0	453.5904541015625	91
country’s population. The first round focused on the themes, “Citizenship, Involvement,	70.8599853515625	533.9835205078125	12.0	453.55926513671875	91
Democracy.” The 2002/2003 survey uses a four-step approach to gather data on civic	70.8599853515625	554.6834716796875	12.0	453.6695556640625	91
engagement, including: (a) being a member of a CSO, (b) working for a CSO, (c) donation	70.8599853515625	575.383544921875	12.0	453.575927734375	91
behavior, and (d) civic engagement within a CSO. He likens civil society within ten European	70.85995483398438	596.08349609375	12.0	453.6311950683594	91

This portrayal of the current data situation makes it abundantly clear that a comprehensive	70.8599853515625	698.4434814453125	12.0	453.5892333984375	94
and developed information system on civil society simply does not exist at this point. While	70.8599853515625	719.1434936523438	12.0	453.63482666015625	94
individual engagement can be analyzed through different scientific surveys other areas show	70.86000061035156	739.843505859375	12.0	453.7270965576172	94
distinct deficits. Data gaps exist particularly where it concerns CSOs and their concrete fields	70.86000061035156	760.5435180664062	12.0	453.6467742919922	94

14,000 foundations, around 8,000 registered cooperatives, and numerous other organizations -	70.8599853515625	93.40325927734375	12.0	453.664794921875	96
is more than a little hazy. Information on newly established or disbanded CSOs can, as a rule,	70.8599853515625	114.103271484375	12.0	453.6024169921875	96
only be found by searching through special registers existing for different forms of	70.8599853515625	134.80328369140625	12.0	453.58197021484375	96
organizations. One particularly significant gap are broader scientific surveys covering all	70.8599853515625	155.5032958984375	12.0	453.60009765625	96
different organizational forms of CSO.; other countries (e.g., Austria) have already embraced	70.8599853515625	176.20330810546875	12.0	453.62164306640625	96
this approach in recent years as part of their federal statistics. These offer insight into the	70.86000061035156	196.9033203125	12.0	453.67918395996094	96
dynamic changes in the orientation and activities of different CSOs. In view of the increased	70.8599853515625	217.60333251953125	12.0	453.60125732421875	96
economic pressure on organizations, which then tend to react by improving management or	70.8599853515625	238.3033447265625	12.0	453.5806884765625	96
by tapping into additional financial resources (e.g., donations), this has become a necessary	70.8599853515625	259.00335693359375	12.0	453.64556884765625	96
step. This simultaneously raises the question of whether CSOs intend to remain oriented	70.8599853515625	279.703369140625	12.0	453.72607421875	96
toward civil society. A change in this direction could lead CSOs to regard the engagement of	70.8599853515625	300.40338134765625	12.0	453.64080810546875	96
the population in civil society as less important. Economic factors can therefore lead to the	70.86001586914062	321.04339599609375	12.0	453.5987854003906	96
neglect of civic engagement and volunteerism on the part of the CSOs.	70.86001586914062	341.743408203125	12.0	339.892822265625	96
Moreover, irrespective of all that might be done at the organizational level, many	87.84001159667969	362.44342041015625	12.0	436.68128967285156	96
questions that concern the civic engagement sector at the individual level remain unanswered:	70.86001586914062	383.1434326171875	12.0	453.6744079589844	96
either no data are available or existing data cannot come up with adequate answers. As a	70.86001586914062	403.84344482421875	12.0	453.6180114746094	96
consequence, it is almost impossible to analyze whether civic engagement belies an increased	70.86001586914062	424.54345703125	12.0	453.6983947753906	96
tendency towards monetarization. This would confirm theories which talk of increased	70.86000061035156	445.24346923828125	12.0	453.56517028808594	96
tendencies towards a dissolution of boundaries vis-à-vis gainful activity. Research is also	70.86000061035156	465.9434814453125	12.0	453.67918395996094	96
needed to ascertain whether an element of value change is taking place relative to civic	70.8599853515625	486.64349365234375	12.0	453.6431884765625	96
engagement and whether forms of a stronger, non-organized engagement, one which requires	70.8599853515625	507.343505859375	12.0	453.61083984375	96
no concrete membership, are becoming increasingly prevalent.	70.8599853515625	528.0435180664062	12.0	301.2803955078125	96
Alongside these obviously significant gaps in the data, however, some developments and	87.83998107910156	548.7435302734375	12.0	436.58518981933594	96

increase. The long-term task, as it has been in many other areas of society, will be to set up a	70.85992431640625	478.1834411621094	12.0	453.61322021484375	104
meaningful and predominantly self-contained data collection and provision system. This goal	70.85992431640625	498.8834533691406	12.0	453.60235595703125	104
can be reached by using the existing surveys and databases that have been described in this	70.85992431640625	519.58349609375	12.0	453.612060546875	104

by CSOs, or their nonprofit orientation, is considered as a specific criterion throughout. The	70.85992431640625	602.3834838867188	12.0	453.6600341796875	104
basis for subsequent analysis can also be strengthened by integrating questions about civic	70.85992431640625	623.08349609375	12.0	453.60003662109375	104
engagement into other specific large-scale surveys (e.g., the annual microcensus). The	70.85992431640625	643.7235107421875	12.0	453.57476806640625	104
