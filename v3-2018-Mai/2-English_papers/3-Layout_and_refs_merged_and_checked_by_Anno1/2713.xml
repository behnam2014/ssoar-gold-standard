An enlarged EU might be structurally integrated, but the ways in which pre-1989 EU	56.70000076293945	430.9098205566406	12.0	481.8960075378418	6
members used to imagine their counterparts during the Cold War period have profoundly	56.70001220703125	444.7098083496094	12.0	481.8023681640625	6
influenced the ways in which ‘east’ Europe has been and still is thought nowadays (hence	56.70001220703125	458.5097961425781	12.0	481.8887939453125	6
the remaining ideational divergences within a political Europe). The paper argues that	56.70001220703125	472.3097839355469	12.0	481.921142578125	6
European construction and pos-1989 enlargement of the EU towards East imply a form of	56.700042724609375	486.1097717285156	12.0	481.8995666503906	6
subtle and untold domination of the Western part of the continent subtlety and at times	56.700042724609375	499.9097595214844	12.0	481.8361511230469	6
unconsciously by institutions of the EU or by academic discourses on Central and Eastern	56.700042724609375	513.709716796875	12.0	481.9032287597656	6
Europe. Such domination, as an unintended consequence, is best explored on the	56.700042724609375	527.509765625	12.0	481.9199523925781	6
ideational level and through the central role that 1989 has taken in this process.	56.700042724609375	541.3096923828125	12.0	481.8360290527344	6
Discussing slope-metaphors and allochronisms in the field of a European common	56.700042724609375	555.1097412109375	12.0	481.8828430175781	6
memory, this paper shows how artificial distances are created between Eastern and	56.700042724609375	568.90966796875	12.0	481.9020080566406	6
Western Europe. By combining allochronism and heteronomy, we have coined the new	56.700042724609375	582.709716796875	12.0	481.8912048339844	6
term of ‘heterochrony’ to express the situation in which a given group does not have the	56.700042724609375	596.5097045898438	12.0	481.8167419433594	6
capacity of choosing its own laws and the cognitive means to think of itself and where such	56.700042724609375	610.3096923828125	12.0	481.9393005371094	6
situation is due to reasons of different time location (in that case in a backward situation)	56.700042724609375	624.1097412109375	12.0	481.8863830566406	6
than other autonomous groups. Such heterochrony might lead to a halt of transnational	56.700042724609375	637.9097290039062	12.0	481.8971862792969	6

1. Introduction: Othering process, cognitive means and time.	56.70000076293945	85.3587646484375	12.0	346.77717208862305	10
We will discuss in this paper the view that the enlarged European Union we now live in and	92.0999984741211	122.26336669921875	12.0	446.5920181274414	11
which we intellectually perceive is as much the direct result of 1989 than it is of the efforts to create	56.70001220703125	136.0633544921875	12.0	481.99920654296875	11
the first European Communities in the 1950s. The breaking apart of the Communist block ushered	56.700042724609375	149.86334228515625	12.0	481.9391784667969	11
in a new era for a political Europe where positive features (EU enlargement commenced in 1995 by	56.700042724609375	163.663330078125	12.0	481.9200134277344	11
incorporating the hitherto ‘neutral’ states of Austria, Finland and Sweden, not to mention the 2004	56.7000732421875	177.46331787109375	12.0	481.9176025390625	11
and 2007 enlargements) coexist with more problematic ones (unsolved security agreements between	56.7000732421875	191.2633056640625	12.0	481.99798583984375	11
the EU and Russia, some occidentalist reductionist ways of describing Eastern Europe in urgent	56.7000732421875	205.0032958984375	12.0	481.926025390625	11
need to catch up with (Western) Europe, or the stumbling bocks still existing between East and	56.7000732421875	218.80328369140625	12.0	481.9608154296875	11
West on the debate of a common European memory). One could say that 1989 ‘made’ Europe, but	56.7000732421875	232.603271484375	12.0	481.94403076171875	11
in an imperfect manner. So, what has been the impact of European integration on 1989? Prior	56.7000732421875	246.40325927734375	12.0	481.9571533203125	11
western European integration facilitated and legitimated, it may be surmised, the notion of a ‘return	56.7000732421875	260.2032470703125	12.0	481.9896240234375	11
to Europe’ voiced by the dissidents and revolutionaries in the Soviet bloc as well as the	56.700042724609375	274.00323486328125	12.0	482.0447692871094	11
Gorbachevian notion of a Common European Home. Yet, how was the transformation of Europe	56.700042724609375	287.80322265625	12.0	481.9367980957031	11
after 1989 constrained and enabled by the pre-existence of a common western political project?	56.700042724609375	301.60321044921875	12.0	458.1636047363281	11
1989 ‘made’ Europe because what was hitherto a divided continent now became united.	92.0999984741211	329.203369140625	11.999969482421875	446.56803131103516	12
More specifically, the revolutions of 1989 brought in their wake German unity. Negotiations	56.69999694824219	343.0033264160156	12.0	481.94398498535156	12
regarding German unification and the integration of this new Germany into western structures were	56.699981689453125	356.8033142089844	12.0	481.9787902832031	12
to change fundamentally the reality and the idea of Europe. One could say that Germany epitomizes	56.699981689453125	370.6033020019531	12.0	481.9427795410156	12
the problem of an enlarged Europe Union to 27 members: by incorporating the eastern part into the	56.699981689453125	384.36956787109375	12.033721923828125	481.9416198730469	12
western part of the FRG, the historical experience and identity of the GDR tended to be written off	56.70001220703125	398.1695556640625	12.033721923828125	481.93072509765625	12
and to disappear (and quite symptomatically, they are dubbed the ‘new’ Länder so as to insist that	56.70001220703125	411.96954345703125	12.033721923828125	481.95587158203125	12
things had be started anew there) based on the assumption that they had little, or simply nothing to	56.70001220703125	425.8032531738281	12.0	481.9151611328125	12
offer to the western experience or ways of doing politics and of imagining itself.	56.70002746582031	439.6032409667969	12.0	385.8996124267578	12
We will argue that a same phenomenon has happened between EU15 (western Europe) and	92.0999984741211	467.2033386230469	12.0	446.57279205322266	13
the new 12 EU member states: 15+12 may have created an enlarged EU that is now indeed	56.699981689453125	481.0033264160156	12.0	481.9559631347656	13
structurally integrated (or in the continuous process of complete integration), but the ways in which	56.70001220703125	494.8033142089844	12.0	481.9307861328125	13
EU15/West Germany used to imagine their/its counterpart(s) during the Cold War period have	56.70001220703125	508.603271484375	12.0	481.9332275390625	13
profoundly influenced the ways in which ‘east’ Europe has been and still is thought nowadays	56.70001220703125	522.4033203125	12.0	481.87451171875	13
(hence the ideational divergences that this conference tries to tackle). Put differently, the process of	56.70001220703125	536.2032470703125	12.0	481.936767578125	13
ideational convergence that EU enlargement should have carried through and fulfilled in the period	56.70001220703125	550.0032958984375	12.0	481.9332275390625	13
1989-2004 was profoundly and negatively affected by an occidentalist bias in which the	56.70001220703125	563.80322265625	12.0	481.96673583984375	13
GDR/Eastern Europe was thought not on the basis of its own merit, features or characteristics but as	56.70001220703125	577.603271484375	11.999984741210938	482.04608154296875	13
the negative Other of an integrating Western Europe. ‘Othering’ mechanisms most frequently	56.700042724609375	591.4032592773438	12.0	481.9103698730469	13
contribute to simplifications and negative stereotypes, and this paper will discuss some of these	56.700042724609375	605.2032470703125	12.0	481.9056091308594	13
mechanisms and their consequences in the power relation between eastern and western Europe. Of	56.700042724609375	619.0032958984375	12.0	482.0280456542969	13
interest for us here will be the case of collective memory around European themes, political	56.700042724609375	632.8032836914062	12.0	481.8492126464844	13
contributions to a European acquis and questions of collective autonomy, and how 1989 has been a	56.700042724609375	646.603271484375	12.0	481.9512023925781	13
turning point in such problematic mutual perceptions between Eastern and Western Europe. The	56.700042724609375	660.4032592773438	12.0	481.8636169433594	13
paper will not discuss the institutional arrangements of post-1989 EU life but dwells at length on	56.700042724609375	674.2032470703125	12.0	481.9332580566406	13
ideational and cognitive issues for two reasons. One because ‘Europe’ (as a political project) needs	56.7000732421875	688.0032958984375	12.0	482.0340576171875	13
to rethink itself if it wants to be more inclusive and more democracy-friendly (the self-reflective	56.7000732421875	701.8032836914062	12.0	482.07366943359375	13
dimension of Europe). Second, because for individuals and state to feel as fully equals within the	56.7000732421875	715.603271484375	12.0	481.93798828125	13
3	5
European realms need not just to have the same access to EU institutions but should also have equal	56.70000076293945	72.76336669921875	12.0	481.85883712768555	15
access to cognitive means1 (the capacity of auto-institution on the cognitive level).	56.70001220703125	84.12408447265625	14.43927001953125	396.9912109375	15
Of central concern in this paper is the study of certain discourses articulated around deep	92.0999984741211	114.163330078125	12.0	446.50077056884766	16
differences between East/West and favoring dichotomous understanding of Europe. We will try to	56.699981689453125	127.96331787109375	12.0	481.8708190917969	16
understand why such discourses occur, what are their meanings and discuss some of their examples,	56.699981689453125	141.7633056640625	12.0	481.9643249511719	16
a famous illustration being that of Norman Davies when he dissects the division ‘East and West	56.699981689453125	155.56329345703125	12.0	481.8780822753906	16
Europe’. In that perspective (and in his critique the occidentalistic-cum-orientalistic framework)	56.699981689453125	169.36328125	12.0	481.9799499511719	16
Norman Davies shows how the famous curriculum course on ‘Western Civilisation’ introduces	56.699981689453125	183.16326904296875	12.0	481.9631652832031	16
sloppy reasoning and judgemental dualisms of the following kind:	56.699981689453125	196.90325927734375	12.0	318.0600280761719	16
1. That the western and eastern halves of Europe are separate entities with little or nothing in	56.70000076293945	210.703369140625	12.0	481.94880294799805	16
common.	74.70001220703125	224.50335693359375	12.0	44.95680236816406	16
2. That Eastern Europe is not really part of Europe, or not part of ‘the real Europe’.	56.70000076293945	238.3033447265625	12.0	404.8907890319824	16
3. That the East-West division of Europe, which can be observed in different manifestations at	56.70000076293945	252.10333251953125	12.0	481.96552658081055	16
different times, is fixed and permanent.	74.69998168945312	265.9033203125	12.0	188.97601318359375	16
4. That ‘the West’ is superior.	56.70000076293945	279.703369140625	12.0	149.66518783569336	16
5. That all summaries of Western civilisation / European history can safely omit anything which	56.70000076293945	293.50335693359375	12.0	482.0627555847168	16
belongs to the different and inferior East. (The only exception to this rule is Russia, which,	74.69999694824219	307.3033447265625	12.0	463.9210968017578	16
being powerful, automatically qualifies for inclusion.) (Davies 2006: 60).	74.69998168945312	321.10333251953125	12.0	352.2960205078125	16
This type of idea is also somehow embedded in much of the political science literature dealing with	56.70000076293945	334.9033508300781	12.0	481.9859733581543	16
democratization and civil society promotion. There, one can find similar biases simply in the fact	56.70001220703125	348.7033386230469	12.0	481.8624267578125	16
that ‘transition’ has to be managed from outside by western donors (instead of counting on local	56.70001220703125	362.5033264160156	12.0	481.9295654296875	16
forces), or that civil society often has to be constructed and engineered into the right type of	56.70001220703125	376.3033142089844	12.0	481.92120361328125	16
political participation (rather than leaving the existing institution choosing their own course of	56.700042724609375	390.1033020019531	12.0	481.9127502441406	16
action and rhetoric to do so).2	56.700042724609375	401.4641418457031	14.43914794921875	142.46995544433594	16
Attila Melegh, in a recent stimulant book, questions also such dualisms and argues that an	95.09639739990234	431.50335693359375	12.0	443.6364517211914	17
East-West slope runs across the self-perception of Europe. This slope implies a sense of normative	56.70001220703125	445.3033447265625	12.0	481.9332275390625	17
judgment where the west is the positive endpoint of the slope (embodied by a liberal humanitarian	56.70001220703125	459.10333251953125	12.0	481.9320068359375	17

rather how these ‘East-West slopes’ based on the idea of diminishing civilization toward the ‘East’	56.699981689453125	541.9031982421875	12.0	481.9427795410156	17

1 I draw here inspiration on the work of Castoriadis for whom autonomy is not just a political autonomy a la Rousseau,	56.70000076293945	701.713623046875	11.807113647460938	475.5608024597168	19
but also the capacity to choose its cognitive means to do so (Castoriadis 1986, 1997 and 1999). We will develop later	56.70355224609375	715.0237426757812	10.019996643066406	468.97222900390625	19
this point in the part dealing with heterochrony. See in particular Section 3.b.	56.70355224609375	726.4866333007812	10.019996643066406	308.7442932128906	19

enough local resources and that has negative social effects, see, e.g., Hann & Dunn (1997) and Mendelson (2002).	56.70353698730469	749.5237426757812	10.019996643066406	459.32557678222656	19

discourses on Central and Eastern Europe. Such domination, bordering at times with coloniality4 as	56.70001220703125	84.12408447265625	14.43927001953125	481.907958984375	21
an unintended consequence, is best explored on the ideational level and through the central role that	56.699951171875	100.36334228515625	12.0	481.96075439453125	21
1989 has taken in this process. That there was a relation of power between the EU and (soon to be)	56.699920654296875	114.163330078125	12.0	481.8971862792969	21
candidate Eastern European states in the period 1989-2004 is out of doubt (one just needs to think	56.699920654296875	127.96331787109375	12.0	481.9319763183594	21
of the Copenhagen criteria to respect in order to become part of the club). The sub-hypotheses we	56.699920654296875	141.7633056640625	12.0	481.7736511230469	21
are exploring here is that domination is not a conscious fact but a consequence of institutional	56.699920654296875	155.529541015625	12.03375244140625	481.8887634277344	21
practices rooted in a European community born during the Cold War and of certain academic	56.699951171875	169.36328125	12.0	481.870849609375	21
devices reinforcing divides between social groups (in our case, the ‘east’ and the ‘west’). In this	56.699951171875	183.16326904296875	12.0	481.9176025390625	21
process, 1989 plaid a particular role by leaving a lasting imprint on official discourses on Eastern	56.699951171875	196.90325927734375	12.0	481.9151611328125	21
Europe and influenced by a reading of Communism having atomized and destroyed all positive	56.699951171875	210.7032470703125	12.0	481.88397216796875	21
constitutive elements in Eastern Europe that had no other issue but to catch up and emulate the	56.699951171875	224.50323486328125	12.0	481.9344482421875	21
western ways of doing.	56.699951171875	238.30322265625	12.0	111.31199645996094	21
Such view can be found elsewhere nowadays in some of the debates about a European	92.09989929199219	265.9033203125	12.0	446.5847930908203	22
memory and historical representation of Europe. To advance a metaphor, we could say that on the	56.699859619140625	279.70330810546875	12.0	481.8407897949219	22
theme of European memory and identity, there is a sort of East-West slope running across the	56.69989013671875	293.5032958984375	12.0	481.99676513671875	22
continent where, e.g. Eastern Europe still needs to come to term with the Holocaust and still needs	56.69989013671875	307.30328369140625	12.0	481.95599365234375	22
to do some work on its collective history with regard to the extermination of Jews.5 We argue that	56.69989013671875	318.66412353515625	14.439239501953125	481.95611572265625	22
there is a slope here as well, because differences in the Vergangenheitsbewältigungen tend to be	56.70001220703125	334.86962890625	12.033721923828125	481.83843994140625	22
expressed not only in normative term (‘they must come to term with this problem’, or ‘they have	56.70001220703125	348.7033386230469	12.0	481.86956787109375	22
not done their homework’, etc.), but also in terms of different time locations (‘they are trailing back	56.70001220703125	362.5033264160156	12.0	481.968017578125	22
on the work on memory, etc). Johannes Fabian, in his important albeit little quoted work on Time	56.70001220703125	376.26959228515625	12.033721923828125	481.93682861328125	22
and the Other (1983), underlines that one of the favorite ways for anthropology to ‘make its	56.700042724609375	390.069580078125	12.033721923828125	481.9980773925781	22
objects’ is through time and what he terms ‘denial of coevalness’ (Fabian 1983: 32) or	56.7000732421875	403.9032897949219	12.0	481.89111328125	22
‘allochronism’ (from the Greek ‘allos’ for ‘other, and ‘xronos’ for time). Allochronism could be	56.70008850097656	417.7032775878906	12.0	481.93919372558594	22
defined as the (usually forced) positioning of one’s group in a different time than that of the	56.7000732421875	431.5032653808594	12.0	481.9031982421875	22
reference group. His thesis is that “anthropology has emerged and established itself as an	56.7000732421875	445.3032531738281	12.0	481.8624267578125	22
allochronic discourse; it is a science of other men in another Time. It is a discourse whose referent	56.7000732421875	459.06951904296875	12.033721923828125	481.91046142578125	22
has been removed from the present of the speaking/writing subject” (ibid.: 143).	56.7000732421875	472.9032287597656	12.0	384.9527893066406	22
Although Fabian criticizes the discipline of anthropology (for its contribution to the	92.0999984741211	500.50335693359375	12.0	446.42996978759766	23
realization of colonialism), his arguments runs parallel to that of Melegh, when the former sustains	56.699981689453125	514.3033447265625	12.0	481.9608459472656	23
that anthropology “promoted a scheme in terms of which not only past cultures, but all living	56.699981689453125	528.1033325195312	12.0	481.9620056152344	23
societies were irrevocably placed on a temporal slope, a stream of Time—some upstream, others	56.699981689453125	541.9033203125	12.0	481.9200744628906	23
downstream. Civilization, evolution, development, acculturation, modernization (and their cousins,	56.699981689453125	555.7033081054688	12.0	481.9476013183594	23
industrialization, urbanization) are all terms whose conceptual content devices, in ways that can be	56.699981689453125	569.5032958984375	12.0	481.8792419433594	23
specified, from evolutionary time” (Fabian 1983: 17). The problem with such allochronism and	56.70001220703125	583.3032836914062	11.999984741210938	481.98968505859375	23
slope-metaphor is not that they ascribe people definitively to a certain place, or position on the scale	56.70001220703125	597.103271484375	12.0	482.0831298828125	23
of civilization or of Erinnerungsarbeit, but that they create artificial distances between different	56.70001220703125	610.8695678710938	12.03375244140625	481.95721435546875	23
groups and that they ‘otherize’ given social groups. They put certain groups in a more active (the	56.70001220703125	624.7033081054688	12.0	481.91278076171875	23
one judging the time location and deciding of the allochronism) or passive stance (the group lagging	56.70001220703125	638.5032958984375	12.0	481.88885498046875	23
behind6). The negative results for the group at a lower end of such othering process and delineation	56.70001220703125	649.8641357421875	14.439208984375	481.9896240234375	23
4 Melegh defines colonialty as “a system of power understood as a complex form of domination, including the	56.70000076293945	678.7335205078125	11.807113647460938	441.05488204956055	24
hierarchical classification of the populations of the planet, the reformulation of local concepts of space and time, the	56.70353698730469	691.9835205078125	10.020004272460938	464.46205139160156	24
export of sexual energies into the ‘East’, the ‘imperial gaze’ and most importantly the colonization of consciousness.	56.6934814453125	703.4783935546875	10.048080444335938	466.541259765625	24
The latter point can be summed up as ‘an energy and a machinery to transform differences into values’ and as the	56.6934814453125	715.0294799804688	10.019996643066406	453.7057189941406	24
consequence ‘subalternization of knowledge and societies” (Melegh 2006: 29. His emphasis).	56.69349670410156	726.4923706054688	10.019996643066406	374.95945739746094	24
5 See Troebst’s seminal papers (2005, 2006 and 2007) on that matter.	56.70000076293945	736.2136840820312	11.807044982910156	276.77094650268555	24
6 Todorova (2005: 163f) also uses the concept of allochronism with regard to a certain analysis of the temporalities of	56.70000076293945	747.7337036132812	11.807044982910156	470.71723556518555	24

process between active/passive, modern/traditional is first that, as Melegh argues, it affects the self-	56.70000076293945	72.76336669921875	12.0	482.0472526550293	26
understanding of such people leading to discriminatory or racist views, and second that it	56.70000076293945	86.5633544921875	12.0	481.92963790893555	26
disempowers them putting them in a situation of heteronomy7. By combining allochronism and	56.70001220703125	97.924072265625	14.43927001953125	481.9295654296875	26
heteronomy, we have coined the new term of ‘heterochrony’ to express the situation in which a	56.70001220703125	114.163330078125	12.0	481.9608154296875	26
given group does not have the capacity of choosing its own laws and the cognitive means to think	56.70001220703125	127.9295654296875	12.03375244140625	481.96917724609375	26
of itself and where such situation is due to reasons of different time location (in that case in a	56.70001220703125	141.7633056640625	12.0	481.97998046875	26
backward situation) than other autonomous groups. Let us see now how such theme can be found in	56.70001220703125	155.56329345703125	12.0	481.92474365234375	26
the post-1989 phase, how this has become an institutional problem and how it relates to the question	56.70001220703125	169.36328125	12.0	481.82891845703125	26
of European memory.	56.70001220703125	183.16326904296875	12.0	105.00001525878906	26

If there was an impact of 1989 on European ‘integration’8, there is probably also some	92.0999984741211	250.86407470703125	14.43927001953125	446.44559478759766	28
reflections to gain from the following reversed question: What has been the impact of European	56.699981689453125	267.10321044921875	12.0	481.9967956542969	28
integration on 1989? In other words, has the transformation of a post-1989 eastern Europe been	56.699981689453125	280.86944580078125	12.03375244140625	481.9223937988281	28
constrained by the pre-existence of a common western political project, west of the Iron Curtain? If	56.699981689453125	294.66943359375	12.03375244140625	481.9440002441406	28
so, how? To give short answers to this question, we will resort to three sub-questions.	56.699981689453125	308.503173828125	12.0	410.98443603515625	28
The first question: Has there been an impact of 1989 on European Integration? If so, of	92.0999984741211	336.06951904296875	12.033721923828125	446.5152359008789	29
what kind? This is well beyond the scope of this paper, and 1989 surely had a variety of impacts on	56.70001220703125	349.8695068359375	12.033721923828125	481.91278076171875	29
European integration and European societies at large. A short answer, easier to give now that the	56.70001220703125	363.7032165527344	12.0	481.97283935546875	29
2004 and 2007 enlargements took place is that the collapse of Iron Curtain has allowed the entry of	56.70001220703125	377.5032043457031	12.0	481.8887939453125	29
former communist as well as some neutral countries into the EEC/EU. 1989 has, in a way, given a	56.70001220703125	391.3031921386719	12.0	481.82525634765625	29
new impetus towards a revamped and enlarged common ‘European House’ (to take the phrase of	56.70001220703125	405.1031799316406	12.0	481.99200439453125	29
Gorbatchov). But why was it that ‘Europe’ became the roof for integration of a post-1989 eastern	56.70001220703125	418.9031677246094	12.0	481.93804931640625	29
Europe? This leads us to the second question.	56.70001220703125	432.7031555175781	12.0	218.63882446289062	29
What has been the impact of European integration on 1989? The response, though	92.0999984741211	460.26953125	12.033721923828125	446.5475845336914	30
seemingly tautological, is simply another wave of ‘European integration’, yet of another kind. Since	56.69999694824219	474.1032409667969	12.0	481.98841857910156	30
the EEC was one of the most effective supra-national political institutions at the time of the collapse	56.70001220703125	487.9032287597656	12.0	482.0892333984375	30
of the Soviet empire, the model of European integration provided a direct blueprint or a clear	56.70001220703125	501.7032470703125	12.0	481.96795654296875	30
horizon for eastern Europe (hence the (problematic) notion shared by many that there was a ‘return	56.70001220703125	515.503173828125	12.0	481.92120361328125	30
to Europe’). The process is what is referred to in neo-institutionalist parlance as a case of path-	56.70001220703125	529.30322265625	12.0	481.87799072265625	30
dependency. Once the project of an effective European community was re-launched in the 1980s	56.70001220703125	543.1031494140625	12.0	481.888671875	30
and that political momentum was given towards further integration by the 1987 Single Act, the	56.70001220703125	556.9031982421875	12.0	481.96319580078125	30
existing and already expanding European institution was the natural candidate at the time of the	56.70001220703125	570.66943359375	12.03369140625	482.04718017578125	30
Soviet collapse to preside over renewed collaboration between East and West. Other ‘pan-	56.70001220703125	584.503173828125	11.999984741210938	481.9007568359375	30
European’ institutions existed and mattered already back then, like NATO, Conference for Security	56.69999694824219	598.3031616210938	12.0	482.03993225097656	30
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the Council of Europe, but since the post-1989 task	56.699981689453125	612.1031494140625	12.0	481.9607849121094	30
included also the question of German re-unification (a still very sour point to many European states	56.699981689453125	625.9031982421875	12.0	481.9488220214844	30
back in 1989, and an issue that had driven a decisive wedge in the East-West relationship in the	56.699981689453125	639.7031860351562	12.0	482.0196228027344	30
7 To define heteronomy, we will tap again into the work of Castoriadis. Autonomy, as pointed earlier, is the capacity to	56.70000076293945	667.213623046875	11.807113647460938	476.5146598815918	31
choose its own laws and the cognitive means to do so. An autonomous society is one that has the capacity of auto-	56.703521728515625	680.5237426757812	10.020004272460938	457.3791198730469	31
institution, that is the capacity for societies to openly ‘call into question their own institution, their representation of the	56.703521728515625	691.95849609375	10.048080444335938	477.1826477050781	31
world, their social imaginary significations’ (Castoriadis 1997: 17).	56.703521728515625	703.5095825195312	10.020004272460938	269.7835388183594	31
In an heteronymous society, there is no capacity to choose its laws and/or there is closure on the cognitive level. By	56.699501037597656	715.0206298828125	10.019996643066406	463.0112533569336	31
closure Castoriadis means that a given society does not have the possibilities to choose the ways and means in which	56.699493408203125	726.4835205078125	10.019996643066406	467.4339294433594	31
they reflect about themselves. Closure implies the law of others imposed on this society.	56.699493408203125	738.0065307617188	10.019996643066406	353.4806823730469	31
8 The term ‘integration’ would be discussing since it is highly contentious. For a discussion of the term ‘integration’ see	56.70000076293945	747.7337036132812	11.807044982910156	479.55390548706055	31
the work on US-influence on the first steps of European construction in Winand (1993) and Aldrich (1997).	56.70353698730469	760.983642578125	10.019996643066406	430.7098846435547	31

nascent cold war in the late 1940s), the issue of East-West unification had to be subordinated to a	56.70000076293945	72.7296142578125	12.03375244140625	481.98957443237305	33
political forum with binding supra-national powers and in which the USA could have a say.9 NATO	56.699981689453125	84.12408447265625	14.43927001953125	481.9248352050781	33
could not be such a forum (because of its military nature and the reluctance of the Soviet Union/CIS	56.70001220703125	100.36334228515625	12.0	482.02435302734375	33
to abandon all of its sphere of influence—although NATO was also part of the discussion back in	56.699951171875	114.163330078125	12.0	481.9031982421875	33
1989, as much as it is still part of the problem in Europe now if one just looks at the stand off	56.699951171875	127.96331787109375	12.0	481.963134765625	33
between Russia and Europe on the question of Georgia this Summer), while the Council of Europe	56.699951171875	141.7633056640625	12.0	481.88397216796875	33
and the CSCE (transformed in 1994 into the OSCE) were only too loose inter-governmental	56.699951171875	155.56329345703125	12.0	481.96319580078125	33
institutions to be able to decide on such important matters. Moreover, as observes Delcour (2008),	56.699920654296875	169.36328125	12.0	481.9200134277344	33
by the time of the Wall collapse, the EEC was already engaged in managing a flow of aid to Poland	56.699920654296875	183.16326904296875	12.0	481.8935852050781	33
and Hungary and therefore the EEC was the natural candidate to cope with the task of helping	56.699920654296875	196.90325927734375	12.0	481.9596252441406	33
Eastern Europe out of planed economy and of bureaucratic dictatorships.	56.699920654296875	210.7032470703125	12.0	349.7784118652344	33
Why would path-dependency be important in this phase of transition? Because institutions	92.0999984741211	238.3033447265625	12.0	446.6064224243164	34
(such as that of the EEC and EU) have their development constrained by past learning processes	56.70001220703125	252.10333251953125	12.0	481.884033203125	34
and organizational memories rather than by totally new external impetuses.10 In our case, the	56.70001220703125	263.464111328125	14.439208984375	481.8912353515625	34
institutional lasting imprint we will look is that of the cold war vision of Eastern Europe (See	56.699981689453125	279.70330810546875	12.0	481.9992370605469	34
Illutration 2 below) that had been totally destroyed by the Soviet domination and which was	56.699981689453125	293.5032958984375	12.0	481.8527526855469	34
therefore to be rebuild and reconstruct from scratch.11 The EEC (soon to become EU) which was	56.699981689453125	304.86407470703125	14.43927001953125	481.8780822753906	34
well active by 1989 as an inter-governmental forum, and which in part had just started working with	56.70001220703125	321.10333251953125	12.0	481.84088134765625	34
some Central European countries, was therefore the natural candidate to oversee the re-birth of	56.70001220703125	334.9033203125	12.0	481.94281005859375	34
‘Europe’, east and west alike, launching a new phase of European integration. This leads us to the	56.70001220703125	348.70330810546875	12.0	481.94403076171875	34
third level of questioning, which has to do with the nature of ‘Europe’, as a political project, and the	56.70001220703125	362.5032958984375	12.0	481.93804931640625	34
consequences of this dominant position acquired in 1989 by ‘Europe’ which was born out of the	56.70001220703125	376.30328369140625	12.0	481.96197509765625	34
western European experience of integration.	56.70001220703125	390.103271484375	12.0	212.3135986328125	34
What has been the impact of a pre-existent integrated political western Europe for eastern	92.0999984741211	417.7296142578125	12.0	446.47684478759766	35
Europe? ‘Europe’, as a political project born of the creation of the first communities in the 1950s	56.70001220703125	431.4696044921875	12.033721923828125	481.92242431640625	35
(European Coal and Steel Community, European Economic Community, EURATOM) was not a	56.700042724609375	445.3033142089844	12.0	482.0039978027344	35
‘neutral’ or ‘technocratic’ project, but was clearly a political project favoured and largely funded by	56.700042724609375	459.1033020019531	12.0	481.9367980957031	35
the USA in the immediate post-WW2 period (Aldrich 1997). If one wants therefore to understand	56.700042724609375	472.9032897949219	12.0	481.9607849121094	35
what has been the impact of a pre-existent political Europe (EEC) on the post-1989 Europe, one has	56.700042724609375	486.7032775878906	12.0	481.9668273925781	35
to understand not only the EEC in the 1980s but also the origins of this political Europe, for it	56.700042724609375	500.5032958984375	12.0	481.9008483886719	35
carries in seeds certain traits of the 1950s that might be (or have been) detrimental towards eastern	56.7000732421875	514.30322265625	12.0	481.92718505859375	35
Europe four or five decades later. It is thus important to understand the biases that ‘Europe’ has	56.7000732421875	528.0695190429688	12.03375244140625	481.884033203125	35
both for eastern Europe and for Europe as a geographical entity. It is puzzling to note, first of all,	56.7000732421875	541.9031982421875	12.0	482.038818359375	35
how the term “Europe” is now widely referred to as a short cut for a political Europe embodied now	56.7000732421875	555.6694946289062	12.03375244140625	481.9871826171875	35
by the EU, yet, when one opens a history book on Europe, very little will be said about this political	56.700042724609375	569.503173828125	12.0	481.9488220214844	35
Europe, or that it is not so well ‘integrated’ with the history of European states (just to take two	56.700042724609375	583.30322265625	11.999984741210938	481.9980163574219	35
9 On how the USA’s influence over Europe gradually vanished from the 1980s onwards, see Lundestad (2003).	56.70000076293945	632.713623046875	11.807113647460938	444.96979904174805	36
10 On path-dependency and neo-institutionalism in general, see DiMaggio & Powell (1991: in particular pp. 192ff).	56.70000076293945	644.233642578125	11.807113647460938	460.2326774597168	36
11 One could argue that path-dependency is also important here because the nature of European construction has been to	56.70000076293945	655.6937255859375	11.806991577148438	479.72163009643555	36
turn its back to a past of national antagonism and enmity (e.g. France vs Germany) and to construct a positive	56.69708251953125	669.0037231445312	10.020004272460938	438.6404724121094	36
collaborative project instead. The period 1989-1991 is another moment where Europe is reluctant to look at a certain	56.69708251953125	680.5267333984375	10.020004272460938	466.7247314453125	36
past of rather unorthodox cooperation in the field of military cooperation in the shadow of the NATO and of unpleasant	56.69708251953125	691.9896240234375	10.020004272460938	478.5162353515625	36
alliances and flirts with extreme right-wing groups in Western Europe. The so-called GLADIO network of stay-behind	56.687042236328125	703.5125732421875	10.020004272460938	475.4970397949219	36
armies in case of Soviet invasion was behind the strategy of tension by western European governments in the 1960s and	56.687042236328125	715.0355834960938	10.019996643066406	480.2154235839844	36
1970s. Ganser (2005) discusses at length these networks. It is interesting to see that these were partly made public	56.687042236328125	726.4984741210938	10.019996643066406	455.9111633300781	36
around 1990 and 1991, but passed the Fall 1991, all European governments then refused to participate and comment on	56.687042236328125	738.021484375	10.019996643066406	477.6996765136719	36
their existence. Can this be another impact of 1989, namely a sort of Flucht nach vorn to avoid to deal with western	56.687042236328125	749.5162963867188	10.048194885253906	463.0623474121094	36
European sore experience and concentrate on enlargement instead?	56.68701171875	761.0073852539062	10.019996643066406	268.4488220214844	36
7	532.55999
examples, we can quote the work of Tony Judt (2005)12 or Harold James (2003), where the question	56.70000076293945	70.3240966796875	14.43927001953125	481.87202072143555	38
of European integration occupies only a tiny portion of their influential works on Europe taken as a	56.70001220703125	86.5633544921875	12.0	481.99200439453125	38
geographical aggregation of nation-states). So there is a discrepancy between the avowed goal of a	56.70001220703125	100.36334228515625	12.0	481.9908447265625	38
political Europe to represent an integrated physical Europe in general and the place granted to this	56.70001220703125	114.163330078125	12.0	481.90570068359375	38
political project in historical works (and probably in the mind of most Europeans). This discrepancy	56.70001220703125	127.96331787109375	12.0	481.8887939453125	38
is nonetheless interesting for us because it indicates that the political project of ‘Europe’ has been	56.70001220703125	141.7633056640625	12.0	481.87445068359375	38
trying to project the idea of a common European fate as a basis for a full integration.13 It is this	56.70001220703125	153.12408447265625	14.43927001953125	481.95123291015625	38
project, that one could qualify as hegemonic since it tends to erase other narratives and tends	56.70001220703125	169.36334228515625	12.0	481.9200439453125	38
towards its own satisfaction via diverse institutional means. ‘Europe’ disposes of many ways and	56.70001220703125	183.163330078125	12.0	481.94036865234375	38
institutions through which it can diffuse its visions of ‘Europe’. These institutions take various	56.70001220703125	196.9033203125	12.0	481.9307861328125	38

The surge of such literature on a ‘cultural’ Europe is one manifestation of a rather recent	92.0999984741211	307.3033447265625	12.0	446.44193267822266	39
way of conceiving of ‘Europe’ as a place allegedly sharing a same cultural stratum.15 If we take the	56.69999694824219	318.66412353515625	14.439239501953125	481.90797424316406	39
representation of European construction in a selection of European textbooks, we can see that there	56.699981689453125	334.9033508300781	12.0	481.9512023925781	39
is a Europeanisation of the historical representation of ‘Europe’. By Europeanisation, we mean that	56.70001220703125	348.7033386230469	12.0	481.9307861328125	39
we are not only witnessing the drafting of a common supra-national curriculum around Europe and	56.70001220703125	362.5033264160156	12.0	482.023193359375	39

(Challand 2009). 1989 is presented as an important unfolding moment for ‘Europe’ since it offered	56.70001220703125	417.70330810546875	12.0	481.9151611328125	39

15 I am grateful to Chris Amrbruster for observing that this literature on a cultural Europe is also an effect of 1989 and	56.70000076293945	699.4337158203125	11.806991577148438	474.5715446472168	41
the ‘return to Europe’. The cultural claim to Europe could be made most easily from CEE on the basis of religion, art,	56.69706726074219	712.68359375	10.019996643066406	471.1253204345703	41

Projecting the integration of Europe on the basis of a common fate (and we touch here on	92.0999984741211	112.36334228515625	12.0	446.51761627197266	50

First, in this vision of an always expanding (western) political Europe, it is as though eastern	92.09519958496094	182.5633544921875	12.0	446.48280334472656	52
Europe does not have anything to offer to European integration. In the three questions I have raised	56.699981689453125	196.36334228515625	12.0	481.9691467285156	52
above, it is as though eastern Europe was the land of emptiness, with no wealth, knowledge,	56.69996643066406	210.163330078125	12.0	481.92002868652344	52
institutions, or history upon which a post-1989 Europe could draw resources, only the passive	56.699951171875	223.9033203125	12.0	481.9307861328125	52
receptacles of information, good practices and projects to be funded by Brussels (Illustration 1	56.699951171875	237.70330810546875	12.0	481.95355224609375	52
perfectly matches this distorted reading). But is it the case that eastern Europe was so void of any	56.699951171875	251.5032958984375	12.0	482.025634765625	52
internal resources for the project of European integration? Surely, the imposition of Sovietization	56.699951171875	265.30328369140625	12.0	481.95361328125	52
and Stalinism had dire consequences in terms of cult of personality, control of the Communist Party	56.699951171875	279.103271484375	12.0	481.90679931640625	52
and loss of economic, political or cultural autonomy. Yet, there were diverse attempts within	56.699951171875	292.90325927734375	12.0	481.95599365234375	52
eastern Europe to remodel socialism with a human face or to propose autonomy with different	56.699951171875	306.7032470703125	12.0	481.96441650390625	52
forms (certain writings of Castoriadis (1976) such as the The Hungarian Source are reminders of	56.699951171875	320.469482421875	12.03375244140625	481.91510009765625	52
internal dynamics that have been overlooked and possibly forgotten in contemporary	56.699920654296875	334.30322265625	12.0	481.9151306152344	52
historiography), and Yougoslavia was a living example of what we could call a possibly creative	56.699920654296875	348.10321044921875	12.0	481.9320373535156	52

communist underground movements in eastern Europe inspired by the Helsinki conference. Yet, by	56.699951171875	375.70318603515625	12.0	481.88995361328125	52
portraying eastern Europe as a single entity, one tends to loose these elements and consider only the	56.699951171875	389.503173828125	12.0	481.98480224609375	52
common exposure to Soviet totalitarianism, which will not do justice to different national	56.699951171875	403.30316162109375	12.0	481.95001220703125	52
experiences and legacies. Paul Blokker’s latest work (see his paper for this Conference) is precisely	56.699951171875	417.1031494140625	12.0	481.9859619140625	52
about retrieving the positive impact of central and eastern European political thought on political	56.699951171875	430.90313720703125	12.0	481.9620361328125	52
theory in general deserves particular attention against a reducing view on eastern Europe, while	56.69996643066406	444.703125	12.0	481.9308319091797	52
Christian Domnitz has presented elsewhere a typology of rich discourses about Europe that	56.70001220703125	458.50311279296875	12.0	481.95599365234375	52
emerged in the Ostblock in the period 1970-1990 (Domnitz 2008). This latter work demonstrates	56.70001220703125	472.2693786621094	12.033721923828125	482.02197265625	52
how certain themes of a cultural Europe premised on Christianity or other historical traits have also	56.70001220703125	486.10308837890625	12.0	481.95001220703125	52
emerged in the shadow of communism and highlight some common ground between East and West	56.70001220703125	499.903076171875	12.0	481.92724609375	52
of Europe, far from views depicting Eastern Europe as void of possible contribution to Europe at	56.69999694824219	513.7030639648438	12.0	481.9679718017578	52

The second problem with a certain idea of ‘Europe’ is related to the question of collective	92.10000610351562	583.9032592773438	11.999984741210938	446.5619812011719	54
identity (and we will touch here on the necessity of auto-institution on the cognitive level	56.70001220703125	597.7032470703125	12.0	481.9727783203125	54
introduced in the introduction). As known from social sciences, the question of identity is a very	56.70001220703125	611.5032348632812	12.0	481.94403076171875	54
slippery one for it automatically refers to a political project and/or point of view (Wagner 2005).	56.70001220703125	625.30322265625	12.0	481.96563720703125	54
With regard to collective identity18 one should always consider the relation of a polity to its present,	56.70001220703125	636.6641235351562	14.439208984375	482.345947265625	54
future but also to its past. An integrated Europe in the present form is an agglomerate of 27 member	56.69999694824219	652.9033203125	12.0	481.94996643066406	54
states whose future is to aim at integrating into a single market and, possibly, expand to include new	56.699981689453125	666.703369140625	12.0	481.9103698730469	54
member states in the future. Even if the stress is put on the acquis communautaire (expressed	56.699981689453125	680.4696044921875	12.03375244140625	481.8864440917969	54
generally in legal terms) as a binding common element to the 27 member states, there remains the	56.70001220703125	694.3033447265625	12.0	481.9931640625	54

Judt perfectly demonstrates how the end of WW2, Soviet rule and the liberation from	92.0999984741211	127.96337890625	12.0	446.5043716430664	58
USSR’s yoke have provoked serious distortions of the past and have made of the past ‘another	56.699981689453125	141.76336669921875	12.0	481.8983459472656	58
country’ (Judt 2002). Thus, the imposition of a Soviet totalitarian domination and the destruction of	56.699981689453125	155.5633544921875	12.0	481.8348083496094	58

not enough time has passed since. Western Europe, on the other hand, has had more time to	56.699981689453125	238.30328369140625	12.0	481.9836120605469	58

political instabilities of the immediate post-war in France, Italy or Germany provoked (yet, this does	56.699981689453125	265.90325927734375	12.0	481.8108215332031	58

Troebst (2005. 2006) is most useful for he points to the fragmented themes of memory across	56.70001220703125	321.10333251953125	12.0	481.884033203125	59
Europe. If the Holocaust is a fundamental point for collective western European memory, other	56.70001220703125	334.9033203125	12.0	481.93914794921875	59
themes occupy the fore of collective debates in Central and Eastern European countries, changing	56.70001220703125	348.70330810546875	12.0	481.99444580078125	59
from the trauma of foreign occupations and dismemberment by Nazi and then Soviet troops	56.70001220703125	362.5032958984375	12.0	481.85400390625	59
(Poland, Baltic Countries, e.g.), the Gulag experience, or also the terrible recollection of Holodomor	56.70001220703125	376.30328369140625	12.0	481.82159423828125	59
(the 1932-33 famine in parts of the Soviet Union which struck large parts of Ukraine). Troebst is	56.70001220703125	390.103271484375	12.0	481.88043212890625	59
correct to state that the 2004 enlargement has revealed the depth of the difference in terms of	56.70001220703125	403.90325927734375	12.0	481.9271240234375	59
collective memory between East and West Europe.19	56.699981689453125	415.2641296386719	14.439117431640625	253.4703369140625	59
Henri Rousso’s article on the dilemma of a European identity (2004) is central for our	92.0999984741211	445.3033447265625	12.0	446.4636001586914	60
discussion of heterochrony. Rousso indicates first that there seems to be a pattern in which	56.70001220703125	459.10333251953125	12.0	481.97161865234375	60
collective occultation and recollection of historical traumas follow one another (amnesia,	56.70001220703125	472.9033203125	12.0	482.00396728515625	60
anamnesis, etc.). Second, there are also uncompressible times through which historical memory has	56.70001220703125	486.70330810546875	12.0	481.91046142578125	60
to go through before any given large social group is able to accept a commonly shared interpretation	56.70001220703125	500.5032958984375	12.0	481.97039794921875	60
of the collective past: one cannot expect that a society will deal with its past right after the end of a	56.70001220703125	514.3032836914062	12.0	481.98004150390625	60
traumatic experience. Judt’s concluding essay ‘From the House of Dead’ of his Postwar (2005)	56.70001220703125	528.069580078125	12.03369140625	481.93194580078125	60
shows the timing and length of occultation of certain debates. To come back to the theme that	56.70001220703125	541.9032592773438	12.0	481.939208984375	60
‘Europe’ is in need of a common memory to reinforce its sense of identity, one should note that if	56.70001220703125	555.7032470703125	12.0	481.90911865234375	60
‘Europe’ is about using western European historical experience as a possible foundation for a	56.70001220703125	569.5032348632812	12.0	482.03533935546875	60
European identity (as a way to go beyond war between nations, and per antonomase a war between	56.70001220703125	583.26953125	12.033676147460938	481.95599365234375	60
France and Germany), then this historical experience might not be easily accepted by Eastern	56.699981689453125	597.103271484375	12.0	481.9488220214844	60
Europeans for two reasons. First, because not all Eastern Europeans have the same traumatic past to	56.699981689453125	610.9032592773438	12.0	482.0256042480469	60
confront (Troebst 2006) and because they are in a different phase of their work on memory	56.699951171875	624.7032470703125	12.0	481.9595947265625	60
(Erinnerungsarbeit) since they have just come out the traumatic Soviet domination for forty years.	56.699951171875	638.4695434570312	12.03369140625	473.1864013671875	60
We are now back to the allochronism question. If one sustains that Eastern Europeans are	92.0999984741211	666.1033325195312	12.0	446.50199127197266	61
dragging their feet in acknowledging the centrality of the Holocaust for a common European	56.69999694824219	679.9033203125	12.0	481.9607696533203	61
identity, this is not just putting them in another time (a la Fabian), but it is also forcing onto them a	56.70001220703125	693.6696166992188	12.03375244140625	481.9320068359375	61
certain theme to confront at the expenses of those considered more urgent by the collective memory	56.700042724609375	707.5033569335938	12.0	482.0099792480469	61

of this region. It is in this condition that an allochronic statement (‘they are dragging their feet..’)	56.70000076293945	72.76336669921875	12.0	482.01594161987305	64
becomes an alienating statement leading to a situation of heterochrony, that is a situation of	56.70001220703125	86.5633544921875	12.0	481.9163818359375	64
cognitive heteronomy motivated in terms of different time locations.	56.700042724609375	100.36334228515625	12.0	328.9871826171875	64
The literature on Central and Eastern Europe and from Eastern European writers abound of	92.10000610351562	127.96337890625	12.0	446.5223693847656	65
the theme of allochronism. The idea of a ‘return’ to Europe implies in an indirect way different time	56.70001220703125	141.76336669921875	12.0	482.196044921875	65
locations and the necessity of ‘touching base’ with the main time of Europe. Some of Czeslaw	56.70001220703125	155.5633544921875	12.0	481.9727783203125	65
Milosz’s writings about his experience as a Pole in western Europe is tainted of connotation of	56.70001220703125	169.36334228515625	12.0	481.88873291015625	65
backwardness and how this self-perception has affected him and co-nationals.20 Note that	56.70001220703125	180.72412109375	14.439208984375	481.9248046875	65
allochronism is by no means a feature of western Europeans, but also by eastern Europeans	56.699981689453125	196.9033203125	12.0	481.9596252441406	65
themselves21. Barbra Törnquist-Plewa notes that “Polish ‘Euro-enthusiasts’ who advocate a speedy	56.699981689453125	208.26409912109375	14.43927001953125	482.0712585449219	65

limited, fanatically religious, nationalistic, burdened with the heritage of the past and immature.”	56.70001220703125	238.3033447265625	12.0	481.88165283203125	65
(Törnquist-Plewa 2002: 237). The fact that allochronic trope can at times become heterochrony is	56.70001220703125	252.10333251953125	12.0	481.8792724609375	65
exemplified in the following quote of Janis Peters, Chairman of the Writers’ Union of the Latvian	56.70002746582031	265.9033203125	12.0	481.93919372558594	65
Republic and Latvian writer answering a comment in 1989 about Russians: “The proposition that	56.70001220703125	279.70330810546875	12.0	481.9776611328125	65
the Russians are worse off is no consolation for the Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians, or a reason	56.70002746582031	293.5032958984375	12.0	481.9919891357422	65
for waiting for a deteriorating situation also in the Baltic area. Why compare us with less developed	56.70001220703125	307.30328369140625	12.0	481.92718505859375	65
regions? Compare us instead with Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark” (quoted in Karlsson	56.70001220703125	321.103271484375	12.0	481.8743896484375	65
2002: 182). Here clearly the writer expresses the view that the Baltic countries resent being ascribed	56.70001220703125	334.90325927734375	12.0	481.954833984375	65
to a backward situation and would prefer to choose to be compared and be part of the more	56.70001220703125	348.7032470703125	12.0	481.907958984375	65

Heterochrony is therefore a serious hurdle in the ideational convergence of self-perceptions	92.10359954833984	390.1033630371094	12.0	446.4852066040039	66
as ‘Europeans’ by Eastern Europeans. This impression for Central and East Europe that a certain	56.70001220703125	403.9033508300781	12.0	481.97998046875	66
past and certain type of Erinnerungsarbeit that provide significance mostly to western Europeans	56.70001220703125	417.66961669921875	12.033721923828125	481.97039794921875	66
are leading Eastern Europeans to a certain form of resentment towards ‘Europe’.22 Törnquist-Plewa	56.70001220703125	429.0641174316406	14.439239501953125	481.9031982421875	66
stresses in the Polish case that “identification with Europe is made difficult by the fact that Poles do	56.699981689453125	445.3033447265625	12.0	481.9535827636719	66
not feel accepted by those they want to identify with” (Törnquist-Plewa 2002: 239). This problem	56.699981689453125	459.10333251953125	12.0	481.9271545410156	66
can hardly be written off for large parts of Eastern Europe which has suffered from external power	56.699981689453125	472.9033203125	12.0	481.9955749511719	66
(Fremdherrschaft) and it is extremely important to acknowledge this problem. So, while Troebst is	56.69996643066406	486.6695861816406	12.033721923828125	481.9332733154297	66
right in pointing to a variety of traumas that Europeans have to confront, one should also think of	56.699974060058594	500.5032958984375	12.0	481.8875503540039	66
the timing of trauma elaboration and Erinnerungsarbeit. One cannot therefore expect, e.g.,	56.699951171875	514.26953125	12.03375244140625	481.9320068359375	66
Estonians to recognize the centrality of Holocaust for a European memory, when it is still facing	56.699951171875	528.103271484375	12.0	481.97998046875	66
burning questions about the past of Soviet occupation and Russification policies (Kattago 2008a)	56.699951171875	541.9032592773438	12.0	481.85406494140625	66
and has become (again) independent ‘not even’ twenty years ago. Any society should therefore	56.699951171875	555.7032470703125	12.0	481.87200927734375	66
have the right, on a cognitive level, to say: “Holocaust, or Holodomor, is not the central worry for	56.699981689453125	569.5032348632812	12.0	481.8202819824219	66
us now” and assert its own priority in terms of collective memory, if such statements are	56.69996643066406	583.26953125	12.033676147460938	481.9559783935547	66
accompanied by a corollary moral obligation to acknowledge the suffering of others. If not, there is	56.699951171875	597.103271484375	12.0	481.86724853515625	66
an imposition from outside23 of a given memory agenda that prevents full autonomy for that	56.699951171875	608.464111328125	14.439208984375	482.0184326171875	66
society. As put by the Estonian scholar Siobhan Kattago (2008b), there should be, between eastern	56.699981689453125	624.703369140625	12.0	481.9823913574219	66
and western Europe an ‘agreement to disagree’ on memory and cultural identity.	56.699981689453125	638.5033569335938	12.0	386.68804931640625	66

(2004: 180ff). Note that these oriental orientalists or in our case Eastern European allochronists are an indirect witness	56.697052001953125	703.5037231445312	10.020004272460938	473.9339904785156	67

speak in reality of western Europe’s historical experience, then it will be difficult for Eastern	56.700042724609375	130.9295654296875	12.03375244140625	481.9679870605469	70

and themes. Looking at the history of European integration through the prism of the Cold War, as	56.700042724609375	186.16326904296875	12.0	481.9369201660156	70
done by Messenger (2006) is a good reminder (against the euphoria of federalist historiography24)	56.70001220703125	197.464111328125	14.439208984375	481.9559326171875	70
of the serious security considerations at stake in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the time where the	56.699951171875	213.70330810546875	12.0	481.81195068359375	70
first European communities were founded. What such history does not tell us really is that the	56.699920654296875	227.5032958984375	12.0	481.8695983886719	70
context of Cold War served also an ‘imaginary war’, to take the phrase of Kaldor (1990) where the	56.699951171875	241.30328369140625	12.0	481.921142578125	70
enemy was not so much the external ‘other’ (eastern European communism, or Stalinism as it was	56.699951171875	255.103271484375	12.0	481.90447998046875	70
frequently described) but the internal ‘other’, namely the opposition of the western European	56.69996643066406	268.90325927734375	12.0	481.8863983154297	70
communists in western Europe (or the red threat in the USA of the McCarthy era). The consequence	56.699981689453125	282.7032470703125	12.0	481.9032287597656	70
of this was that for a few decades the discourse of the threat of the Soviets and of Stalinism (which	56.699981689453125	296.50323486328125	12.0	481.9800109863281	70
was tied to the first years of the European communities) served the purpose of taming part of the	56.699981689453125	310.30322265625	12.0	481.9331970214844	70
political forces in the Europe of the Six (communist parties and trade unions in particular),	56.699981689453125	324.10321044921875	12.0	481.9427795410156	70
undermining thus the possibility of representing the construction of a new Europe as a political	56.699951171875	337.9031982421875	12.0	481.96441650390625	70
project of all its citizens, and even in some cases alienating some segments of the population from	56.699951171875	351.6694641113281	12.033721923828125	481.95361328125	70
supporting the European cause.25 So one consequence of the brandishing of external other’s threat	56.699920654296875	363.0641174316406	14.439239501953125	481.9248962402344	70
for ‘Europe’ with a view on internal affairs was that it turned effectively this external other into a	56.70001220703125	379.3033447265625	12.0	481.9847412109375	70
forgotten other of Europe, in the sense that it reinforced the view that Eastern Europe was totally	56.70001220703125	393.10333251953125	12.0	482.0736083984375	70

In a parallel way, and to come back to current times, one could say that a political Europe	92.0999984741211	434.50335693359375	12.0	446.5560073852539	71
ought to be careful when representing itself as a positive project offering equal opportunity for all in	56.699981689453125	448.3033447265625	12.0	482.0280456542969	71
its drive to open up new horizons for eastern Europeans and integrate into (western) Europe. After	56.70001220703125	462.10333251953125	12.0	482.00396728515625	71
all, there is a sense of a Europe with two speeds, on the one hand, one within the Euro-zone and (at	56.70001220703125	475.9033203125	12.0	481.99444580078125	71

and a reality of a prosperous western Europe and, on the other hand, still devastated socio-economic	56.699981689453125	503.5032958984375	12.0	482.1166687011719	71

lasting consequences of the Cold War: to a certain degree, European integration of eastern Europe	56.69999694824219	558.7032470703125	12.0	481.9475860595703	71
has overlapped with the military expansion of NATO, the history of ‘Europe’ is mostly that of a	56.699981689453125	572.5032348632812	12.0	482.0328674316406	71

Europe by 1989 and to a-void western-euro-centrism at large when looking at European integration	56.70001220703125	211.9033203125	12.0	481.98480224609375	76
and 1989. Indeed when the presence of external ‘others’ loom over certain political debates or serve	56.70001220703125	225.70330810546875	12.0	482.03759765625	76
as a marker of differentiation between large social groups, this is often done at the expenses of a	56.70001220703125	239.5032958984375	12.0	481.82159423828125	76

(one of which can be a repli identitaire fed by collective resentment) and lead to essentalisations	56.70001220703125	267.06951904296875	12.03375244140625	481.968017578125	76

Since Eastern Europe is the geographical space from which the ‘other’ of Stalinism and	92.0999984741211	322.3033447265625	12.0	446.5103530883789	77
communism threatened the Europe of the Six in the 1950s, one should examine the relations	56.699981689453125	336.10333251953125	12.0	481.9391784667969	77
between a political Europe and Eastern Europe also in this light and with great attention. Surely	56.69996643066406	349.9033203125	12.0	481.94395446777344	77
Eastern Europe no longer represents such an ‘other’ for a political Europe, but lasting imprints of	56.699920654296875	363.70330810546875	12.0	482.0087585449219	77

might render this work difficult. Now that ‘Europe’ is made of 27 member states, surely the centre	56.69993591308594	391.30328369140625	12.0	482.0076446533203	77
of gravity of a common political Europe has moved eastwards, a fact that one could clearly perceive	56.69993591308594	405.103271484375	12.0	482.0784454345703	77

probably still has to be re-adjusted accordingly, giving more voice and space to eastern European	56.699951171875	474.10321044921875	12.0	481.93798828125	77
experiences and projects. If not, one risks creating artificial binaries rendering ideational	56.699951171875	487.9031982421875	12.0	481.93194580078125	77

Such binary divides can also be found in the self-reflective dimensions of Europe when a	92.0999984741211	529.3033447265625	12.0	446.4419937133789	78

about Central and Eastern European societies. One dimension of this contemporary ‘otherization’	56.699981689453125	556.9033203125	12.0	481.9463806152344	78
