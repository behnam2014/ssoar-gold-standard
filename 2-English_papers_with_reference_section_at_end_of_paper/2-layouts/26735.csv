Abstract	170.25	65.72515869140625	18.0	72.12599182128906	14
In this paper I address, in a preliminary way, a problem of political theory	170.25	97.57958984375	9.75	313.5435791015625	15
that, while not new, has been brought home with special urgency by recent	170.25	109.57958984375	9.75	324.0301208496094	15
events. The problem is the predicament created by the imperative of coming	170.25	121.57958984375	9.75	326.37872314453125	15
to terms with the subject of political possibility and the concomitant	170.25	133.57958984375	9.75	291.71417236328125	15
difficulty of doing so. The argument of this paper is circuitous. I first argue	170.25	145.57958984375	9.75	315.8500061035156	15
that grappling with the subject of political possibility requires that we	170.25	157.57958984375	9.75	294.13397216796875	15
examine the intimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics. I draw a	170.25	169.57958984375	9.75	310.5666198730469	15
crucial distinction between the ways that the ability to calculate	170.25	181.57958984375	9.75	273.7887878417969	15
probabilities and to entertain possibilities enters into social and political	170.25	193.57958984375	9.75	308.2420654296875	15
interaction. I than identify the mechanisms – attention and imagination – at	170.25	205.57958984375	9.75	323.1907043457031	15
work in the ways symbolic forms govern our ability to envision possibilities. I	170.25	217.57958984375	9.75	327.8343200683594	15
show how political possibility is implicated with power. And I sketch some	170.25	229.57958984375	9.75	318.7867431640625	15
of the constraints and vicissitudes that make the politics of possibility a	170.25	241.57958984375	9.75	308.2922058105469	15
precarious enterprise. I conclude by briefly connecting my preceding	170.25	253.57958984375	9.75	294.1130065917969	15
analysis to the theme of antipolitics.	170.25	265.57958984375	9.75	156.70806884765625	15

In this paper I address a problem of political theory that, while not new, has	170.25	97.57958984375	9.75	324.0135498046875	22
been brought home with special urgency by recent events. The problem is	170.25	109.57958984375	9.75	318.8124694824219	22
the predicament created by the imperative of coming to terms with the	170.25	121.57958984375	9.75	301.6026306152344	22
subject of political possibility and the concomitant difficulty of doing so	170.25	133.57958984375	9.75	303.96600341796875	22
(Dunn 1980, 267,260). In the face of this quandary I pursue a basic intuition:	170.25	145.57958984375	9.75	327.8179931640625	22
in order to properly conceptualize political possibility we must recognize	170.25	157.57958984375	9.75	310.57135009765625	22
and analyze the intimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics. In other	170.25	169.57958984375	9.75	324.814453125	22
words, in order to better understand the notion of political possibility we	170.25	181.57958984375	9.75	306.8288879394531	22
must properly grasp its cultural dimensions. An example will perhaps lend	170.25	193.57958984375	9.75	318.82318115234375	22
some, at least initial, plausibility to this intuition.	170.25	205.57958984375	9.75	208.44183349609375	22
The example is drawn from an interview, conducted in October 1982,	192.75	217.57958984375	9.75	295.5483703613281	22
with Bogdan Borusewisz, a Solidarity activist and underground leader. Early	170.25	229.57958984375	9.75	327.03350830078125	22
in the interview he harshly criticized the stance adopted by some Solidarity	170.25	241.57958984375	9.75	324.0066223144531	22
leaders during the period leading up to December 1981 when the Polish	170.25	253.57958984375	9.75	307.64923095703125	22
regime imposed marshal law.	170.25	265.57958984375	9.75	126.79861450195312	22
“There came a point when democratically elected activists lost all	192.75	289.57958984375	9.75	282.0144958496094	23
contact with reality. And reality was more than Solidarity, more than	192.75	301.57958984375	9.75	293.3053283691406	23
radical leaflets, and Radio Free Europe; it was the USSR, the army,	192.75	313.57958984375	9.75	293.2782897949219	23
and the security service, which we already knew in the autumn of 1980	192.75	325.57958984375	9.750030517578125	304.682861328125	23
had drawn up a list of people to be interned (Lopinski, Moskit and	192.75	337.5796203613281	9.75	281.3571472167969	23
Wilk, 1990, 8).”	192.75	349.5796203613281	9.75	67.40289306640625	23
In other words, Borusewisz was no wild utopian, intent on holding out	170.25	373.5796203613281	9.75	298.54583740234375	24
fantastic alternatives. He was aware that political reality and possibility are,	170.25	385.5796203613281	9.75	324.6856689453125	24
in crucial ways, distinguished by material considerations.	170.25	397.5796203613281	9.75	247.47262573242188	24
In the same interview, however, Borusewisz reflects on the reasons	192.75	409.5796203613281	9.75	289.573486328125	24
why, during the days immediately after the regime imposed martial law, he	170.25	421.5796203613281	9.75	321.0888366699219	24
and others thought it imperative to sustain the strike at the Lenin shipyard.	170.25	433.5796203613281	9.75	321.74200439453125	24
“After all we had to defend a symbol; it wasn’t a question of the	192.75	457.5796203613281	9.75	271.6008605957031	25
Gdansk shipyard or the Repair Yard or even Gdansk itself but of	192.75	469.5796203613281	9.75	275.39263916015625	25
Poland as a whole. If we’d managed to draw out the strike in the	192.75	481.5796203613281	9.75	276.1197509765625	25
shipyard it might have been possible to hold back the authorities on all	192.75	493.5796203613281	9.75	304.49920654296875	25
fronts. On the other hand, I was certain that if the strike at the	192.75	505.57958984375	9.75	266.3296813964844	25
shipyard collapsed, the fact that a coal mine or steel works was on	192.75	517.57958984375	9.75	288.80792236328125	25
strike wouldn’t have made any difference, because people think in	192.75	529.57958984375	9.75	282.89227294921875	25
terms of symbols and would hang on as long as the shipyard hung on.	192.75	541.57958984375	9.75	303.7969970703125	25
That is why I tried desperately to defend the shipyard (Lopinski, Moskit	192.75	553.57958984375	9.75	306.01953125	25
and Wilk 1990, 30–31).”	192.75	565.57958984375	9.75	104.209228515625	25
As this passage makes clear, Borusewisz and others recognized that, over	170.25	589.57958984375	9.75	324.1045227050781	26
a decade or so, Poles invested the Gdansk shipyard with special	170.25	601.57958984375	9.75	280.490234375	26
significance. They had transformed the shipyard into a symbol, one that	170.25	613.57958984375	9.75	309.7724304199219	26
enabled opponents of the regime to sustain an alternative vision of ‘Poland	170.25	625.57958984375	9.75	318.89752197265625	26
as a whole.’1 Consequently, it became a focal point in the strategic struggle	170.25	637.298095703125	11.531494140625	327.8907470703125	26
between the opposition and the regime. Unlike strikes elsewhere, the one at	170.25	651.07958984375	9.75	328.5332336425781	26
the shipyard, according to Borusewisz, symbolized the possibility, however	170.25	663.07958984375	9.75	324.0755615234375	26
fleeting, that Poles might resist marshal law. Ultimately, Solidarity could not	170.25	675.07958984375	9.75	328.4680480957031	26
1 I take Solidarity to be a paradigmatic antipolitical movement (Ost 1990). The shipyard is	170.25	706.4014282226562	11.25	320.1289367675781	27
among the central symbols in the “tradition of resistance” that Polish workers first	170.25	720.20166015625	9.75	288.4012451171875	27
constructed and then extended to other portions of society (Laba 1991).	170.25	733.4014282226562	8.25	251.02947998046875	27

Johnson The Politics of Possibility	283.5	780.95166015625	9.75	139.437255859375	29
sustain the strike at the shipyard. And although other strikes continued, the	170.25	63.82958984375	9.75	326.3212585449219	30
collapse of the strike there rendered the possibility of widespread, overt	170.25	75.82958984375	9.75	306.8048400878906	30
resistance inconceivable.	170.25	87.82958984375	9.75	108.04983520507812	30
This example is intended to suggest how intimately connected symbol and	170.25	99.82958984375	9.75	322.5648498535156	30
strategy are in social and political life, and how they are related in ways that	170.25	111.82958984375	9.75	328.53704833984375	30
directly effect our capacity to envision political possibilities. My aim in this	170.25	123.82958984375	9.75	320.2162170410156	30
paper is to explore, and hopefully clarify, these claims in a preliminary way.	170.25	135.82958984375	9.75	325.5133056640625	30
The remainder of the paper consists of six sections. In sections two	192.75	147.82958984375	9.75	291.8039855957031	30
and three I draw and hopefully make clear a crucial distinction between the	170.25	159.82958984375	9.75	321.86346435546875	30
ways that the ability to calculate probabilities and to entertain possibilities	170.25	171.82958984375	9.75	319.47607421875	30
enter into social and political interaction. And I argue that the latter capacity	170.25	183.82958984375	9.75	327.6544494628906	30
is governed by the force of prevailing symbolic forms. In section four I	170.25	195.82958984375	9.75	296.403076171875	30
identify the mechanisms at work in the ways symbolic forms govern our	170.25	207.82958984375	9.75	308.3343200683594	30
ability to envision possibilities. In section five I address the ways that	170.25	219.82958984375	9.75	297.0147705078125	30
political possibility is implicated with power. In section six I sketch some of	170.25	231.82958984375	9.75	324.056640625	30
the constraints and vicissitudes that render the politics of possibility a	170.25	243.82958984375	9.75	300.7983703613281	30
difficult and precarious undertaking. In section seven I briefly connect my	170.25	255.82958984375	9.75	313.5494079589844	30
argument to the theme of antipolitics.	170.25	267.82958984375	9.75	161.25103759765625	30
II.	170.25	292.97515869140625	18.0	15.503997802734375	31
“What is politically possible depends in part on what men believe” (Dunn	170.25	324.82958984375	9.750030517578125	310.626953125	32
1980, 260).2 This is no doubt so. But it also is too quick. I put to one side	170.25	336.5481262207031	11.531494140625	317.26904296875	32
for the moment matters of material or physical constraint. In this section I	170.25	350.3296203613281	9.75	316.5209045410156	32
argue that the scope of political possibility is, in the most basic,	170.25	362.3296203613281	9.75	276.636962890625	32
theoretically important sense constituted not by beliefs or expectations per	170.25	374.3296203613281	9.75	323.4461669921875	32
se, but by the range of things (e.g., actors, events, outcomes) concerning	170.25	386.3296203613281	9.75	317.3274230957031	32
which relevant agents can hold beliefs or establish expectations. Here	170.25	398.3296203613281	9.75	301.6709899902344	32
again, perhaps an example will help.	170.25	410.3296203613281	9.75	157.55401611328125	32
In his Antipolitics, a book largely devoted to envisioning a possible	192.75	422.3296203613281	9.75	285.1606750488281	32
post-Yalta political framework, George Konrad reflected on, among other	170.25	434.3296203613281	9.75	311.3922119140625	32
things, the prevailing uncoordinated, largely individualistic strategy of	170.25	446.3296203613281	9.75	294.8912048339844	32
opposition in Hungary. He explained that:	170.25	458.3296203613281	9.75	178.53472900390625	32
“We Hungarians never created our own KOR or Solidarity, because we	192.75	482.3296203613281	9.75	303.1516418457031	33
didn’t really believe that communist power could be reconciled with	192.75	494.3296203613281	9.75	287.36578369140625	33
democratic institutions born of society’s aspirations of self-	192.75	506.32958984375	9.75	254.49676513671875	33
determination. We saw what our Polish friends were doing; we wanted	192.75	518.32958984375	9.75	301.6523742675781	33
them to succeed, but doubted that they could (Konrad 1984, 129–30).”	192.75	530.32958984375	9.75	305.209228515625	33
This is a straightforward estimation of probabilities. Oppositional elements	170.25	554.32958984375	9.75	318.775634765625	34
in Hungary, according to Konrad, had no difficulty envisioning collective	170.25	566.32958984375	9.75	305.68768310546875	34
political strategies such as those adopted by KOR or Solidarity. They	170.25	578.32958984375	9.749984741210938	299.9873046875	34
simply believed that such strategies held out a very low probability of	170.25	590.32958984375	9.75	295.60943603515625	34
success.	170.25	602.32958984375	9.75	39.5220947265625	34
Consider, by contrast, the emergence of radically unanticipated actors	192.75	614.32958984375	9.75	303.7538146972656	34
onto the political stage. When I say that such actors are radically	170.25	626.32958984375	9.75	285.71929931640625	34
unanticipated I mean that ex ante their appearance as political actors was	170.25	638.32958984375	9.75	318.75994873046875	34
not just unforeseen but unforeseeable. Here we might include, for instance,	170.25	650.32958984375	9.75	323.3079833984375	34
the way that the British working classes intruded into politics under the	170.25	662.32958984375	9.75	306.1832580566406	34
aegis of Chartism in the late 1830’s. Or, more recently, and perhaps of	170.25	674.32958984375	9.75	303.84912109375	34
2 Dunn himself is concerned with grounding the notion of political obligation in a general	170.25	706.4014282226562	11.25	314.1100769042969	35
conception of what in different times and places is political possible. He does not	170.25	721.4014282226562	8.25	281.0505065917969	35
systematically explore the notion of political possibility.	170.25	733.4014282226562	8.25	197.05865478515625	35

way mothers infiltrated Argentine politics in the late 1970’s. In such	170.25	75.82958984375	9.75	289.57525634765625	38
instances the very incongruity of such actors engaging in politics – as	170.25	87.82958984375	9.75	301.39801025390625	38
workers, or as mothers – scrambles established political categories and,	170.25	99.82958984375	9.75	314.22650146484375	38
thereby redefines the realm of possibility.3 In the latter case, for a period of	170.25	111.54815673828125	11.53143310546875	321.92138671875	38
time this incongruity prevented the Argentine Junta from recognizing the	170.25	125.32958984375	9.75	309.2335510253906	38
Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo as political actors in any relevant sense.	170.25	137.32958984375	9.75	307.5087585449219	38
Within the political categories to which the junta, like the rest of Argentine	170.25	149.32958984375	9.75	318.7986145019531	38
society, subscribed, “mothers were not perceived as political subjects.” The	170.25	161.32958984375	9.75	326.4209899902344	38
Mothers of the Plaza, as a result, were enshrouded by a “political	170.25	173.32958984375	9.75	282.0222473144531	38
invisibility” that afforded them a strategically crucial, if temporary, advantage	170.25	185.32958984375	9.75	326.36419677734375	38
over the junta.4 This was a matter not of probability but of possibility or, for	170.25	197.04815673828125	11.53143310546875	320.34429931640625	38
lack of a better word, worldview. During the early months of the Mother’s	170.25	210.82958984375	9.75	311.3231201171875	38
weekly demonstrations in the Plaza de Mayo, the junta literally did not	170.25	222.82958984375	9.75	304.4914245605469	38
understand the political nature of the protests. Such activity transgressed	170.25	234.82958984375	9.75	315.8284912109375	38
the boundaries of their political world. It simply was not possible for mothers	170.25	246.82958984375	9.75	327.10260009765625	38
to engage in politics.5 By the time the junta reconfigured their conception of	170.25	258.54815673828125	11.53143310546875	325.61322021484375	38
political possibility so that they could recognize the Mothers as political	170.25	272.32958984375	9.75	309.7061767578125	38
actors, and take repressive measures, it was too late. The Mothers of the	170.25	284.32958984375	9.75	315.8346252441406	38
Plaza already had come to symbolize, both domestically and in the	170.25	296.32958984375	9.75	291.0562744140625	38
international arena, the possibility of open resistance to the Argentine	170.25	308.32958984375	9.75	299.34716796875	38
regime.	170.25	320.32958984375	9.750030517578125	31.643692016601562	38
A worldview amounts to a basic understanding of how the world	192.75	332.3296203613281	9.75	272.4082336425781	38
operates, of the sorts of entities (actors, events, outcomes) it contains.	170.25	344.3296203613281	9.75	306.6824035644531	38
Among the components of a worldview is a more or less systematic “folk	170.25	356.3296203613281	9.75	313.52471923828125	38
psychology,” a general conception of persons and a corresponding set of	170.25	368.3296203613281	9.75	313.6151123046875	38
expectations about how they typically behave.6 In the present paper I focus	170.25	380.0481262207031	11.531494140625	324.85382080078125	38
exclusively on this dimension of political possibility – the types of political	170.25	393.8296203613281	9.75	317.9736022949219	38
subject that relevant actors can hold beliefs or develop expectations about.	170.25	405.8296203613281	9.75	322.5421447753906	38
III.	170.25	430.97515869140625	18.0	20.753997802734375	39
It is important to distinguish, then, between the different ways that the	170.25	462.8296203613281	9.75	300.8265686035156	40
calculation of probabilities and the consideration of possibilities inform	170.25	474.8296203613281	9.75	301.52325439453125	40
political action.7 And it is important to see how the latter trades upon the	170.25	486.5481262207031	11.531494140625	312.8282165527344	40
3 Dorothy Thompson (1984, 11–12) captures the in congruity of workers entering the	170.25	520.4014282226562	11.25	304.3260803222656	41
political of early nineteenth century Britain in the following way. “In the 1830’s the good	170.25	535.4014282226562	8.25	311.86016845703125	41
self-respecting workman did not mix in politics. ... When HM Inspector of Prisons interviewed	170.25	547.4014282226562	8.25	327.6375427246094	41
the men in prison for Chartist activ ities in 1840, he spoke approvingly of the decision some	170.25	559.4014282226562	8.25	320.0639953613281	41
had made to ‘give up politics.’ It did not occur to him that former Chartists should become	170.25	571.4014282226562	8.25	314.0849609375	41
Whigs or Tories. Politics in any form was not the business of the working man.”	170.25	582.20166015625	9.75	278.8290100097656	41
4 I draw the quoted phrases from Navarro (1989, 257).	170.25	593.9014282226562	11.25	194.71890258789062	42
5 Hence the practice of the junta of referring to the Mothers as the “madwomen” of the	170.25	607.4014282226562	11.55023193359375	310.89093017578125	43
Plaza.	170.25	622.4014282226562	8.25	20.821990966796875	43
6 On this point see generally Geertz (1983, 55–70) and Bruner (1990, 13–14,35,42–	170.25	632.9014282226562	11.55023193359375	301.125	44

7 “There is a fundamental difference between a situation in which a decision maker is	170.25	658.4014282226562	11.25	297.73150634765625	45
uncertain about the state of X and a situation in which the decision maker has not given any	170.25	673.4014282226562	8.25	318.5775146484375	45
thought to whether X matters or not, between a situation in which a prethought event judged	170.25	685.4014282226562	8.25	320.116455078125	45
of low probability occurs and a situation in which something occurs that has never been	170.25	697.4014282226562	8.25	301.34490966796875	45
thought about, between judging an action unlikely to succeed and never thinking about an	170.25	709.4014282226562	8.25	307.38592529296875	45
action. The latter situations in each pair are not adequately modeled in terms of low	170.25	721.4014282226562	8.25	289.3816833496094	45
probabilities” (Nelson and Winter, 1982, 67).	170.25	732.20166015625	9.75	157.98660278320312	45

intimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics. All of this will perhaps	170.25	63.82958984375	9.75	315.7405700683594	48
emerge more clearly if we examine attempts to depict the world solely in	170.25	75.82958984375	9.75	312.9857482910156	48
terms of the calculation of probabilities.	170.25	87.82958984375	9.75	169.51181030273438	48
Consider, in this respect, the austere, counterfactual world that	192.75	99.82958984375	9.75	272.25634765625	48
rational choice theorists construct. Samuel Popkin’s The Rational Peasant	170.25	111.82958984375	9.75	322.5736083984375	48
supplies a particularly instructive example. Early on, Popkin proclaims that	170.25	123.82958984375	9.75	323.1990051269531	48
he will advance an exclusively rational choice analysis of Vietnamese	170.25	135.82958984375	9.75	298.6048889160156	48
peasant politics and that, in so doing, he will treat cultural considerations	170.25	147.82958984375	9.75	315.7467041015625	48
as “givens” (Popkin 1979, 82). He aims to explain peasant politics solely in	170.25	159.82958984375	9.75	322.57440185546875	48
terms of the peasants’ self-interest and their estimates of the likelihood that	170.25	171.82958984375	9.75	326.2530212402344	48
those interests can be realized. Toward the end of the book, however,	170.25	183.82958984375	9.75	300.0792541503906	48
Popkin reflects briefly on the decisive role that he attributes to “political	170.25	195.82958984375	9.75	306.01953125	48
entrepreneurs” in facilitating collective action among peasants (Popkin	170.25	207.82958984375	9.75	301.66192626953125	48
1979, 259–66). He suggests that the success or failure of these leaders	170.25	219.82958984375	9.75	309.76409912109375	48
depended crucially on their competence and credibility. But, somewhat	170.25	231.82958984375	9.75	306.7529296875	48
surprisingly, Popkin insists that their credibility derived from “cultural	170.25	243.82958984375	9.75	294.7508544921875	48
bases.” He attributes the variable success of religious and political	170.25	255.82958984375	9.75	286.52838134765625	48
entrepreneurs over time to their differential ability “to utilize cultural themes”,	170.25	267.82958984375	9.75	327.7888488769531	48
to orchestrate “terms and symbols,” that resonated with their potential	170.25	279.82958984375	9.75	302.27532958984375	48
constituents (Popkin, 1979, 260–61). In short, political entrepreneurs	170.25	291.82958984375	9.75	296.288818359375	48
engender and sustain credibility through symbolic action. They seek to	170.25	303.82958984375	9.75	305.3272399902344	48
coordinate and mobilize relevant constituencies by more or less skillfully	170.25	315.82958984375	9.75	312.7580261230469	48
deploying symbolic forms that have force over them.	170.25	327.82958984375	9.750030517578125	224.32473754882812	48
I will return to Popkin shortly. But now consider a second theoretical	192.75	339.8296203613281	9.75	294.7419128417969	48
example, one much closer to the “core” of the rational choice research	170.25	351.8296203613281	9.75	303.0931701660156	48
tradition. Here I have in mind the ways that, like Popkin, non-cooperative	170.25	363.8296203613281	9.75	312.1497497558594	48
game theorists tacitly incorporate symbolic considerations into their	170.25	375.8296203613281	9.75	292.91748046875	48
purportedly purely strategic models. For present purposes I will consider	170.25	387.8296203613281	9.75	311.3490905761719	48
only one of the ways they do so.8	170.25	399.5481262207031	11.531494140625	145.58700561523438	48
Game theorists tacitly incorporate symbolic force into their standard	192.75	413.3296203613281	9.75	293.3245849609375	48
procedure for transforming games of incomplete information into equivalent	170.25	425.3296203613281	9.75	320.26751708984375	48
but technically more tractable games of complete but imperfect information.	170.25	437.3296203613281	9.75	326.2633972167969	48
This procedure is complex.9 Simply put, it reduces, for analytical purposes,	170.25	449.0481262207031	11.531494140625	326.22296142578125	48
all forms of uncertainty to mutual uncertainty about the payoff functions	170.25	462.8296203613281	9.75	306.78076171875	48
characteristic of players in the game. All players in the game then construct	170.25	474.8296203613281	9.75	328.4886474609375	48
conditional probabilities over the “types” of other player that they might	170.25	486.8296203613281	9.75	303.7933349609375	48
encounter based on an initial objective distribution that game theorists	170.25	498.8296203613281	9.75	302.2765197753906	48
typically attribute to “nature.”	170.25	510.82958984375	9.75	123.91680908203125	48
Symbol and strategy intersect here because, as game theorists	192.75	522.82958984375	9.75	275.98760986328125	48
typically do not recognize, “types” are not natural categories.	170.25	534.82958984375	9.75	263.2424621582031	48
“The everyday world in which members of any community move, their	192.75	558.82958984375	9.75	297.15289306640625	49
taken for granted field of social action, is populated not by anybodies,	192.75	570.82958984375	9.75	300.0314636230469	49
faceless men without qualities, but by somebodies, concrete classes	192.75	582.82958984375	9.749984741210938	299.2113037109375	49
of determinant persons positively characterized and appropriately	192.75	594.82958984375	9.75	280.55218505859375	49
labeled. And the symbol systems which define these classes are not	192.75	606.82958984375	9.75	298.4754638671875	49
given in the nature of things – they are historically constructed,	192.75	618.82958984375	9.75	271.21051025390625	49
socially maintained and individually applied (Geertz 1973, 363–64).”	192.75	630.82958984375	9.75	291.709228515625	49
8 A more obvious example is the way that Schelling (1960) invokes the “symbolic contents	170.25	680.9014282226562	11.25	320.88641357421875	50
of the game” in order to explain how problems of multiple equilibria are resolved in strategic	170.25	694.70166015625	9.75	320.1424255371094	50
settings. This remains the standard resolution t o this endemic problem even among more	170.25	707.9014282226562	8.25	307.3282775878906	50
highly technical game theorists (Kreps 1990, 101; Myerson 1992).	170.25	719.9014282226562	8.25	232.29638671875	50

The range of possible “types” in any population is marked and interpreted	170.25	63.82958984375	9.75	314.37939453125	54
symbolically. Thus, for example, recalling the revolutionary events of Paris	170.25	75.82958984375	9.75	319.53948974609375	54
in 1848, Tocqueville reports repeated encounters with “workers,” whom he	170.25	87.82958984375	9.75	316.6797180175781	54
readily identifies by their “blouses, which, as we all know, are their fighting	170.25	99.82958984375	9.75	319.0080871582031	54
as well as their working clothes” (Tocqueville 1987, 142 stress added).10	170.25	111.54815673828125	11.53143310546875	312.0870056152344	54
Here clothing operates as a symbolic marker, allowing Tocqueville to	170.25	125.32958984375	9.75	295.8924865722656	54
recognize the types of actors he encounters and, thereby, to navigate	170.25	137.32958984375	9.75	299.3519287109375	54
perilous, highly indeterminant political circumstances.	170.25	149.32958984375	9.75	232.46722412109375	54
Return now to Popkin. On his account, the political entrepreneurs who	192.75	161.32958984375	9.75	302.34637451171875	54
sought to coordinate the collective action among the Vietnamese peasantry	170.25	173.32958984375	9.75	326.2576904296875	54
encountered the daunting prior problem of projecting comprehensible,	170.25	185.32958984375	9.75	298.5704040527344	54
credible “visions of the future” (Popkin 1988, 61–62; 1979, 261). This	170.25	197.32958984375	9.75	294.0789794921875	54
required that they recast a political world populated by “rational peasants”	170.25	209.32958984375	9.75	316.60162353515625	54
into one in which other “types” – specifically credible, committed	170.25	221.32958984375	9.75	277.6363220214844	54
entrepreneurs – were genuinely possible. And it required articulating this	170.25	233.32958984375	9.75	312.022216796875	54
possibility in “terms and symbols” that had force for relevant constituencies.	170.25	245.32958984375	9.75	327.0101318359375	54
Popkin argues that Communist organizers did not enjoy success	170.25	257.32958984375	9.75	280.3070068359375	54
comparable to that of religious leaders until they learned to articulate their	170.25	269.32958984375	9.75	317.3469543457031	54
vision of the future in indigenous cultural idioms. Prior to that point	170.25	281.32958984375	9.75	285.04632568359375	54
“[p]easants did not understand why organizers were offering to help them	170.25	293.32958984375	9.75	314.35009765625	54
and were reluctant to join with them for even small local projects” (Popkin	170.25	305.32958984375	9.75	315.1294860839844	54
1988, 62 stress added; 1979, 261). Their world was symbolically	170.25	317.32958984375	9.75	278.2813720703125	54
constituted in such a way that it could not accommodate the entrepreneurs’	170.25	329.32958984375	9.750030517578125	326.99786376953125	54
“type” as a genuine possibility. It thereby foreclosed the very possibility of	170.25	341.3296203613281	9.75	316.78802490234375	54
cooperative collective action.	170.25	353.3296203613281	9.75	123.08026123046875	54

Consider the following remark that Jürgen Habermas once made in the	170.25	410.3296203613281	9.75	303.1492919921875	56
course of a discussion of utopia.	170.25	422.3296203613281	9.75	139.54364013671875	56
“In specific historical moments, where we can recognize a real social	192.75	446.3296203613281	9.75	297.7649230957031	57
movement, real historical struggles, we also become aware that	192.75	458.3296203613281	9.75	275.2980041503906	57
people do not fight for abstractions – despite the three great and	192.75	470.3296203613281	9.75	276.1877746582031	57
ineradicable goals of the French Revolution. People do not fight for	192.75	482.3296203613281	9.75	286.54266357421875	57
abstractions, but with images. Banners, symbols, rhetorical speech,	192.75	494.3296203613281	9.75	294.7073974609375	57
allegorical speech, utopia-inspired speech, in which concrete goals are	192.75	506.32958984375	9.75	305.3801574707031	57
conjured up before people’s eyes, are indeed necessary constituents	192.75	518.32958984375	9.75	297.7756042480469	57
of movements which have any effect on history at all (Habermas, 1986,	192.75	530.32958984375	9.75	305.3285827636719	57
145–6).”	192.75	542.32958984375	9.75	35.906097412109375	57
10 For further references to the “blouses” of workers, see Tocqueville (1987, 117,130,145).	170.25	574.4014282226562	11.55023193359375	319.30499267578125	58
Tocqueville also intimates that workers were adept at interpreting the attire of other classes.	170.25	589.4014282226562	8.25	320.0464782714844	58
For instance, during the June days he and Corcelle, a fellow delegate to the National Assembly,	170.25	601.4014282226562	8.25	326.14447021484375	58
undertook something of a reconnaissance mission through the streets of Paris. He relates one	170.25	613.4014282226562	8.25	322.3199768066406	58
of Corcelle’s adventures in the following terms. “He told me afterwards that, having first	170.25	625.4014282226562	8.25	307.3073425292969	58
passed several half-constructed barricades without obstruction, he was halted at the last one;	170.25	637.4014282226562	8.25	316.3681335449219	58
the workers building it, seeing a fine gentleman in a black suit with clean white linen quietly	170.25	649.4014282226562	8.3677978515625	316.4529113769531	58
walking around the dirty streets by the Hotel de Ville and stopping in front of them with a	170.25	661.4014282226562	8.25	311.0934143066406	58
placid air of curiosity, decided to make some use of this suspicious onlooker. They asked him	170.25	673.4014282226562	8.25	320.8861999511719	58
in the name of fraternity to help them in their work. Corcelle ... in the circumstances ...	170.25	685.4014282226562	8.25	305.0770263671875	58
rightly thought it best to yield without a fuss. So there he was levering up the pavement and	170.25	697.4014282226562	8.25	315.6533508300781	58
putting the stones on top of one another as tidily as he could. His natural clumsiness and his	170.25	709.4014282226562	8.25	316.3929748535156	58
wandering thoughts luckily came to his aid, and he was soon dismissed as a useless laborer”	170.25	720.20166015625	9.75	310.3290100097656	58
(Tocqueville 1987, 139 stress added).	170.25	733.4014282226562	8.25	128.87646484375	58

I agree. In fact, I would suggest that this remark is relevant not just to	170.25	63.82958984375	9.75	298.5935974121094	61
remarkable episodes, but, to political action and interaction more generally.	170.25	75.82958984375	9.75	325.51043701171875	61
Habermas, nonetheless leaves open at least two especially pressing	192.75	87.82958984375	9.75	295.6074523925781	61
sets of theoretical questions. First, if as Bogdan Borusewisz noted in my	170.25	99.82958984375	9.75	314.9798278808594	61
initial example, ‘people think in terms of symbols,’ how are we to	170.25	111.82958984375	9.75	279.0834045410156	61
understand this process. In other words, why do political actors, whether	170.25	123.82958984375	9.75	312.8371887207031	61
individual or collective, indeed fight “with” symbols? What sort of force do	170.25	135.82958984375	9.75	312.87445068359375	61
symbols have that make them effective resources in political struggle? And,	170.25	147.82958984375	9.75	326.2623291015625	61
second, how are we to understand the dynamics of such symbolic	170.25	159.82958984375	9.75	286.5072021484375	61
contests? How do we specify the character of symbolic action? I address	170.25	171.82958984375	9.75	316.5087890625	61
the first set of question in this section and the second set in the next	170.25	183.82958984375	9.75	297.7333679199219	61
section.	170.25	195.82958984375	9.75	33.73078918457031	61
Cultures consist of intersubjectively shared symbols which actors	192.75	207.82958984375	9.75	282.7415771484375	61
invest with meaning and deploy in ritual, tradition and other cultural	170.25	219.82958984375	9.75	288.0538635253906	61
performances. It is a sort of “symbolic strategy for encompassing	170.25	231.82958984375	9.75	280.58380126953125	61
situations,” for imposing conceptual order on otherwise indeterminant	170.25	243.82958984375	9.75	297.78912353515625	61
processes of interaction (Geertz 1973, 250,230,89; Ortner 1984, 129).11	170.25	255.54815673828125	11.53143310546875	310.5870056152344	61
On this view: “Symbols instigate social action” (Turner 1974, 55). However,	170.25	269.32958984375	9.75	321.8153076171875	61
they do so, as I now argue, only indirectly. To see why, it is necessary to	170.25	281.32958984375	9.75	316.5307312011719	61
understand how symbols work. This, in turn, requires that we distinguish for	170.25	293.32958984375	9.75	325.6776123046875	61
analytical purposes the “scope” of symbolic forms from their “force.”	170.25	305.32958984375	9.75	292.51470947265625	61
The scope of a symbol or cultural performance refers to “the range of	192.75	317.32958984375	9.75	294.9017639160156	61
social contexts within which” relevant actors regard it “as having more or	170.25	329.32958984375	9.750030517578125	310.6172790527344	61
less direct relevance.” Its force refers to its “centrality or marginality” in the	170.25	341.3296203613281	9.75	320.3337097167969	61
lives of relevant actors, to the “psychological grip” it exercises over them	170.25	353.3296203613281	9.75	311.29754638671875	61
(Geertz, 1968, 111–113). The efficacy of a set of symbolic forms clearly	170.25	365.3296203613281	9.75	309.03253173828125	61
depends on the scope that actors attribute to it. This accounts for the	170.25	377.3296203613281	9.75	299.32598876953125	61
propensity of oppositional social and political movements, for example, to	170.25	389.3296203613281	9.75	315.8481750488281	61
generate elaborate, encompassing “alternative cultures.”12 Yet force takes	170.25	401.0481262207031	11.531494140625	320.2203063964844	61
analytical priority over scope. Any claim regarding the scope of a particular	170.25	414.8296203613281	9.75	322.0260009765625	61
symbol or practice presupposes that it has force. Absent such force it	170.25	426.8296203613281	9.75	302.2287902832031	61
wouldn’t be relevant to any social context.	170.25	438.8296203613281	9.75	180.62939453125	61
The force of symbolic forms is at bottom cognitive or conceptual	192.75	450.8296203613281	9.75	276.04144287109375	61
(Lukes 1977, 68f). Symbolic forms, orchestrated in cultural performances of	170.25	462.8296203613281	9.75	325.1091613769531	61
various sorts, “structure the way people think about social life” (Moore and	170.25	474.8296203613281	9.75	319.7005920410156	61
Myerhoff 1977, 4).13 They serve as “extrinsic sources of information”	170.25	486.5481262207031	11.531494140625	293.4049987792969	61
(Geertz 1973, 92) not in the sense that they convey detailed messages, but	170.25	500.3296203613281	9.75	327.0181884765625	61
in a broader sense of imparting a view of how the world actually is – how it	170.25	512.32958984375	9.75	319.5513000488281	61
operates and how individuals can be expected to act within it. Symbolic	170.25	524.32958984375	9.75	309.01287841796875	61
11 On this view, culture consists of “a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic	170.25	559.4014282226562	11.25	321.6174621582031	62
forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate and develop their knowledge about	170.25	574.4014282226562	8.25	316.2676696777344	62
and attitudes toward life.” And a symbol is “any object, act, event, quality, or relation which	170.25	585.20166015625	9.75	318.6059265136719	62
serves as a vehicle for a conception – the conception being the symbol’s ‘meaning’ ” (Geertz	170.25	597.20166015625	9.75	320.8905029296875	62
1973, 89,91,10). On the career of this concept of culture see Ortner (1984) and Barth (1989).	170.25	610.4014282226562	8.25	327.5339050292969	62
12 This was true, for example, of British Chartists in the 1830’s and 1840’s, of American	170.25	620.9014282226562	11.25	311.0728454589844	63
populism in the 1890’s, of the turn of the century German labor movement, and of Italian	170.25	635.9014282226562	8.25	313.2823486328125	63
Communists in the 1970’s.	170.25	647.9014282226562	8.25	92.82901000976562	63
13 This obviously presumes something about the way we think. But it does not entail	170.25	658.4014282226562	11.25	293.85906982421875	64
psychological reductionism. Rather, it presumes an “extrinsic theory” of mind in which diverse	170.25	672.20166015625	9.75	328.4243469238281	64
human mental functions – cognition, emotions, dispositions, etc. – all essentially depend upon	170.25	685.4014282226562	8.25	326.1631164550781	64
the availability of sets of symbolic forms (Geertz 1973, 215,45–6,76f,360f). Thus, as	170.25	696.20166015625	9.75	297.0184020996094	64
psychologist Jerome Bruner (1986, 15) contends, “a cultural tool kit – a set of prosthetic	170.25	708.20166015625	9.75	309.49951171875	64
devices, so to speak” is essential to the full flourishing of “human mental activity.” See also	170.25	720.20166015625	9.75	318.06494140625	64

the focal categories of social and political interaction and, thereby, establish	170.25	75.82958984375	9.75	327.9258728027344	67
parameters on belief formation. Symbolic forms help delineate – in at least	170.25	87.82958984375	9.75	320.9510192871094	67
two empirically intertwined but analytically distinguishable ways – the realm	170.25	99.82958984375	9.75	327.0537109375	67
of social and political possibility for relevant actors.	170.25	111.82958984375	9.75	219.763671875	67
In the first place, symbolic forms operate indicatively to focus the	192.75	123.82958984375	9.75	279.8329162597656	67
attention of actors, directing it toward certain ranges of alternatives and	170.25	135.82958984375	9.75	305.3693542480469	67
away from others.14 They assert order, relation and predictability in the face	170.25	147.54815673828125	11.53143310546875	326.3633728027344	67
of indeterminacy (Moore and Myerhoff, 1977, 18). They foreclose	170.25	161.32958984375	9.75	279.6449279785156	67
possibilities. This process is not naive. Symbolic force discriminates. By	170.25	173.32958984375	9.75	313.46038818359375	67
calling attention to certain options, thereby defining them as viable or	170.25	185.32958984375	9.75	296.3593444824219	67
feasible, it forecloses other options. It constitutes social and political	170.25	197.32958984375	9.75	296.22552490234375	67
interactions on particular, partial terms (Lukes 1977, 68–9; Elkins and	170.25	209.32958984375	9.75	300.9445495605469	67
Simeon 1979, 128; Kertzer 1988, 87).	170.25	221.32958984375	9.75	162.06451416015625	67
If symbolic forms only operated indicatively they would have an	192.75	233.32958984375	9.75	270.1448669433594	67
unvaryingly constraining, conservative impact on social and political	170.25	245.32958984375	9.75	291.0383605957031	67
interaction. But symbols also operate subjunctively to disclose possibilities	170.25	257.32958984375	9.75	324.66119384765625	67
often not immediately discernable in mundane existence. They thus open	170.25	269.32958984375	9.75	315.85125732421875	67
options that might go otherwise unconsidered (Bruner 1986, 26,159; Turner	170.25	281.32958984375	9.75	322.645263671875	67
1987, 26–7,41–42,101). Orchestrated in cultural performances such as	170.25	293.32958984375	9.75	305.1174011230469	67
ritual, for example, symbolic forms give palpable existence to as yet	170.25	305.32958984375	9.75	294.0081787109375	67
unrealized possibility.15 They nourish the imagination of social and political	170.25	317.04815673828125	11.53143310546875	324.03668212890625	67
actors, helping to “render the world less fixed, less banal, more susceptible	170.25	330.8296203613281	9.75	324.0747375488281	67
to recreation” (Bruner, 1986, 159). Thus, this process is not naive either. By	170.25	342.8296203613281	9.75	326.27642822265625	67
imaginatively disclosing and exploring possibilities actors can, within limits,	170.25	354.8296203613281	9.75	325.4725341796875	67
redefine their options.	170.25	366.8296203613281	9.75	93.06298828125	67
Symbolic forms, then, exert force over social and political actors by	192.75	378.8296203613281	9.75	291.0011291503906	67
commanding their attention and capturing their imagination. They govern the	170.25	390.8296203613281	9.75	327.1808776855469	67
mental capacities with which actors delimit the possibilities embodied in	170.25	402.8296203613281	9.75	311.2992858886719	67
their extant situation and envision those that lie beyond it. So understood,	170.25	414.8296203613281	9.75	318.7644348144531	67
the force of symbolic forms grounds the intimate relation between symbol	170.25	426.8296203613281	9.75	316.5235595703125	67
and strategy in politics.	170.25	438.8296203613281	9.75	101.19497680664062	67
V.	170.25	463.97515869140625	18.0	17.1300048828125	68
Symbolic forms govern prevailing conceptions of possibility. They are, in	170.25	495.8296203613281	9.75	309.87481689453125	69
Charles Taylor (1985) terms, “constitutive” of practices and institutions.	170.25	507.82958984375	9.75	306.0220947265625	69
This, however, leaves us on an ambiguous theoretical terrain. On the one	170.25	519.82958984375	9.75	313.7792053222656	69
hand, possibility is not defined purely by structural causes.16 The notion of	170.25	531.548095703125	11.531494140625	322.1182556152344	69
political possibility, in particular, presumes that actors intentionally and	170.25	545.32958984375	9.75	306.80364990234375	69
deliberately endeavor to constitute the world in particular ways (Elster 1978,	170.25	557.32958984375	9.75	327.0367431640625	69
48–49). On the other hand, constituting or reconstituting the social and	170.25	569.32958984375	9.75	305.3179016113281	69
political world, disclosing or foreclosing possibilities, does not involve	170.25	581.32958984375	9.749984741210938	296.35552978515625	69
selecting or rejecting discrete, pre-defined alternatives. It is not, strictly	170.25	593.32958984375	9.75	305.9959716796875	69
14 Stinchcombe suggests that attention is “the key link between individuals and cultural	170.25	619.4014282226562	11.25	301.39056396484375	70
systems.” The force of symbolic forms on his view resides in part in their capacity to establish	170.25	633.20166015625	9.75	327.55438232421875	70
“attention structures” that provide common foci of choice and interaction (Stinchcombe	170.25	645.20166015625	9.75	308.0380859375	70
1968, 247,235–36). Thus, as Elkins and Simeon (1979, 142,127–28,131,139) put the point:	170.25	658.4014282226562	8.25	322.1849365234375	70
“Culture is unlikely to be of much help in explaining why alternative A was chosen over	170.25	670.4014282226562	8.25	303.6107482910156	70
alternative B – but it may be of great help in understanding why A and B were considered,	170.25	682.4014282226562	8.25	308.9271240234375	70
while no thought was given to C, D, or E.”	170.25	693.20166015625	9.75	147.57901000976562	70
15 “In ritual,” for example, “the world as lived and the world as imagined, fused under the	170.25	704.9014282226562	11.55023193359375	308.92889404296875	71
agency of a single set of symbolic forms, turn out to be the same world” (Geertz, 1973, 112).	170.25	718.70166015625	9.75	322.2661437988281	71
16 Even if it obviously is subject to physical and material constraints (Follesdal 1981).	170.25	730.4014282226562	11.25	299.1163024902344	72

speaking, a matter of choice (Follesdal 1981, 402). Rather, it is a matter of	170.25	63.82958984375	9.75	321.8694152832031	75
the ways political actors seek, for strategic purposes, to exploit the force	170.25	75.82958984375	9.75	314.2916564941406	75
that symbolic forms hold for relevant constituencies. How are we to	170.25	87.82958984375	9.75	288.8547058105469	75
understand the character of such symbolic action?	170.25	99.82958984375	9.75	219.0029296875	75
In the first place, symbolic action consists largely in the efforts to	192.75	111.82958984375	9.75	281.28851318359375	75
invest a symbolic form or cultural performance with particular, partial	170.25	123.82958984375	9.75	294.0423583984375	75
meaning. Relevant constituencies share symbols and the cultural	170.25	135.82958984375	9.75	282.0140380859375	75
performances in which they are orchestrated insofar as they mutually	170.25	147.82958984375	9.75	298.2698059082031	75
attribute significance to that set. However, the meanings that individuals or	170.25	159.82958984375	9.75	320.36175537109375	75
groups within the population attribute to the symbolic components of their	170.25	171.82958984375	9.75	316.58258056640625	75
culture need not be shared. Symbolic forms, not the imperfectly shared,	170.25	183.82958984375	9.75	310.5127868652344	75
occasionally idiosyncratic, frequently contested meanings attributed to	170.25	195.82958984375	9.75	304.664306640625	75
them, constitute the crucial intersubjective, public dimension of culture.	170.25	207.82958984375	9.75	306.7532958984375	75
Meanings can be shared, more or less imperfectly, within a population	192.75	219.82958984375	9.75	302.34417724609375	75
or they can verge on the idiosyncratic. Indeed political acumen is properly	170.25	231.82958984375	9.75	318.0898132324219	75
conceived less as the capacity to invent new symbols than as the ability to	170.25	243.82958984375	9.75	323.2926330566406	75
creatively recast meanings invested in existing symbolic forms (Walzer	170.25	255.82958984375	9.75	306.0873107910156	75
1967, 196). Anyone attempting such semantic improvisation necessarily will	170.25	267.82958984375	9.75	328.5241394042969	75
challenge the established meanings attributed to a symbol. And they quite	170.25	279.82958984375	9.75	321.0674743652344	75
possibly will confront discordant improvisations crafted by others. Symbolic	170.25	291.82958984375	9.75	324.7047119140625	75
forms do not simply express meaning. They enable social and political	170.25	303.82958984375	9.75	304.5138244628906	75
actors to make, remake and, in the process, contest meanings (Cohen	170.25	315.82958984375	9.75	306.5782470703125	75
1985, 15).17	170.25	327.54815673828125	11.531463623046875	52.587005615234375	75
Second, as should now be clear, symbolic action is conflictual. Tocqueville	170.25	341.3296203613281	9.75	322.57220458984375	75
brings this point home with especial force in one well known episode that he	170.25	353.3296203613281	9.75	327.8420715332031	75
recounts in his Recollections. There he recalls as follows the opening in	170.25	365.3296203613281	9.75	309.1573791503906	75
early May 1848 of the new Constituent Assembly to which he was an	170.25	377.3296203613281	9.75	298.5919494628906	75
elected delegate.	170.25	389.3296203613281	9.75	73.56599426269531	75
“I should be able to call to mind the look of that Assembly at its	192.75	413.3296203613281	9.75	274.4888916015625	76
opening, but I find that my recollection is very blurred. . . . I can	192.75	425.3296203613281	9.75	272.33880615234375	76
remember only our shouting “Long Live the Republic!” fifteen times in	192.75	437.3296203613281	9.75	294.9924011230469	76
the course of the session in competition with one another. . . . I think	192.75	449.3296203613281	9.75	297.8011474609375	76
that cry was sincere on both sides, but it stood for different, even	192.75	461.3296203613281	9.75	279.1005859375	76
contradictory thoughts. Everybody wanted to preserve the Republic,	192.75	473.3296203613281	9.75	291.7978820800781	76
but some wanted to use it for attack, and others to defend themselves	192.75	485.3296203613281	9.75	302.28179931640625	76
(Tocqueville, 1987, p. 99).”	192.75	497.3296203613281	9.75	114.83343505859375	76
Tocqueville was not a disinterested observer of this scene. Despite his	170.25	521.32958984375	9.75	303.05401611328125	77
partisanship he grants that the political factions contesting the meaning of	170.25	533.32958984375	9.75	318.82464599609375	77
‘the Republic’ were sincere.18 Delegates of the contending parties were not	170.25	545.048095703125	11.531494140625	323.314697265625	77
duplicitous; they actually interpreted ‘the Republic’ and the possibilities	170.25	558.82958984375	9.75	307.4825744628906	77
embodied in the political world in different, conflicting ways.	170.25	570.82958984375	9.75	255.78134155273438	77
17 This line of argument has a contentious implication. It suggests that we shift theoretical	170.25	644.9014282226562	11.25	315.5062255859375	78
attention away from a Durkheimian inspired preoccupation with culture as a medium of	170.25	659.9014282226562	8.25	302.10443115234375	78
integration and instead think of symbolic forms as devices for aggregating meanings (Cohen,	170.25	671.9014282226562	8.3677978515625	323.11553955078125	78
1985, 20,21). Cultural symbols do not express value consensus or shared belief (Laitin 1988).	170.25	683.9014282226562	8.25	322.34814453125	78
Indeed, symbolic forms do not so much represent or express pre-existing values and beliefs as	170.25	695.9014282226562	8.25	321.1312561035156	78
constitute the context within which individuals formulate beliefs and values. They help	170.25	707.9014282226562	8.25	299.85760498046875	78
structure belief (Cohen 1979, 98; Kertzer 1988, 68).	170.25	719.9014282226562	8.25	181.95254516601562	78

Contests of this sort are essentially strategic, part of what Geertz	192.75	63.82958984375	9.75	282.73870849609375	82
(1973, 316) calls “the struggle for the real.”19 Actors engaged in such	170.25	75.54815673828125	11.53143310546875	297.9071960449219	82
strategic contests seek, with differential facility and success, to exploit	170.25	89.32958984375	9.75	306.7015686035156	82
symbolic force in order to define the context of their ongoing interactions.	170.25	101.32958984375	9.75	315.0325927734375	82
Their objective is to establish as authoritative a particular and partial	170.25	113.32958984375	9.75	292.56793212890625	82
conception of the world and the social and political possibilities it contains.	170.25	125.32958984375	9.75	323.2344665527344	82
In the struggle for the real actors strive to command the attention and	170.25	137.32958984375	9.75	297.8631286621094	82
capture the imagination of relevant others by directing the symbolic media	170.25	149.32958984375	9.75	318.3719787597656	82
with which they think.	170.25	161.32958984375	9.75	93.71011352539062	82
Third, the struggle for the real is pervasive and inescapable. It takes	192.75	173.32958984375	9.75	291.0775146484375	82
place across a range of arenas. For example, delegates who Tocqueville	170.25	185.32958984375	9.75	311.3934020996094	82
describes mounted their struggle at center stage, publicly contesting the	170.25	197.32958984375	9.75	312.81317138671875	82
range of possibilities contained in ‘the Republic’. By contrast, peasants	170.25	209.32958984375	9.75	307.4774475097656	82
engaging in everyday forms of resistance are effective precisely because	170.25	221.32958984375	9.75	311.40167236328125	82
they do not assail the public stage. They “typically avoid any direct	170.25	233.32958984375	9.75	288.7761535644531	82
symbolic confrontation with authority.” At a more mundane, local level,	170.25	245.32958984375	9.75	303.8349609375	82
however, they too are engaged in a contest of interpretations, “a struggle	170.25	257.32958984375	9.75	312.1308288574219	82
over the appropriation of symbols . . . over how the past and present should	170.25	269.32958984375	9.75	324.1326904296875	82
be understood and labeled” (Scott 1985, xvi, xvii, 27, 178).	170.25	281.32958984375	9.75	251.31378173828125	82
The struggle for the real is inescapable, it is not a contingent aspect of	192.75	293.32958984375	9.75	303.81597900390625	82
symbolic action. Actors have both the occasion and an incentive to take	170.25	305.32958984375	9.75	310.5651550292969	82
part. Cultures afford ample opportunity for symbolic contests. Because they	170.25	317.32958984375	9.75	327.0010986328125	82
are, by definition, multivocal, symbolic forms obviously invite discordant	170.25	329.32958984375	9.750030517578125	307.55877685546875	82
interpretation. Moreover, “cultural systems” are not seamless.20 The	170.25	341.0481262207031	11.531494140625	296.84942626953125	82
interstices that they inevitably contain provide openings for semantic	170.25	354.8296203613281	9.75	294.77764892578125	82
improvisation. Symbolic forms also establish a powerful incentive to engage	170.25	366.8296203613281	9.75	324.8731994628906	82
in the struggle for the real. They do not influence thought or action	170.25	378.8296203613281	9.75	283.6507263183594	82
deterministically by directly instilling individual values, beliefs or	170.25	390.8296203613281	9.75	273.1091003417969	82
preferences.21 Symbolic force does however circumscribe the range of	170.25	402.5481262207031	11.531494140625	303.14727783203125	82
possibilities over which actors might establish values, preferences, or	170.25	416.3296203613281	9.75	298.2166748046875	82
beliefs. Moreover, symbolic force discriminates. It can focus attention on	170.25	428.3296203613281	9.75	312.0883483886719	82
certain options thereby diverting attention from others and circumscribing	170.25	440.3296203613281	9.75	313.6204528808594	82
possibility. It also can slacken the constraints of attention by sustaining	170.25	452.3296203613281	9.75	309.76898193359375	82
unrealized options in imagination. In this way it can hold out as viable or	170.25	464.3296203613281	9.75	309.8485412597656	82
feasible options that otherwise would not enter into consideration. In these	170.25	476.3296203613281	9.75	319.6047668457031	82
ways symbolic force sustains particular conceptions of political possibility	170.25	488.3296203613281	9.75	319.45892333984375	82
at the expense of others.22	170.25	500.0481262207031	11.531494140625	117.08700561523438	82
The struggle for the real occupies the nexus of symbol and strategy.	192.75	513.82958984375	9.75	294.75897216796875	82
What is at stake in this struggle are political possibilities and the symbolic	170.25	525.82958984375	9.75	322.4452819824219	82
forms that govern how actors entertain them. The struggle for the real, then,	170.25	537.82958984375	9.75	325.5701904296875	82
19 When speaking of symbolic action anthropologists regularly use metaphors of	170.25	569.9014282226562	11.25	281.091064453125	83
“management”, “strategy ”, “bargaining” and “negotiation.” For examples and discussion see	170.25	583.70166015625	9.75	319.4621276855469	83
Johnson (1991). Metaphors are not merely literary embellishments. They structure social and	170.25	596.9014282226562	8.25	323.8681335449219	83
political inquiry. The metaphors that interpretive theorists deploy provide warrant for	170.25	608.9014282226562	8.25	299.7824401855469	83
pursuing the unexamined strategic dimensions of “symbolic action.”	170.25	619.70166015625	9.75	234.57901000976562	83
20 The extent of their internal coherence and interconnectedness is an empirical question	170.25	631.4014282226562	11.25	311.0899658203125	84
(Geertz, 1973, 18,406–407; Turner 1974, 163). It is very important not to prejudge the	170.25	646.4014282226562	8.25	306.4826965332031	84
extent of this internal coherence (Barth 1989).	170.25	658.4014282226562	8.25	163.9859619140625	84

Symbolic force operates in the first instance to establish the focal categories of political	170.25	683.9014282226562	8.25	304.3324279785156	85
interaction (Laitin 1988; Myerson, 1992) rather than to define values or preferences	170.25	695.9014282226562	8.25	293.84075927734375	85
(Wildavsky 1987;1988;1992).	170.25	707.9014282226562	8.25	105.51626586914062	85

some of the vicissitudes and constraints to which participants in this	170.25	75.82958984375	9.75	295.47998046875	89
struggle are subject.	170.25	87.82958984375	9.75	88.49221801757812	89
VI.	170.25	112.97515869140625	18.0	22.337997436523438	90
The struggle for the real is a struggle over possibility. It is a struggle for	170.25	144.82958984375	9.75	305.36029052734375	91
power. More precisely, it is a struggle for power over others, a contest to	170.25	156.82958984375	9.75	312.1701354980469	91
control the media, the symbols and cultural performances, in terms of which	170.25	168.82958984375	9.75	327.8271179199219	91
social and political actors conceive possibilities and fashion them into viable	170.25	180.82958984375	9.75	327.0889892578125	91
alternatives. The intimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics pivots	170.25	192.82958984375	9.75	316.60919189453125	91
around possibility, feasibility and power.	170.25	204.82958984375	9.75	171.78277587890625	91
Recall that the notion of political possibility presupposes that agents	192.75	216.82958984375	9.75	295.4866943359375	91
intentionally and deliberately seek to constitute the world in particular ways.	170.25	228.82958984375	9.75	327.74365234375	91
Intentional action is the product of “two successive filtering devices” (Elster,	170.25	240.82958984375	9.75	324.78155517578125	91
1979, 113, 77). The first filter specifies the “feasible set” by circumscribing	170.25	252.82958984375	9.75	318.8359680175781	91
the range of abstractly possible alternatives. The feasible set, then,	170.25	264.82958984375	9.75	289.53302001953125	91
consists of those options genuinely available to actors. The second filter is	170.25	276.82958984375	9.75	321.7657470703125	91
the process through which actors choose from among the options in the	170.25	288.82958984375	9.75	309.8436584472656	91
feasible set.	170.25	300.82958984375	9.75	52.484893798828125	91
Strategic actors regularly contest the context of their interactions –	192.75	312.82958984375	9.75	289.6709899902344	91
including the prevailing set of feasible options that it makes available	170.25	324.82958984375	9.750030517578125	294.1256408691406	91
(Schelling 1960). Moreover, what often is at stake in such contests are the	170.25	336.8296203613281	9.75	321.04376220703125	91
symbolic media through which others envision possibilities and identify	170.25	348.8296203613281	9.75	305.2660217285156	91
some subset of conceivable options as feasible.	170.25	360.8296203613281	9.75	206.29669189453125	91
“After all, options are not just opened or closed. They are essentially	192.75	384.8296203613281	9.75	295.5226745605469	92
seen to be open or closed, and crucially seen so under particular	192.75	396.8296203613281	9.75	279.8529357910156	92
descriptions, descriptions that can themselves motivate or inhibit	192.75	408.8296203613281	9.75	279.7535400390625	92
action. . . . What one cannot envisage is difficult to choose (Rorty,	192.75	420.8296203613281	9.75	286.49493408203125	92
1988, 337–38).”	192.75	432.8296203613281	9.75	68.209228515625	92
In any situation the “feasible” as distinct from “merely conceivable” options	170.25	456.8296203613281	9.75	320.3089904785156	93
are a function of what actors consider “obvious,” what they “take for granted”	170.25	468.8296203613281	9.75	327.1349182128906	93
and there is no general criterion for differentiating genuinely feasible from	170.25	480.8296203613281	9.75	312.09063720703125	93
abstractly possible options (Schwartz 1986, 224–228). The way this	170.25	492.8296203613281	9.75	293.3183898925781	93
distinction is drawn in particular settings is a question of power.	170.25	504.82958984375	9.75	274.51861572265625	93
Power is a relational concept. When agents exercise power they	192.75	516.82958984375	9.75	279.0108337402344	93
necessarily exercise it over others. In particular, they aim to define the set	170.25	528.82958984375	9.75	320.2613220214844	93
of feasible options that others consider when determining how to act.23	170.25	540.548095703125	11.531494140625	306.0870056152344	93
Thus, power differs from persuasion which aims to modify how others	170.25	554.32958984375	9.75	297.8236999511719	93
evaluate alternatives. It does not directly alter another’s preferences or	170.25	566.32958984375	9.75	301.64447021484375	93
beliefs regarding available options. Similarly, power differs from force which	170.25	578.32958984375	9.749984741210938	321.15924072265625	93
aims to eliminate choice on the part of those subjected to it by physically	170.25	590.32958984375	9.75	317.22161865234375	93
narrowing their feasible set to a single option. Power need not involve	170.25	602.32958984375	9.75	296.4125061035156	93
physical constraint. It aims to influence the way others to choose a	170.25	614.32958984375	9.75	289.5485534667969	93
particular course of action by modifying the alternatives available to them.	170.25	626.32958984375	9.75	316.6030578613281	93
Power can work by altering the incentive structure that actors face. It	192.75	638.32958984375	9.75	297.0231018066406	93
consists, in such instances, of negative or positive inducements, threats or	170.25	650.32958984375	9.75	322.5655212402344	93
offers. But power need not involve such inducements at all. Indeed, actors	170.25	662.32958984375	9.75	318.0683288574219	93
can exercise power in strategic situations simply by credibly leading others	170.25	674.32958984375	9.75	325.4736022949219	93
to expect that they will choose a particular course of action (Taylor 1982,	170.25	686.32958984375	9.75	315.01568603515625	93
23 The discussion in this paragraph is indebted to the typology presented by Taylor (1982,	170.25	718.4014282226562	11.25	314.82061767578125	94

12–13,145). Actors who can successfully coordinate the expectations of a	170.25	63.82958984375	9.75	319.5667419433594	97
relevant constituency often can generate the sort of collective action needed	170.25	75.82958984375	9.75	327.1523742675781	97
to sustain selective inducements in the first place (Hardin 1990, 363,366–	170.25	87.82958984375	9.75	317.4209899902344	97
69).	170.25	99.82958984375	9.75	16.012344360351562	97
Coordination, however, is typically as much a matter of expectations	192.75	111.82958984375	9.75	295.5159606933594	98
as incentives. Strategic actors can mutually coordinate their expectations	170.25	123.82958984375	9.75	317.96051025390625	98
only by focusing attention on one among a range of alternatives. They must	170.25	135.82958984375	9.75	324.81549072265625	98
create a “focal point” by endowing that option with prominence and this, in	170.25	147.82958984375	9.75	318.1049499511719	98
any given instance, typically is a product of “imagination” (Schelling 1960,	170.25	159.82958984375	9.75	318.0214538574219	98
58). Strategic actors create focal points through symbolic action. They	170.25	171.82958984375	9.75	304.5024108886719	98
invest seemingly extra-strategic particularities with significance, thereby	170.25	183.82958984375	9.75	310.47784423828125	98
transforming them into symbols whose force coordinates social and political	170.25	195.82958984375	9.75	327.75823974609375	98
interaction.24 They exercise power over others by symbolically structuring	170.25	207.54815673828125	11.53143310546875	318.3221740722656	98
their expectations. Power in this sense, operates “along the cognitive	170.25	221.32958984375	9.75	297.84375	98
dimension” (Lukes 1977, 68; Turner 1974, 134).	170.25	233.32958984375	9.75	204.8353271484375	98
Power may be malign. “It might be said that the main function of a	192.75	245.32958984375	9.75	284.34185791015625	98
system of domination is” to foreclose options, “to define what is realistic	170.25	257.32958984375	9.75	310.5178527832031	98
and what is not realistic and to drive certain goals and aspirations into the	170.25	269.32958984375	9.75	317.3416748046875	98
realm of the impossible, the realm of idle dreams, of wishful thinking” (Scott	170.25	281.32958984375	9.75	325.5294189453125	98
1985, 326). Symbolically constituted attention structures can be highly	170.25	293.32958984375	9.75	305.9704895019531	98
inhibiting. They foreclose possibilities By defining alternatives to existing	170.25	305.32958984375	9.75	311.3456115722656	98
arrangements as infeasible such attention structures can prevent	170.25	317.32958984375	9.75	279.7861633300781	98
subordinate actors from recognizing, much less pursuing a range of	170.25	329.32958984375	9.750030517578125	290.36993408203125	98
possibilities. On the other hand, even oppositional groups need to	170.25	341.3296203613281	9.75	282.27313232421875	98
circumscribe possibilities.25 They rely on attention structures to coordinate	170.25	353.0481262207031	11.531494140625	323.3565979003906	98
their activities and potentially to divert more powerful groups. This is	170.25	366.8296203613281	9.75	291.8117980957031	98
precisely the strategy that the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, for example,	170.25	378.8296203613281	9.75	322.4955139160156	98
adopted when they both occupied the symbolic center of Argentine politics	170.25	390.8296203613281	9.75	322.4889831542969	98
(the Plaza from which they took their name) and did so as mothers.	170.25	402.8296203613281	9.75	291.7683410644531	98
Disclosing possibilities is a similarly equivocal process. Contesting the	192.75	414.8296203613281	9.75	305.3038024902344	98
bounds of political possibility crucially presumes that actors can imagine	170.25	426.8296203613281	9.75	313.6706848144531	98
alternatives precluded by extant definitions of the political world.	170.25	438.8296203613281	9.75	275.2886047363281	98
Subordinate actors are adept at this sort of symbolic action. In particular,	170.25	450.8296203613281	9.75	315.7518005371094	98
they demonstrate a remarkable propensity to symbolically reverse (and	170.25	462.8296203613281	9.75	306.11358642578125	98
thereby expose the conventional character of) prevailing social and political	170.25	474.8296203613281	9.75	322.5789794921875	98
arrangements (Scott 1985, 331). But if such symbolic action is pervasive, it	170.25	486.8296203613281	9.75	324.76251220703125	98
also underscores the observation that “in matters of social constitution the	170.25	498.8296203613281	9.75	319.5829162597656	98
field of possibilities is much wider than the people within each society	170.25	510.82958984375	9.75	300.7562255859375	98
imagine” (Tocqueville 1987, 76).26 Symbolic reversals often are little more	170.25	522.548095703125	11.531494140625	315.89794921875	98
24 In strategic situations not just incentive structures but “the aesthetic properties, the	170.25	559.4014282226562	11.25	299.7464904785156	99
historical properties, the legal and moral properties, the cultural properties, and all the other	170.25	574.4014282226562	8.25	320.0631408691406	99
suggestive and connotative details, can serve to focus the expectations of certain participants	170.25	586.4014282226562	8.25	322.3750915527344	99
on certain solutions” (Schelling 1960, 113).	170.25	597.20166015625	9.75	151.93673706054688	99
25 Circumstances in which “all is possible” are extraordinary. They are fleeting at best. The	170.25	608.9014282226562	11.55023193359375	317.77923583984375	100
telling characterization of such circumstances as “moments of madness” (Zolberg 1972)	170.25	622.70166015625	9.75	304.3356018066406	100
specifies precisely the sorts of conceptual constraint that prevents participants from	170.25	635.9014282226562	8.25	293.010498046875	100
sustaining them.	170.25	647.9014282226562	8.25	56.11830139160156	100
26 This sort of constrained imagination is not characteristic solely of symbolic reversals. “At	170.25	658.4014282226562	11.25	323.7779541015625	101
this moment several countries in Eastern Europe . . . have or about to venture into the	170.25	673.4014282226562	8.25	299.7815246582031	101
greatest experiment in history since t he forced Stalinist industrialization of 1929. . . . the	170.25	685.4014282226562	8.25	308.8336486816406	101
economic transformations envisaged in these countries ironically mirror the Communist	170.25	697.4014282226562	8.25	305.7532043457031	101
project. . . . They are radical: They are intended to turn upside down all the existing social	170.25	709.4014282226562	8.25	311.1016845703125	101
relations. And they offer a single panacea, which once waved will cure all ills. Replace	170.25	721.4014282226562	8.25	295.4512634277344	101
‘nationalization of the means of production’ by ‘private property’ and ‘plan’ by ‘market’ and	170.25	733.4014282226562	8.25	326.07891845703125	101

Johnson The Politics of Possibility	283.5	780.95166015625	9.75	139.437255859375	103
than that. They do not so much project an alternative set of arrangements	170.25	63.82958984375	9.75	318.06134033203125	104
as, by reversing existing relations of dependency, inequity or injustice,	170.25	75.82958984375	9.75	303.75921630859375	104
depict and promote their opposite (Hirschman 1982, 95; Rorty 1988 338).	170.25	87.82958984375	9.75	315.0850830078125	104
Actors who imaginatively explore unrealized possibilities confront	192.75	99.82958984375	9.75	280.5229187011719	104
serious hazards even if they manage to transcend this sort of ubiquitous	170.25	111.82958984375	9.75	311.288330078125	104
constraint. Most obviously they might intentionally disregard or otherwise	170.25	123.82958984375	9.75	314.49859619140625	104
neglect pragmatic or material constraints (Follesdal 1981). Thinking back to	170.25	135.82958984375	9.75	325.5906677246094	104
the example with which I opened the paper, the symbolic power that	170.25	147.82958984375	9.75	294.0450439453125	104
Solidarity could command was dramatically inadequate in the face of the	170.25	159.82958984375	9.75	312.843505859375	104
overwhelming military force that the regime mustered. Thus, in the spring of	170.25	171.82958984375	9.75	324.1002502441406	104
1982, one Polish worker lamented: “We’ve got all the symbols, and they’ve	170.25	183.82958984375	9.75	321.8519592285156	104
got all the guns and tanks.”27 Actors who neglect such material constraints	170.25	195.54815673828125	11.53143310546875	326.2154235839844	104
divert energy and resources into “futile exercises,” flights of fancy that at	170.25	209.32958984375	9.75	311.23858642578125	104
best are compensatory. They encourage fantasy or utopian thinking in the	170.25	221.32958984375	9.75	318.1033020019531	104
pejorative sense (Rorty 1988, 341).28	170.25	233.04815673828125	11.53143310546875	159.83700561523438	104
Political actors face additional risks even where they pursue “genuine”	192.75	246.82958984375	9.75	300.8698425292969	104
possibilities, alternatives that are viable in the sense of being broadly	170.25	258.82958984375	9.75	296.3542175292969	104
consonant with pragmatic or material constraints. They might simply fail to	170.25	270.82958984375	9.75	321.8077087402344	104
realize possible objectives. As with all intentional action, a gap always	170.25	282.82958984375	9.75	303.7489013671875	104
looms between attempt and accomplishment. Conversely, having realized	170.25	294.82958984375	9.75	317.4209899902344	104
alternative possibilities, relevant actors might encounter a significant gap	170.25	306.82958984375	9.75	312.11810302734375	104
between the reality achieved and the possibility held out. Either eventuality	170.25	318.82958984375	9.75	321.78985595703125	104
can breed disappointment and resignation (Hirschman 1982, 94; Rorty	170.25	330.8296203613281	9.75	303.0471496582031	104
1988, 338). Either eventuality, may, in that sense, reinforce the sense of	170.25	342.8296203613281	9.75	311.3330078125	104
inevitability that enshrouds the extant political world.	170.25	354.8296203613281	9.75	225.02130126953125	104
VII.	170.25	379.97515869140625	18.0	27.567001342773438	105
The argument of this paper has been circuitous. I have argued that grappling	170.25	411.8296203613281	9.75	327.1566467285156	106
with the subject of political possibility requires that we examine the intimate	170.25	423.8296203613281	9.75	326.9602355957031	106
relation of symbol and strategy in politics. I have drawn a crucial distinction	170.25	435.8296203613281	9.75	323.3250732421875	106
between the ways that the ability to calculate probabilities and to entertain	170.25	447.8296203613281	9.75	320.31451416015625	106
possibilities enters into social and political interaction. I have identified the	170.25	459.8296203613281	9.75	318.8323059082031	106
mechanisms – attention and imagination – at work in the ways symbolic	170.25	471.8296203613281	9.75	312.70458984375	106
forms govern our ability to envision possibilities. I have shown how political	170.25	483.8296203613281	9.75	320.3193664550781	106
possibility is implicated with power. And I have sketched some of the	170.25	495.8296203613281	9.75	297.07769775390625	106
constraints and vicissitudes that make the politics of possibility a	170.25	507.82958984375	9.75	281.3493957519531	106
precarious enterprise. I now want briefly to connect my preceding argument	170.25	519.82958984375	9.75	324.80279541015625	106
to the theme of antipolitics. I will make three short assertions.	170.25	531.82958984375	9.75	266.9866638183594	106
1. Antipolitics, whether conducted by formally organized collective	192.75	543.82958984375	9.75	284.3483581542969	106
entities like Solidarity or by looser groupings of individuals like the Mothers	170.25	555.82958984375	9.75	322.5512390136719	106
of the Plaza, is implicated in the politics of possibility. Parties to antipolitics	170.25	567.82958984375	9.75	327.6915588378906	106
deploy symbolic forms with greater or lesser facility and success and they	170.25	579.82958984375	9.749984741210938	320.9852600097656	106
do so for strategic purposes. They aim to redefine the political world by	170.25	591.82958984375	9.75	306.0648193359375	106
recasting the bounds of political possibility in particular and partial ways.	170.25	603.82958984375	9.75	313.4992370605469	106
you can leave the structure of the ideology intact. Perhaps revolutions are shaped by the very	170.25	646.4014282226562	8.25	323.7618408203125	107
systems against which they are directed?” (Przeworski 1991, 7).	170.25	657.20166015625	9.75	221.79583740234375	107
27 Reported by Laba (1991, 148).	170.25	668.9014282226562	11.25	118.30999755859375	108
28 This discussion minimally requires that we differentiate imagination from fantasy.	170.25	682.4014282226562	11.25	294.6150817871094	109
Imagination is concerned with fashioning genuine, viable, if unrealized, alternatives. Fantasy	170.25	697.4014282226562	8.25	318.55126953125	109
inclines toward the “merely possible,” toward options that, while conceivable, remain	170.25	708.20166015625	9.75	295.3442687988281	109
“incredible” and consequently unrealizable (Rorty 1988, 340–41; Wittgenstin 1967, para.	170.25	720.20166015625	9.75	310.99371337890625	109

2. Antipolitics, insofar as it is concerned with possibilities, is a strategy in	170.25	63.82958984375	9.75	318.0040283203125	112
the struggle for power. This may seem peculiar given the aversion of	170.25	75.82958984375	9.75	292.3683166503906	112
spokesmen like Konrad to power politics. He claims that the “medium of	170.25	87.82958984375	9.75	311.31103515625	112
politics is power over people – power backed by weapons” (Konrad 1984,	170.25	99.82958984375	9.75	314.34356689453125	112
16). And he asserts that “No thinking person should want to drive others	170.25	111.82958984375	9.75	310.547119140625	112
from positions of political power in order to occupy them himself” (Konrad	170.25	123.82958984375	9.75	314.4087829589844	112
1984, 119). Yet since antipolitics of the sort in which Solidarity or the	170.25	135.82958984375	9.75	297.8045959472656	112
Mothers of the Plaza engage entails participation in the “struggle for the	170.25	147.82958984375	9.75	308.3554992675781	112
real”, this suspicion of power is simply misplaced.29	170.25	159.54815673828125	11.53143310546875	225.08700561523438	112
3. It is easy to find pessimists, those who view the struggle for the real	192.75	173.32958984375	9.75	304.543701171875	112
and the efforts to redefine political possibility that it entails as inherently	170.25	185.32958984375	9.75	309.75567626953125	112
dangerous. But it is not easy to find alternatives. In politics symbol and	170.25	197.32958984375	9.75	306.0586853027344	112
strategy are related in inescapable ways. So, for example, the invention of	170.25	209.32958984375	9.75	318.9335632324219	112
traditions is a pervasive strategic move in politics.30 But observers of	170.25	221.04815673828125	11.53143310546875	295.06756591796875	112
politics in post-communist East Central Europe typically express suspicion	170.25	234.82958984375	9.75	324.8050231933594	112
of political actors who invoke tradition (Gyani 1993; Jaworski 1985). They	170.25	246.82958984375	9.75	313.875	112
rarely consider whether, in such highly indeterminant political	170.25	258.82958984375	9.75	264.0140380859375	112
circumstances, it might be possible to invent normatively appealing	170.25	270.82958984375	9.75	288.85479736328125	112
traditions. I have in mind here, for instance, a tradition of constitutionalism	170.25	282.82958984375	9.75	318.77880859375	112
(Johnson 1994). We must, as the brochure for this conference suggests, be	170.25	294.82958984375	9.75	326.40618896484375	112
wary of antipolitical mobilizations that threaten to derail the emergence or	170.25	306.82958984375	9.75	315.848876953125	112
stability of liberal democratic political arrangements. However, the most	170.25	318.82958984375	9.75	308.2713623046875	112
effective response to such mobilizations is to engage in the politics of	170.25	330.8296203613281	9.75	299.3305969238281	112
possibility. And this means recognizing the need to effectively exercise the	170.25	342.8296203613281	9.75	322.5655517578125	112
power that emerges at the intersection of symbol and strategy.	170.25	354.8296203613281	9.75	271.5079040527344	112
29 It may be more appropriate to say that Konrad really is opposed to force as a final	170.25	644.9014282226562	11.3677978515625	296.9261779785156	113
guarantor of political arrangements. But we should not let his invocation of “spiritual	170.25	659.9014282226562	8.25	294.5987854003906	113
authority” or “moral opposition” (Konrad 1984, 119,122) blind us to the fact that	170.25	670.70166015625	9.75	288.4341735839844	113
antipolitics is part of the “struggle for the real” and hence is a struggle for power. Both	170.25	682.70166015625	9.75	300.4715576171875	113
Solidarity and the Mothers of the Plaza invoked spiritual authority in the face of authoritarian	170.25	695.9014282226562	8.25	326.8056640625	113
rule. But they did so in hopes of expanding the range of political possibilities beyond those	170.25	707.9014282226562	8.25	312.6224670410156	113
sanctioned by extant political arrangements.	170.25	719.9014282226562	8.25	152.88104248046875	113
