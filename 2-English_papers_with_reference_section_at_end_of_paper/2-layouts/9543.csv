Abstract: The aim of this essay is to discuss the places of the notions of subjectivity and reflexivity	144.6999969482422	180.79248046875	9.247314453125	394.71827697753906	5
within International Relations (IR) theory by contrasting the classical perspective inspired by	144.6999969482422	194.99249267578125	9.0	367.2091827392578	5
positivism with a dialogical perspective which tries to fully integrate these notions in its examination	144.6999969482422	209.092529296875	9.0	395.82923889160156	5
of the specific nexus between identity and alterity. This dialogical perspective proposes a reflexive	144.6999969482422	223.29248046875	9.0	391.5181427001953	5
tool, the hermeneutical locus, which is intended to provide a way to assess the subjectivity of the	144.6999969482422	237.39251708984375	9.0	386.3430938720703	5
cognised without falling into reification and a reflexive archaeology of the discipline of IR itself. In	144.6999969482422	251.592529296875	9.0	385.9290313720703	5
this sense, a dialogical approach wishes to offer a reflexive tool for and on IR theory.	144.6999969482422	265.6925048828125	9.0	338.21116638183594	5

Mikhail M. BAKHTIN's work, thus wishes to provide an epistemic framework to	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	381.78773498535156	20

Reflexivity and subjectivity are in effect fundamental problematics to those	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	361.54774475097656	21

such as postmodernism, which, in the words of Alexander WENDT (1999,	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	359.96372985839844	21

Postmodernism gives us no insight into why this is so, and indeed, rejects the	167.39999389648438	490.93609619140625	10.0	340.5598449707031	22

Dialogism represents an answer to WENDT's challenge for "a theory that takes	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	386.2428741455078	23

Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory	144.6999969482422	61.24884033203125	8.0	334.1439971923828	27
BRUBAKER & COOPER 2000). Moreover, reflexivity and subjectivity are an	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	370.4137725830078	28
actual problematic as they are related to both cognised and cognisant agents	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	376.58497619628906	28
(whether individually or collectively) in the three different levels constituting the	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	382.55775451660156	28
scientific framework. This essay therefore wishes to address these three following	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	399.23402404785156	28
levels: (i) the level of the cognised "objects" (we will see that this term itself is	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	376.40870666503906	28
questionable) in their subjective interrelations as agents within political, social,	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0162353515625	380.02186584472656	28
economical, and historical structures; (ii) the level of the scientific research itself,	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	392.55665588378906	28
the reflexive and subjective relations the cognisant "subject" entertains with the	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0162353515625	385.52796936035156	28
cognised "object"; (iii) the level of the reflexive and intersubjective interactions	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0162353515625	379.1230010986328	28
between cognisant "subjects". Dialogism, as we will see, precisely offers a model	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	395.07582092285156	28
to understand or, at least, problematise each levels either within their own	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	359.3477020263672	28
dimensions or in their interrelating ones. [5]	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	211.2469940185547	28
In order to bring about this threefold connection, I will first discuss the traditional	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	389.69679260253906	29
positivist frame adopted by most IR scholars and situate the notions of reflexivity	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	392.44679260253906	29
and subjectivity in relation to it. This will lead me to tackle the first level mentioned	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	398.84877014160156	29
above and call attention to the subjective quality of the cognised, especially when	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	396.0989532470703	29
the latter is problematised as an identity. I will then introduce the foundation of a	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	390.1918487548828	29
dialogical approach in IR which specifically attempts to integrate the notion of	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	376.19972229003906	29
identity as a specific factor in international relations while embodying the notions	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	391.36891174316406	29
of reflexivity and subjectivity at the core of its epistemological concerns notably by	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	398.94789123535156	29
underlining the transgredient character between identity and alterity. In the	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	362.87879943847656	29
second section, I will introduce the two other levels of the scientific inquiry by	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	374.32972717285156	29
stressing the need to develop a processual/relational approach of IR theory in	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	378.88392639160156	29
order to avoid as much as possible the risk of reification existing in the passage	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	387.6508331298828	29
from the first to the second level and to conduct a reflexive assessment of one's	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	389.56495666503906	29
own discipline, such as IR theory, by considering it as a site of cultural practice.	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	386.58375549316406	29
Dialogism is thus presented as a reflexive tool for and on IR theory, through the	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	387.7829132080078	29
hermeneutical locus it creates, with all its epistemological consequences either in	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	395.74696350097656	29
the relations the cognisant entertains toward the cognised or the cognisant	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	364.2209014892578	29
toward other cognisant. [6]	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	130.2469940185547	29
2. International Relations Theory, the Question of the Identity-Alterity	144.6999969482422	560.5530395507812	12.0	392.61634826660156	30
Nexus, and the Dialogical Approach of International Relations	157.39999389648438	574.653076171875	12.000015258789062	352.14031982421875	30
Traditionally, IR theory only focalised on the two main factors (interest and power)	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	398.80494689941406	31
that were deemed to causally explain what was considered to be at the core of	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	382.62391662597656	31
the discipline: war and peace. Up to the end of the 1980s, the main trend within	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	386.81495666503906	31
IR theory was to address these factors within a positivist frame regarding natural	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	392.57887268066406	31
sciences as the way to follow if one wanted to do "real" science. Contrary to most	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.01617431640625	396.27491760253906	31
social sciences, IR only lately fully integrated another possible "explanatory"	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	369.8418731689453	31
factor—identity—to its general theoretical framework, finally avoiding it and	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	365.4307403564453	31
dismissing it as secondary as it used to within traditional perspectives. This	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	365.6177520751953	31
emergence, as illustrated in several contributions (see for instance LAPID &	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	369.76478576660156	31
KRATOCHWIL 1996; KATZENSTEIN 1996), partly enabled IR scholars to rethink	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	397.3920440673828	31
the epistemological and methodological dimensions of their field by stressing out	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	392.92298889160156	31
more saliently the question of identity, without actually threatening the more	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	368.3677520751953	31
traditional approaches, thus reconsidering a usually unproblematised element of	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	390.6840362548828	31

IR theory: the ways to assess the object of study. This section will first present	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	381.38075256347656	34
the traditional developments in IR concerning the notions of subjectivity and	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	368.87379455566406	34
reflexivity and then introduce dialogism as an alternative perspective for IR to	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	376.15577697753906	34
approach both these notions in function of a specific factor, identity, and the three	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	398.01295471191406	34
dimensions characterising the scientific inquiry. [7]	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	245.54701232910156	34
As mentioned, IR theory for long has been based upon a perspective that only	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	381.4910430908203	35
interest and power were at the heart of any explanation, or even understanding,	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	388.34400939941406	35
of the international world. This foundation is the result of a disciplinary "debate" in	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	397.3858184814453	35
IR between the so-called "idealists" and the emerging "realists" during the	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	359.76585388183594	35
interwar period. As the (realist) naming suggests (see CARR 1939), the formers	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	389.7188262939453	35
were deemed to provide a normative, utopian, ought-to-be perspective on world	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	388.1680450439453	35
politics, based on the ground that ideas/norms were at the heart of international	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	387.72792053222656	35
relations (e.g. WILSON's fourteen points1). The latter, however, were depicted, in	144.6999969482422	291.4591064453125	11.62060546875	395.6850128173828	35
a debate that was mainly constructed by them (see THIES 2002), as providing a	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	391.0608673095703	35
"realist" and "objective" perspective on world politics, taken the international world	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	398.2769317626953	35
as it is in its anarchic and conflictual dimensions and not as the "idealists" wished	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	395.47193908691406	35
it could be, a non "zero-sum" game in which conflicting national interests can be	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	389.8728790283203	35
resolve through the rule of law (see BROWN 2001, pp.21-30). In his definition of	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	391.8087921142578	35
political realism, Hans J. MORGENTHAU (1967, p.4, my emphasis), the founding	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	396.31886291503906	35
father of post-war realism, synthesised what was at stake in the development of	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	388.6958770751953	35
the discipline at that time and the subsequent basic epistemological driving lines	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	390.9619903564453	35
which were to be adopted by most IR scholars since then, whether "realist" or not.	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	399.40992736816406	35
"Political realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by	167.39999389648438	448.5361022949219	10.014739990234375	334.79998779296875	36
objective laws that have their roots in human nature. In order to improve society it is	167.39999389648438	462.6361083984375	10.014739990234375	367.4997253417969	36
first necessary to understand the laws by which society lives. The operation of these	167.39999389648438	476.8360900878906	10.014739990234375	368.9599304199219	36
laws being impervious to our preferences, men will challenge them only at the risk of	167.39999389648438	490.9508361816406	10.0	370.7697448730469	36
failure. Realism [...] must also believe in the possibility of developing a rational theory	167.39999389648438	505.1361083984375	10.0147705078125	373.1999816894531	36
that reflects, however imperfectly and one-sidedly, these objective laws. It believes	167.39999389648438	519.236083984375	10.0147705078125	362.4999084472656	36
also, then, in the possibility of distinguishing in politics between truth and opinion—	167.39999389648438	533.4360961914062	10.01470947265625	362.8999938964844	36
between what is true objectively and rationally, supported by evidence and illuminated	167.39999389648438	547.5361328125	10.0	376.0599060058594	36
by reason, and what is only a subjective judgment, divorced from the facts as they	167.39999389648438	561.736083984375	10.0	360.4997863769531	36
are and informed by prejudice and wishful thinking." [8]	167.39999389648438	575.8360595703125	10.0	241.16998291015625	36
According to MORGENTHAU, then, all IR scholar should follow a positivist-	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	366.5746307373047	37
empiricist perspective according to which the objects cognised are metaphysically	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	398.6289825439453	37
detached from their linguistic and theoretical assessment by the cognisant. What	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	394.2179718017578	37
matters for such a perspective is the correspondence between the signifiers used	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	396.8689727783203	37
by the cognisant and the referents, objectively rendered by the signifiers, deemed	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	398.08998107910156	37
to be existing independently from the formers. Observation, experimentation,	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	374.49098205566406	37
falsidical testing and the judgement of history are among the many ways by which	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	398.9699249267578	37
theories can be measured as correspondent to the truth of external reality. This	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	386.66090393066406	37
monistic metaphysic implies that as there is one world "out there", there can only	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	393.44789123535156	37

"The main signpost that helps political realism to find its way through the landscape of	167.39999389648438	151.33612060546875	10.0	376.5699157714844	42
international politics is the concept of interest defined in terms of power. This concept	167.39999389648438	165.53607177734375	10.0	374.7697448730469	42
provides the link between reason trying to understand international politics and the	167.39999389648438	179.6361083984375	10.0	361.4598693847656	42

From its realist birth then, the discipline of IR has been trying to reach a	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	349.1398162841797	43
"scientific", and thus honourable, status within social sciences, a drive that was	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	384.46083068847656	43
mainly and until quite recently embodied in the attempt to do and be as "real	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	371.72291564941406	43
science" does and is. By "real science" it was usually and effortlessly meant	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	369.2918243408203	43
natural sciences and their positivist/rationalist approach in addition to a tendency	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	393.17286682128906	43
to only adopt quantitative and/or formal methods. Far from rejecting a priori any	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0162353515625	387.4120635986328	43
"positivist" approach in IR, I support that IR theory should not bluntly strive to	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	374.3737335205078	43
attain a "positivist" and thus "scientific" status by focalising on what might well be	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	393.97584533691406	43
an aporia for many aspects of international relations. Social sciences cannot	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	371.9978790283203	43
become like the natural sciences even though they might well be inspired	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	357.04881286621094	43
methodologically by them. "Positivist" approaches to international relations have	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	389.7628936767578	43
in effect proved to be feasible, necessary and, often, relevant. Recent analysis of	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	395.11988830566406	43
fundamental topics such as war or national identity, however, showed that there	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	388.89393615722656	43
is a demand for different and/or complementary approaches as Erik RINGMAR	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	385.28590393066406	43
(1996) and Rodney B. HALL (1999) underlined in their recent books which	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	361.76783752441406	43
focused on this other fundamental factor of international relations: identity. If the	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	390.19178771972656	43
positivist quest thus was highly understandable, it missed, however, one simple,	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	389.7959747314453	43
yet major, flaw in such a drive: natural sciences do not deal with self-conscious	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	384.63685607910156	43
and reflexive subjects.2 [10]	144.6999969482422	560.359130859375	11.62054443359375	134.2469940185547	43
We can now sort out what are the traditional places held by the notions of	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	358.8198699951172	44
subjectivity and reflexivity within IR following MORGENTHAU's statements,	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	365.72752380371094	44
perfectly reflecting the three tenets of positivism which remains the main	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	352.72569274902344	44
conscious or unconscious epistemic framework used by IR scholars (see	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	355.31080627441406	44
NEUFELD 1995, pp.22-38). The first tenet is that of "truth as correspondence"	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	381.7090606689453	44
which affirms the validity of positive knowledge by its objective correspondence to	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	398.1559600830078	44
the external and observable world. What is at stake here is the assumed	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	353.36378479003906	44
separation between the cognised (the object, the external reality) and the	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	356.7958221435547	44
cognisant (the subject). The notion of objectivity, following MORGENTHAU and	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	386.8367462158203	44
most of the "positivist" literature in IR, refers here to one of its possible	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	343.8376922607422	44
definitions: the "quality of what exist independently of any knowledge or idea"	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	375.97987365722656	44
2 It might be arguable, however, that small parts of the natural sciences (in its most	144.6999969482422	756.5924682617188	9.0	339.70216369628906	45
encompassing acceptation) deal with self-conscious and reflexive subjects (such as the	158.8000030517578	766.5924682617188	9.0	350.30711364746094	45
primatologists with the pigmy chimps Bonobo for instance).	158.8000030517578	776.4924926757812	9.000003814697266	236.25901794433594	45

(NADEAU 1999, p.451). The second tenet is also linked to the idea of objectivity	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	391.26991271972656	48
but in its definition as "the quality of one who sees things the way they are without	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	398.4419708251953	48
being influenced by its preferences or habits" (NADEAU 1999, p.451). In the idea	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	395.88990783691406	48
of the value-free nature of scientific knowledge resides the objective quality of the	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	397.88087463378906	48
cognisant in its capability to discipline, to discern and to separate what the facts	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	387.9698028564453	48
are from the values, and the realm of the object from its subjective world. These	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	390.07081604003906	48
characterisations of the notion of objectivity are, in turn, to be linked to the third	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	385.68190002441406	48
tenet of positivism, the idea of the methodological unity of science which consider	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	397.13294982910156	48
that the approaches developed to make sense of the natural world are	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	342.77085876464844	48
appropriate to address the social world as its fundamental nature, a realm of	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	372.2947540283203	48
object, is not essentially different from the former. In sum, within a positivist	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	367.1686248779297	48
scenario, the two definitions of objectivity are encompassing the notions of	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	362.7939910888672	48
subjectivity and reflexivity. Subjectivity, for instance, is understood as defining the	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	397.0778350830078	48
natural relation the cognisant entertains with the cognised, the aim of the former	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	390.43397521972656	48
being to transcend his subjectivity to reach an objective mode of relation to the	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	383.3828887939453	48
latter. As the cognised is an object, the only subject of science, the cognisant,	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	379.42286682128906	48
has to be objective. In this sense, the cognisant has to be reflexive to the	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	355.8938446044922	48
cognised to the extent the cognisant has to discipline his relation to the latter in	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	385.19789123535156	48
order for it to reach an objective, value-free, status. Subjectivity and reflexivity are	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	397.96876525878906	48
thus subsumed into the two definitions of objectivity as mentioned before. [11]	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	379.54701232910156	48
This positivist understanding of the concepts of subjectivity and reflexivity is	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	368.2357940673828	49
highly embedded in the epistemological developments within natural sciences	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	378.5428009033203	49
and unfortunately is rather poor for the social sciences if bluntly translated. In	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	376.1778106689453	49
effect, social sciences, as part of the humanities, study human consciousness as	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0162353515625	394.5670928955078	49
a subject (whether individually or collectively) of a material world within which it	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	383.65760803222656	49
constructs a social, intersubjective world (GUZZINI 2000, p.164) by the	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	346.1257781982422	49
interweaving of what BAKHTIN (1986b) would call texts, that is all the activities by	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0162353515625	398.5479278564453	49
which human beings are "readable". A text, in the BAKHTINian sense,	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0162353515625	342.2989044189453	49
encompasses both narrative and behavioural "documents", which should not be	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	388.6959991455078	49
understood as an exclusive choice, in the humanities, to the sole discourse	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	365.47483825683594	49
analysis or hermeneutical perspectives. The aim of social sciences is to read the	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	392.84291076660156	49
different texts of human activities, that the cognised produces whether	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0162353515625	342.39292907714844	49
consciously or not, through different lenses (the diverse sub-fields of social	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	365.07884216308594	49
sciences) and a diversity of approaches (positivist, structuralist, systemist,	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	360.7447052001953	49
dialogical, etc.). To reframe this argument in BAKHTIN's words (1986c, p.161),	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	384.5109405517578	49
natural sciences are monological while social sciences are dialogical in regards to	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	398.63990783691406	49
their "object" of studies. Natural sciences necessarily and naturally possess what	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	394.1958770751953	49
BAKHTIN calls an "epistemological consciousness" which is "a unitary and	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	363.5388641357422	49
unique consciousness".	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	115.40092468261719	49
"Everything this consciousness deals with must be determined by itself alone: any	167.39999389648438	689.0361328125	10.0	359.1998596191406	50
determinateness must be derived from itself and any determination of an object must	167.39999389648438	703.236083984375	10.0	373.5699157714844	50
be performed by itself. In this sense, epistemological consciousness cannot have	167.39999389648438	717.3360595703125	10.0	356.5599670410156	50

sovereign unity that would stand over against it with its own fate, one not determined	167.39999389648438	108.93609619140625	10.01470947265625	370.8598937988281	53
by epistemological consciousness. This unitary consciousness creates and forms any	167.39999389648438	123.03607177734375	10.0	376.5999450683594	53
matter it deals with solely as an object and not as a subiectum, and even a subiectum	167.39999389648438	137.236083984375	10.01470947265625	375.6299743652344	53
is no more than an object for it. The subiectum is known and understood only as an	167.39999389648438	151.33612060546875	10.01470947265625	366.2599182128906	53
object, for only valuation could render him a subiectum—the bearer of his own	167.39999389648438	165.53607177734375	10.01470947265625	343.3600158691406	53
autonomous life, experiencing his own fate" (BAKHTIN 1990, pp.88-89). [12]	167.39999389648438	179.6361083984375	10.01470947265625	336.16998291015625	53
The humanities on the contrary have to take into account the subiectum because	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0162353515625	394.93812561035156	54
they possess the "specific task of establishing, transmitting and interpreting the	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	385.96778869628906	54
words of others" (BAKHTIN 1981, p.351). Natural sciences are the only subject,	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	388.99293518066406	54

necessarily voiceless. To give a voice to the cognised, it is then important in	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0162353515625	370.2259063720703	54
social sciences to consider the cognised as a subject and to try to adapt our	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	370.53492736816406	54
epistemology to this fundamental consideration. In review then, social sciences	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	385.1538848876953	54
are oriented towards the reflexive interconnection of at least two subjects, that of	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	393.2168731689453	54
the cognisant and that of the cognised. The fact that the cognised is regarded as	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	394.2069854736328	54
an "object" in the positivist sense is as much an epistemic choice as it is to regard	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	398.46388244628906	54
the cognised as a "subject" in the dialogical sense. However, the dialogical	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	364.30882263183594	54
perspective tries to problematise the inherent subjective quality of the cognised.	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	388.60792541503906	54

In order to address these different elements by focalising on the question of	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	369.21485900878906	56
identity and identity formation, I will hereby elaborate a dialogical perspective,	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	377.45179748535156	56
grounded on Mikhail Mikhailovitch BAKHTIN's works. The widespread interest in	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	391.1768341064453	56
BAKHTIN thinking has been a major source of renewal in several disciplines such	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	398.24391174316406	56
as in literary studies, linguistics or the humanities in general3. It has, however,	144.6999969482422	517.859130859375	11.62054443359375	378.38502502441406	56

some authors which used him in a very impressionistic way (see ASHLEY 1989,	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	390.07081604003906	56
pp.263 and 281; SHAPIRO 1989, p.81). One has to refer to an article by Iver B.	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	387.9478302001953	56

alterity nexus. By focalising on identity and identity formation in international	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	369.6988067626953	56

operation), underpinning most IR works so far, would not be alone anymore to	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	380.8638458251953	56
serve as an underlying characterisation of the interplay between states or other	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	386.03395080566406	56
agents in the international system. The identity-alterity nexus is in effect a	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	358.7647247314453	56
contending, yet not necessarily competing, characterisation at the heart of the	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	379.88490295410156	56
epistemological and methodological renewal witnessed during the past decade.	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	386.8150177001953	56
This renewal fundamentally concentrated on the questioning of the definition and	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	394.2770538330078	56

understanding and explanation of international relations. As WENDT (1992)	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	369.2257843017578	60
showed, anarchy had been reified by traditional approaches and thus became a	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	389.00404357910156	60
substantive concept which was used to deterministically construct its objects of	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	384.4827423095703	60
study. Anarchy became the structural lenses through which the object of study—	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	392.9639434814453	60
most generally the state—was constructed. The problem with "positivist"	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	352.0107879638672	60
perspectives in IR was then not so much about the idea that social facts, the	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	372.3828887939453	60
object of study and, for some, reality as such were constructed but rather the	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	375.1768341064453	60
question of "how" it was done and which consequences it has reflectively on IR	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	385.2199249267578	60
theory. This is precisely the kind of questions a dialogical understanding of	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	363.5939178466797	60
international relations tries to answer to. However, by using "identity" as a	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	358.65476989746094	60
different pattern of understanding we should not fall into the same conceptual	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	377.5309600830078	60
trap. Constructivism, as a research programme, has to avoid following the new	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	383.9549102783203	60
"logic of identity", as traditional approaches followed the "logic of anarchy", in	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	375.78187561035156	60
order to construct a valid and coherent epistemic body (WEBER 2001, p.78). [14]	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	396.3470001220703	60
In using the category "identity" we should therefore be aware of and emphasise	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	387.39796447753906	61
the inherent difficulties and ambiguities related to it, as "identity" is both a	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	356.93382263183594	61
category of political and social practices and a category of political and social	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	375.69386291503906	61
analysis (see BRUBAKER & COOPER 2000). An "identity" might then be a	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	365.3537139892578	61
category of practice of a cognised subject who might be taken as an "object"	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	373.4608917236328	61
through the lenses of "identity" as a category of analysis. We are thus precisely in	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	398.5849151611328	61
the moment where the traditionally defined subjectivity and objectivity are	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	356.8507537841797	61
collapsing together, since what is felt as an "identity" by a subject can be	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	354.37583923339844	61
interpreted only through its objectivation—its constitution as a category of	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	357.9947967529297	61
analysis. As mentioned, the danger of such a necessary objectivational	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	346.66197204589844	61
movement lies in its reification, which according to our dialogical framework can	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	388.60780334472656	61
be understood in two complementary ways. First, and in a more classical	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	354.95875549316406	61
understanding, if "identity" is not a necessary category of analysis to make sense	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	395.58192443847656	61
of phenomenon related to "identity" as a category of practice, it should not be	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	376.8048858642578	61
used "...in an implicitly or explicitly reifying manner, in a manner that implies or	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	381.8756866455078	61
asserts that ... 'identities' exists and that people 'have' ... an 'identity'". This type	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	387.29884338378906	61
of reification is however common, as exemplified by the neorealist use of	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	354.77183532714844	61
"anarchy", and therefore scholars,	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	166.3199005126953	61
"[...] should seek to account for this process of reification. We should seek to explain	167.39999389648438	590.0361328125	10.0	371.3597106933594	62
the processes and mechanisms through which what has been called the 'political	167.39999389648438	604.1361083984375	10.0	355.4198913574219	62

compelling reality. But we should avoid unintentionally reproducing or reinforcing such	167.39999389648438	632.4360961914062	10.01470947265625	376.5599670410156	62

(BRUBAKER & COOPER 2000, pp.5-6; see also MELUCCI 1995, pp.42, 50-51). [15]	167.39999389648438	660.736083984375	10.0	373.5700378417969	62
Second, following a dialogical understanding and in an attempt to address	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	360.9759063720703	63
BRUBAKER and COOPER's stance, reification also means to treat the cognised	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	392.45790100097656	63
as a voiceless "object". It is to say, as we will see, that "identity", as a category of	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	395.2188262939453	63
analysis, should not become a monological construction of categories of	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	351.88987731933594	63
practices. The cognised is or has been a subject and "identity" as a fictional	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	368.51087951660156	63

cannot therefore be studied as a voiceless "object" since it will characterise it as a	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	398.9488067626953	63

thing and not as a reflexive self-representation. A dialogical understanding of	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	374.72584533691406	66
"identity", and therefore any objectivational movement adopting such a	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	344.1909637451172	66
perspective, partially lift up this problem by approaching an "identity" through the	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	392.10511779785156	66
conscious mediation of a hermeneutical locus from which an "identity" is set in a	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	390.35682678222656	66
dialogical network relative to other "identities" (alterity) defined as relevant by	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	375.3190460205078	66
their place in this network (determined by their expression, contextuality and rela-	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	396.06300354003906	66
tionality in/to this "identity"). Dialogism then is a sound way to propose an	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	356.86170959472656	66
analysis of "identity" without falling into the reification of the concept, as it was the	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	397.9907989501953	66
case with "anarchy". It is furthermore a sound assessment of the epistemic	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	364.9769744873047	66
relation the cognisant has with the cognised. In effect, the process of	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	335.90684509277344	66
objectivation should not become the effacing of the subjective quality of this	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	368.97279357910156	66
"object". The cognisant should enter in a dialogue with the cognised. This	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	358.17091369628906	66
dialogue, however, shall never be "full" as there will always be a discrepancy in	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	385.05482482910156	66
the communication between the two elements. It precisely is in this dissymmetric,	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	396.16481018066406	66
but not necessarily unequal, relation that lies the possibility of knowledge as the	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	388.58583068847656	66
cognisant situates him/herself outside the cognised, establishing a dissymmetric	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	391.13795471191406	66
dialogue by framing this interrelation through a problématique (in the French	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0162353515625	371.5359649658203	66
acception) (AMORIM 1996, pp.22-23, 31, 59). [16]	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	245.44700622558594	66
So let's turn now to the key notion of dialogism to see how it can allow us to	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	368.7747344970703	67
tackle in a positive and heuristic perspective the problematic relations the notion	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	390.1698760986328	67
of "identity" raises in IR theory. In effect, dialogism can constitute a model which	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	390.6758575439453	67
can epistemologically address the need of an adequate framework in relation to	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	388.27796936035156	67
the nexus between "identity" and "alterity" while integrating in this framework the	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	391.28077697753906	67
notions of subjectivity and reflexivity.4 Dialogism is a concept which mainly has to	144.6999969482422	447.1590881347656	11.62060546875	394.4849395751953	67
do with discursive elements and relates more specifically to utterances. BAKHTIN	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	398.1668243408203	67
(1986a, p.92, my emphasis) states that:	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	194.23793029785156	67
"The expression of an utterance can never be fully understood or explained if its	167.39999389648438	505.1361083984375	10.0	351.2998962402344	68
thematic content is all that is taken into account. The expression of an utterance	167.39999389648438	519.236083984375	10.0	351.6598205566406	68

responsiveness may not have assumed a clear-cut external expression. [...] The	167.39999389648438	604.1361083984375	10.01470947265625	352.6600036621094	68
utterance is filled with dialogic overtones, and they must be taken into account in	167.39999389648438	618.350830078125	10.0	353.6596984863281	68
order to understand fully the style of the utterance. After all, our thought itself [...] is	167.39999389648438	632.4360961914062	10.01470947265625	363.7999572753906	68

An utterance is thus a moment within a semantic network which is composed by	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	390.3347930908203	69

somehow "responding to". This interweaving of utterances is not necessarily an	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	387.0970001220703	73
interrelation between actual and active utterances, as it can in fact exist between	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	393.2938995361328	73
actual and active utterances and absent and passive ones (TODOROV 1981,	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	377.4209747314453	73
p.97). All in all, an utterance is functionally defined by at least one or many	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	363.56080627441406	73
utterances which belong to a set of utterances either contemporary and/or pre-	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	384.13099670410156	73
existing, active and/or passive. There is another essential quality of the utterance:	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	398.4309844970703	73
"[I]ts quality of being directed to someone, its addressivity. [...] This addressee can be	167.39999389648438	207.93609619140625	10.01470947265625	375.8599548339844	74
an immediate participant-interlocutor in an everyday dialogue, [...] a more or less	167.39999389648438	222.1361083984375	10.0	353.4997863769531	74

composition and, particularly, the style of the utterance depend on those to whom the	167.39999389648438	264.55078125	10.0	374.1598205566406	74
utterance is addressed, how the speaker (or writer) senses and imagines his	167.39999389648438	278.75079345703125	10.0	336.5997619628906	74
addressees, and the force of their effect on the utterance" (BAKHTIN 1986a, p.95,	167.39999389648438	292.83612060546875	10.01470947265625	360.9700012207031	74

Addressivity is therefore another central characteristic of any utterance since it	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	382.5908966064453	75
provides an anchorage between dialogism and a theory of "identity". There are	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	383.5919952392578	75
two mains reasons for such an affirmation. On the one hand, it is necessary to	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	381.97486877441406	75
understand an utterance as an all-embracing category which is not limited only to	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	395.86781311035156	75
purely discursive practices. Any utterance is indeed a conception of the world, a	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	388.97096252441406	75
Weltanschauung (TODOROV 1981, p.97). As noted by BAKHTIN in his 1926	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0162353515625	375.7218780517578	75
"Discourse in Life and Discourse in Art" (BAKHTIN 1994, pp.163-164),	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	343.0787811279297	75
"the extraverbal situation is far from being merely the external cause of an utterance	167.39999389648438	448.5361022949219	10.0	369.3596496582031	76
—it does not operate on the utterance from outside, as if it were a mechanical force.	167.39999389648438	462.6361083984375	10.0	369.8697814941406	76
Rather, the situation enters into the utterance as an essential constitutive part of [its	167.39999389648438	476.8360900878906	10.0	366.9998474121094	76
semantic structure]". [19]	167.39999389648438	490.93609619140625	10.0	110.07000732421875	76
On the other hand, in an intertextual relation5, the utterance witnesses a subject.	144.6999969482422	517.859130859375	11.62054443359375	391.52406311035156	77
In other words, an utterance in order to be part of a dialogical network has not	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	379.91786193847656	77
only to embody a semantic or logical relation to an object but also receive an	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	373.76881408691406	77
author, its originator by which he/she expresses his/her position. From language	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	390.8849639892578	77
we thus enter another realm of existence, that of subjectivity, as an utterance can	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	397.0998077392578	77
be the actual expression of the cognised self-understanding/representation. [20]	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	390.14698791503906	77
In order to understand international relations in a dialogical manner by focalising	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	390.8738555908203	78
on identity as a factor, it is then necessary to provide an analytical tool enabling	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	387.0789337158203	78
the cognisant to make sense of the cognised without reifying the latter according	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	392.8870391845703	78
to the problématique of the former. The hermeneutical locus provides such a tool	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.01617431640625	394.6530303955078	78
as it is characterised as the interweaving in a specific place (the utterance) of an	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	392.07289123535156	78
identity's expression, its contextuality and its relations to other identities (other	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	379.9178009033203	78
utterances). In review then, dialogism is defined as the interweaving of	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.01617431640625	343.6540069580078	78
utterances that respond to each other. An utterance is characterised as a	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.0162353515625	357.2569122314453	78

Furthermore, an utterance's addressivity links its discursive dimension to its	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	368.4007110595703	82
subjective one by enabling the discerning of its figuration of alterity, hence	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	361.3717498779297	82
dialogically of its own self. What is then missing is an understanding of the	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	363.0547637939453	82
significance of alterity to identity (and vice versa) within a dialogical framework.	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	384.55970764160156	82
BAKHTIN (1990, pp.15-16) characterises this relation between a self and an	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	372.06385803222656	82
other as transgredient. This notion, borrowed from nineteenth century German	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	382.2719268798828	82
school of aestheticism, states that an element is named transgredient when it	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	377.2998809814453	82
designates "elements of our conscience which are exteriors to it but nonetheless	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	392.4689483642578	82
essential to the process of its perfection, to its constitution as a totality"	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	345.8396759033203	82
(TODOROV 1981, p.146). Transgredience means that a self establishes a	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	362.8459014892578	82
necessary relation with a multitude of other selves (alterity); a self alone cannot	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	385.9898223876953	82
therefore constitute and be itself within its own realm of existence without the	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	375.16566467285156	82
other. According to BAKHTIN's anthropological philosophy, it is therefore	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	355.14573669433594	82
impossible to become truly self-conscious, to be one self, if one does not reveals	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	393.7559356689453	82
one's self to the other, through the other and with the help of the other (BAKHTIN	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	396.6378936767578	82
1984, p.287). [21]	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	86.64700317382812	82
For BAKHTIN, in order to reach an encompassing view of a self, one has to	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	368.75294494628906	83
integrate through dialogue the vision of a multitude of interactions between the	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	382.8988800048828	83
self and selves (alterity) and their position in the world. Dialogism is therefore an	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	391.04981994628906	83
epistemologically sound way to establish such semantic network (BAKHTIN 1990,	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	398.9809112548828	83
p.36). Even monological utterances enter a dialogical network even if they	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	361.05284118652344	83
participate in an unsound ethical and epistemological position since they deny	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	379.47792053222656	83
"the existence outside itself of another consciousness with equal rights and equal	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	396.4400177001953	83
responsibilities, another I with equal rights [...]". Furthermore, in a monological	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	380.68775939941406	83
approach, taken at its extreme,	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	151.71189880371094	83
"[a]nother person remains wholly and merely an object of consciousness, and not	167.39999389648438	505.1361083984375	10.0147705078125	357.1699523925781	84
another consciousness. No response is expected from it that could change	167.39999389648438	519.236083984375	10.0	329.1598205566406	84
everything in the world of my consciousness. Monologue is finalized and deaf to the	167.39999389648438	533.4360961914062	10.0	366.9598693847656	84
other's response, does not expect it and does not acknowledge in it any decisive	167.39999389648438	547.5361328125	10.0	353.2598571777344	84
force. Monologue manages without the other, and therefore to some degree	167.39999389648438	561.736083984375	10.0147705078125	333.259765625	84
materializes all reality. Monologue pretends to be the ultimate world. It closes down	167.39999389648438	575.850830078125	10.0	364.7596740722656	84
the represented world and represented persons" (BAKHTIN 1984, pp.292-293). [22]	167.39999389648438	590.0361328125	10.01470947265625	368.6700134277344	84
Within a monological figuration then, the other becomes an object of the self's	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	380.36891174316406	85
own conscience which can be interpreted and modified at will in function of the	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	382.87684631347656	85
self's own needs as a self-representation. BAKHTIN's dialogism is thus	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	346.32371520996094	85
concerned with both ethics and epistemology. Ethically, the completion and	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	366.6737823486328	85
perfection of one's self is determined by the reflexive and dialogical integration of	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	394.58607482910156	85
other selves (contrary to a monological perspective). Epistemologically, dialogism	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	396.4690704345703	85
enables us to access soundly the identity-alterity nexus by stressing their inter-	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	383.7630157470703	85
relations in an interweaving of mutually-responsive utterances which can be	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	368.9618682861328	85
understood by the delimitation of a hermeneutical locus. This interweaving	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	361.85572814941406	85
relation constitutes in turn the transgredient relation between a self and other	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	375.36903381347656	85
selves: one cannot be defined without an other. We will see in the next section	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	382.6018829345703	85

Some IR scholars have already underlined the necessity to address the identity-	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	389.82899475097656	89

(WENDT 1999, pp.21-22, original emphasis) when we have to make sense of	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	378.4989776611328	89
international politics, which fundamentally is a politics of the other, a politics of	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	380.3907012939453	89
alterity (GUILLAUME 2002). Otherness should be taken into account in IR theory	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0162353515625	394.6820831298828	89
to react to the positivistic orientation which dismissed the subjective quality of the	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	395.26283264160156	89
other by assuming that it is a functional equivalent to an identity (see WALTZ	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	375.67176818847656	89
1979, pp.95-97). Furthermore, traditional approaches assumed the rationality,	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	379.4008331298828	89
and thus uniformity, of the multiple identities interacting in the international	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	362.35780334472656	89

refusing to acknowledge this "field of possibilities" (DOTY 1996, pp.340-341) that	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	395.1320343017578	89
the notions identity and alterity possess in their political, cultural and sometimes	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	388.14576721191406	89
vital implications. This specific "field of possibilities" is beginning to be explored	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	385.0641632080078	89
by IR scholars such as R.B.J. WALKER (1993) or David L. BLANEY and Naeem	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	392.19374084472656	89

critical approaches essentially focalised on normative and ethical dimensions.	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	377.98182678222656	89

without trying on the first hand to epistemologically integrate the identity-alterity	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	385.64881896972656	89
nexus to IR, and by extension the notions of subjectivity and reflexivity. [24]	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	366.64698791503906	89
This section tried to underline dialogism as an epistemological alternative to the	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	387.9698028564453	90
traditional positivist perspective underpinning most IR scholarship since the	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	366.6408233642578	90
1950s. While positivism might have a certain relevance for number of topics	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	370.12782287597656	90
related to international relations, it remains that positivism is only but one	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	355.24464416503906	90
epistemic stance among others. Dialogism represents one of these possible	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	370.45790100097656	90
stances, in particular in relation to the identity-alterity nexus problématique which	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0162353515625	393.32106018066406	90
positivism tends to avoid as the idea of the subjectivity of the cognised is	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	354.3538360595703	90
dismissed through the veil of objectivity. In effect, we have seen that a way to	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	377.16773986816406	90
tackle the identity-alterity nexus according to dialogism is to define identity as an	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	391.6768341064453	90
utterance in the sense and with the consequences I have underlined according to	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	396.6050567626953	90
a dialogical perspective. This perspective furthermore defines identity, a	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	350.6357879638672	90
subjectivity, in its transgredient relation to otherness, that is alternative subjective	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	395.36183166503906	90
self-understandings/representations. Dialogism is thus a way to address the first	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	391.20387268066406	90
level of the scientific inquiry, the level of the cognised's subjective relations, prob-	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	396.2630157470703	90
lematised in this framework as identities, by recognising the "object of study" as a	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	397.6618194580078	90
subiectum and not as a voiceless thing. The hermeneutical locus, understood	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.01617431640625	377.5609893798828	90
dialogically as the interwoven relations in an utterance of the identity-alterity	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	369.1597442626953	90
nexus, thus becomes the actual "dynamic epistemic structure according to which	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	393.55787658691406	90
the 'act' or 'phenomenal' event means and functions" (DOP 2000, p.18). The	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	372.8778839111328	90
cognised subjectivity is then accessible to the cognisant through an assessment	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	390.3531036376953	90
of its expressivity, its contextuality and its relationality vis-à-vis other subjective	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.0162353515625	383.6430206298828	90
self-understandings/ representations. This structure is constructed through the	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	382.6679229736328	90

To consider the cognised as a subject is, of course, an ontological position in the	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	394.08595275878906	94
same sense that those who consider the cognised as an object participate to	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	374.18690490722656	94
another ontological position. To recognise this most forgotten evidence does not	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	391.5229034423828	94
only participate to a reflexive consideration about any form of approaches, such	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	388.0799102783203	94
as dialogism, but also requires us to undertake an epistemological discussion of	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	389.9939727783203	94
this approach according to this stance. In effect, any approach should to a	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	361.69090270996094	94
minimum extent integrate a reflection on the epistemic consequences one's own	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	391.4679718017578	94
ontological choices bear. Such assessments should, in turn, take into	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	337.8538360595703	94
consideration the two levels of scientific inquiry remaining to further discuss: i) the	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	398.72779846191406	94
relation between the cognisant and the cognised and, ii) the relations between	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	381.00697326660156	94
the cognisants. The hermeneutical locus, a dialogical mechanism I introduced in	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	391.17091369628906	94
the previous section, provides us with a tool by which both levels can be	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0162353515625	350.82997131347656	94
considered in examining and taking into account the expressivity, the	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	336.15989685058594	94
contextuality and the relationality of each levels. Moreover, each level is more	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	377.9378204345703	94
particularly concerned with a specific problem or concern, whether that of	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	357.1808319091797	94
reification the cognisant might impose on the cognised or of the meaning of the	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	386.5839385986328	94
intersubjective quality of the relations existing between the cognisants. In other	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	384.33998107910156	94
words, the hermeneutical locus should represent a reflexive tool for and on IR	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	378.90589904785156	94
theory. [26]	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	55.24699401855469	94
As mentioned, one of the main problems which faces any approach wishing to	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	381.27088928222656	95
recognise the subjective quality of the cognised is that of reification. Dialogism,	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	384.7907257080078	95
via the hermeneutical locus, tries to bypass this problem by focusing on a	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	357.9618377685547	95
dialogical account of the cognised. In effect, according to this perspective, the	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	379.68690490722656	95
object of study is not the cognised itself but the process of their interrelations and	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0162353515625	395.9619903564453	95
interactions. As Pierre BOURDIEU noted once, "il faut penser relationnellement"	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0162353515625	391.29396057128906	95
[one has to think relationally] (1992a, p.200). The cognisant is actually fostering a	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	397.08900451660156	95
subjective and reflexive relation to the cognised according to a problématique	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0162353515625	377.2400665283203	95
delineating the cognised's "objectivation" in its interrelations with other subjects.	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	388.60768127441406	95
BAKHTIN (1986c, p.161) sustains that a subject cannot, epistemologically, be	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	379.56593322753906	95
studied as thing for to do so would make it voiceless while being subiectum.	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.0162353515625	369.44703674316406	95
"Cognition of it [therefore] can only be dialogic". This signifies that the process of	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.01617431640625	393.4109649658203	95
objectivation, the structuring of a subject into a problématique, is possible as long	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.01617431640625	396.8500518798828	95
as this objectivation does not transform a subiectum into a voiceless object. The	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0162353515625	390.7560577392578	95
objectivation should not become an instrumentalisation of the subject to the pro-	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0162353515625	390.6630401611328	95
blématique and the subsequent theoretical framework as was the case with most	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.01617431640625	394.6789093017578	95
positivist scholarship. An interesting and simple example, illustrated by a recent	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	386.7638702392578	95
article from Richard LEBOW (2001), is the classical interpretation and use of	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	373.9667510986328	95
THUCYDIDES' History of the Peloponnesian War as a one of the main realist	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.01617431640625	377.10597229003906	95
forebear in their different claims about the structure of the war-peace nexus	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	368.4668731689453	95
(WALTZ 1979, p.127). THUCYDIDES has always been seen as one of the first	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	384.79090881347656	95
setting the underpinning elements of IR realism such as: (a) the centrality of the	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	388.76173400878906	95
states (city-states) as the dominant and functionally equivalent units of action; (b)	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	395.73597717285156	95
the depiction of the states as power-seeking entities whether as a means or as an	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	399.4980010986328	95
end and (c) the ascription to the states of a rational behaviour assessable in	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	370.47987365722656	95

rational terms (KEOHANE 1986, p.7). Furthermore, THUCYDIDES' account of	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	381.48085021972656	98
war and his "causal" approach to facts made him an enlightened observer on the	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	394.0691680908203	98
mechanisms at work in an anarchic system—a system in which nothing higher	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	381.49098205566406	98
than the units can either delimit or reduce the units in their power-seeking drive	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	385.6708526611328	98
—, thus reflecting the "state of nature", a zero-sum game like environment, in	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	377.2448272705078	98
which these units act. THUCYDIDES is thus deemed to have set up and to reflect	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	397.69386291503906	98
the natural and unchanging rules that drove, drive and will drive the states in their	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	397.0448760986328	98
relations and then is basically reflecting the fundamental hard core of the realist	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	387.7058868408203	98
research programme (see LAKATOS 1970, p.48). [27]	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	264.94700622558594	98
These use and appropriation are, however, and to follow LEBOW (2001, p.559),	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	390.8299102783203	99
a "superficial and one-sided portrayal" of THUCYDIDES' book which is typical of	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	390.8737335205078	99
a certain perspective of IR theory as a nomothetic approach to the social world	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	383.66896057128906	99
(see LEVY 2001, p.41). In effect, realists tend to superimpose their programme's	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	394.05287170410156	99
hard core to the articulation of, in this case, THUCYDIDES' Peloponnesian War	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0162353515625	387.0181427001953	99
while ignoring the incompleteness and errors such a superimposition bears	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	365.6288604736328	99
(BAGBY 1994, LEBOW 2001). These critics follows the line of the traditional	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	372.59181213378906	99
distinction between nomothetic (e.g. IR theory) and idiographic (e.g. history)	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	370.20472717285156	99
disciplines and the need for the former to adopt some of the latter's natural	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	364.6167755126953	99
impetus to regard evidences, whether pro or contra one's theory, and context as	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0162353515625	390.8760528564453	99
compelling elements since the former tend to "allow their theories to take priority	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	391.74293518066406	99
over the evidence, focus on those historical events that confirm their theories,	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	378.28981018066406	99
and ignore the larger context in which events occur and in the absence of which	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	389.09193420410156	99
those events cannot be fully understood" (LEVY 2001, pp.49-50). The nomothetic	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	397.5950469970703	99
drive to construct and test theories is the underlying reason why THUCYDIDES	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	386.2537384033203	99
was perceived by the realists as a forebear since they picked in his work what	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	378.88380432128906	99
seemed to fulfil their expectations, as in the Melian Dialogue, and to provide a	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	379.3788604736328	99
test for their ahistorical theory on how international relations were framed and	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	377.5637969970703	99
worked. LEBOW strikingly demonstrates a contrario that if a "realist"	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0162353515625	333.42591857910156	99
THUCYDIDES is indeed present, he is far from being the only, or even the most	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	390.0929718017578	99
important, THUCYDIDES speaking in the Peloponnesian War: There is also a	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0162353515625	379.43800354003906	99
constructivist THUCYDIDES voicing in the text. In effect, a close reading of	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	366.16773986816406	99
THUCYDIDES' History shows that his underlying inquiry is that of the relationship	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0162353515625	396.42897033691406	99
between nomos (convention) and phusis (nature), and its implications for the	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.0162353515625	373.7779083251953	99
constitution of the Greek culture and civilisation, and that his conclusion	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	349.2607879638672	99
emphasises the role of nomos in the construction of identities and in the	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.01617431640625	350.91090393066406	99
delineation and limitation of the behaviour of both individuals and societies	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	362.2628631591797	99
(LEBOW 2001). As this example illustrated, the main problem with non-reflexive	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	389.9497833251953	99
nomothetic perspectives is that they consider the way of doing science in what	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	382.0188751220703	99
Michel MEYER (1986, p.20) coins an apocritical direction, that is a direction which	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	398.74989318847656	99
isolate a certain number of problems (e.g. why states go to war?) and by	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	354.03477478027344	99
answering these problems seeks to solve and suppress them as such. In a	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	364.95790100097656	99
fashion that is parallel to natural sciences, the aim of "positivist" social sciences is	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	398.34278869628906	99
to offer, as Meyer underlined, "an apocritical answer [which] closes the inquiry,	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	382.8988800048828	99
stems back and breaks away from the problems at stake" as it provides an	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	364.2538299560547	99
answer which is supposed to solve and suppress the question altogether. [28]	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	379.14698791503906	99

Social sciences, however, by answering to a problématique do not actually solve,	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0162353515625	394.9970245361328	102
and thus suppress, the "problem" at the origin the latter. Natural sciences deal	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	381.6118927001953	102
with objective questionings that require definite answers in order to suppress	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	373.7989044189453	102
them. Of course, once solved these questionings create new ones but they are	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	384.6920928955078	102
definitively "behind" in the realm of science. In other words, we do not ask	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	359.65577697753906	102
ourselves the question to know why an apple falls from a tree anymore yet we still	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	398.90382385253906	102
wonder why states go to war. This recurrent questioning still manage to create	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	382.0628204345703	102
wide debates in IR, as in the Democratic Peace debate, despite nearly three	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	371.77784729003906	102
thousands years of more or less cunning tries from THUCYDIDES' hubris to	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0162353515625	370.71998596191406	102
HUNTINGTON's civilisational explanation. Maybe the right answer has yet to be	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	389.34107971191406	102
found, and many liberals see in the Democratic Peace argument such a definite	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	388.77296447753906	102
answer (see RUSSETT 1993), yet none of the answers so far given brought	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	370.40296936035156	102
about the suppression of the question "why states go to war?" or the peace-war	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	388.05799865722656	102
nexus problématique as such. Anyhow, if Democratic Peace proponents would	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0162353515625	383.6239776611328	102
prove that in order to solve and suppress this question altogether it was	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	348.75486755371094	102
necessary to establish global democracy in the world, it remains nonetheless that	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	396.1978302001953	102
the peace-war nexus would still remain as a problématique, whether or not it is	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0162353515625	383.1369171142578	102
transformed in a softer or more focused articulation between co-operation and	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	381.1719512939453	102
conflict. States, or other agents of international relations, will always interact,	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	373.1758575439453	102
perform or behave in a way that will require IR scholars to consider which nexus	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	389.8290557861328	102
might be the most relevant to explain or understand some phenomena. [29]	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	367.8470001220703	102
The focus of IR theory should then shift from this traditional apocritical direction,	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	389.78480529785156	103
which blindfolds many IR scholars from epistemic and, often, methodological	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	373.95887756347656	103
problems, to a more reflexive direction as underlined by ALVESSON and	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	355.04676818847656	103
SKÖLDBERG's definition (2000, p.5). As their definition suggests, there are two	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	389.26783752441406	103
moments in which reflexivity can take part in IR theory. The first movement is	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	371.7938995361328	103
related to the second level of the scientific inquiry while the second movement is	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	376.00001525878906	103
related to the third level. On the one hand, reflexivity is thus present in the	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	360.4697723388672	103
relations the cognisant has with the cognised, that is how the former reflexively	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	384.4607696533203	103
constructs the latter and the process of its interactions and interrelations with	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	374.7587432861328	103
other subjects. Dialogism offers such a frame, as presented in the previous	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	366.6298370361328	103
section, by delineating the cognisant scope of inquiry according to a reflexive tool,	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	399.12391662597656	103
the hermeneutical locus, which specifically deals with processuality, through its	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	384.2339630126953	103
focus on relationality, and aims at bridging IR theory nomothetic tradition to a	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	375.46278381347656	103
more idiographic conception for dialogism possesses a particular interest in	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	367.96083068847656	103
contextuality and expressivity. The three elements of the hermeneutical locus	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	376.6508331298828	103
entail that a special attention should be paid to the actual reflexive way by which	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	390.30189514160156	103
the cognisant chooses the "identities" at stake in its construction of a	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	335.16981506347656	103
problématique. An elegant way to further avoid reification and instrumentalization	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.01617431640625	395.03688049316406	103
is thus to employ conscious counterfactual thought experiments which, in the	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	375.0668487548828	103
words of Philip TETLOCK and Aaron BELKIN (1996, p.15), provides, by	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	350.4268035888672	103

eyes, that counterfactuals could take according to TETLOCK and BELKIN. Both	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	389.6858673095703	107
authors actually favour counterfactuals within a highly positivist perspective on	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	381.3588409423828	107
how to deal with social sciences, rejecting altogether the implications of	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	347.87474060058594	107
counterfactuals within more interpretative perspectives (whether constructivist or	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	391.9958038330078	107
postmodern for instance) in world politics. Hence, TETLOCK and BELKIN	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	359.0836639404297	107
implicitly put aside those latter perspectives as unscientific as they are and not	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	382.1949005126953	107

nonfalsifiable standpoints (TETLOCK & BELKIN 1996, pp.27, 30-31, 37-38). This	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	395.7688751220703	107
view, as stressed by Steven WEBER (1996) and Richard LEBOW (2000, p.578),	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	393.30494689941406	107
is extremely reductive on the possible use of such an interesting tool and one	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	376.88197326660156	107
should, on the contrary, expand its scope by focusing more on its use as a way	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	385.57191467285156	107

contextuality and expressivity in order to determine which utterances, which	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	368.0487823486328	107
competing or alternative self-understanding/ representation(s) are to be	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	348.55686950683594	107
considered as dominant in the dialogical constitution and performance of an	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	369.8748321533203	107
intersubjective representation defined as national. There are naturally many	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	368.9508819580078	107
dialogical interactions constituting a self-understanding/representation, the point	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	389.93214416503906	107

logue should henceforth arise as a heuristic momentum only if it is put in	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0162353515625	353.34083557128906	107
perspective with counterfactual dominant and non-dominant dialogues, that is	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	367.72962951660156	107
alternative dialogues which allow the cognisant to a situated and processual	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	355.2238311767578	107
reference outside the self-understanding/representation constructed as a subject of	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	393.9810333251953	107
study. This necessity to evaluate alternative, counterfactual elements arise from	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	389.0790557861328	107

understand events ex post facto, that is it has been chosen in order to explain or	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0162353515625	391.7960968017578	107
understand a certain outcome, or even to fulfil the expectancies of the	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	341.2598114013672	107
problématique or the theoretical model chosen by the cognisant (this point always	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.0162353515625	398.0399932861328	107

Such a construction would not be epistemologically sound since it would then	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	376.17994689941406	107

Counterfactuals constitute therefore a way to reflexively and soundly construct a	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	390.9728546142578	108
problématique and its related theoretical developments. Furthermore,	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.01617431640625	338.04588317871094	108
counterfactual thought experiments are vital ingredients in the evaluation and	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	376.2169952392578	108
testing of the heuristic of the dominant dialogue proposed by the cognisant (see	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	389.10621643066406	108
LEBOW 2000, pp.558-564). This counterfactual logic globally follows a double	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	381.6889190673828	108
rationale which firstly establishes a dominant dialogue as a "logical imperative",	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	386.0888214111328	108

a specified situated intersubjectivity and relationality. This logical exercise is	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	369.7206573486328	108

Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory	144.6999969482422	61.24884033203125	8.0	334.1439971923828	110
by the problématique. Consequently, however, this dominant dialogue also has to	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0162353515625	397.3480987548828	111
be a "historical imperative", the second component of the counterfactual rationale	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	396.71119689941406	111
and which would result in a more idiographic dimension in IR theory, if one wants	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	394.7458038330078	111
to reach a sound understanding. This historical imperative seeks to consider the	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0162353515625	390.47999572753906	111
alternatives which were actually offered by the cognised according to contempo-	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	391.36305236816406	111
rary evidence (see FERGUSON 1997, p.79-90).6 The dominant dialogue chosen	144.6999969482422	178.25909423828125	11.62060546875	391.7881622314453	111
should therefore be the result of a double rationale—logical and historical—which	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	396.3429718017578	111
through an evaluation of the possible alternatives and of the robustness of	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	361.83387756347656	111
historical evidences should both alleviate the reification of the "identities"	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	353.74879455566406	111
contemplated, rule out a deterministic study of their dialogue and evaluate the	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	379.58790588378906	111
historical pertinence of the dialogue chosen by situating them simultaneously	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	375.0558624267578	111
within a probabilistic frame and a historical relevance. [32]	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	282.64698791503906	111
Reflexivity, on the other hand, is also present in the relations the cognisant	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	363.91282653808594	112
entertains with other cognisant. Reflexivity, following BOURDIEU's "epistemic	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	377.4096221923828	112
reflexivity" (BOURDIEU & WACQUANT 1992), means that the cognisant has to	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	387.43080139160156	112
consider that him/herself as a "cultural producer" and thus to reflect on the "socio-	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	399.2339630126953	112
historical conditions of possibility" of this specific discourse that is science. The	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	384.7357940673828	112
point is to subject the cognisant to the same critical inquiry he/she was compelled	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	397.1659698486328	112
to apply to the cognised. In BOURDIEU's terminology, any discipline of social	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	376.9806671142578	112
sciences has to undertake a work of "objectivation of the subject who objectivize"	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	395.4608917236328	112
in which open debates and mutual criticism, dialogical debates BAKHTIN would	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	387.2547149658203	112
say, are undertaken in order to institutionalise reflexivity. IR, however, possessed	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	395.4607696533203	112
and still possess to a large extent, according to LAPID (1989, pp.249-250), "the	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	387.3979034423828	112
dubious honor of being among the least self-reflexive of the Western social	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	366.31077575683594	112
sciences". Some IR scholars have nonetheless tried to tackle the notion of	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	362.59291076660156	112
reflexivity and to provide an account of it within the discipline. So far, the most	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	379.2907257080078	112
thorough treatment of the notion of reflexivity in IR, to my knowledge, is to be	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	375.8697052001953	112
found in Mark NEUFELD's The Restructuring of International Relations Theory	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0162353515625	382.3939971923828	112
(1995). NEUFELD (pp.13-21), drawing from KANT, HEGEL and MARX, situates	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	390.32374572753906	112
"theoretical reflexivity", in the overall category of critical thinking, as one of the	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	380.2477569580078	112
main characteristics of emancipatory theory. This specific positioning stands in	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	383.22889709472656	112
sharp opposition to positivist IR theory, and provides a special "attention to the	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	382.5797882080078	112
creative role of human consciousness, and an engagement in social criticism in	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	386.84791564941406	112

theoretical reflexivity therefore being the "theoretical reflection on the process of	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	389.8068389892578	112
theorizing itself". This general definition embeds three core elements which are	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	385.3520050048828	112
"(i) self-consciousness about underlying premises; (ii) the recognition of the	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	367.7407989501953	112
inherently politico-normative dimension of paradigms and the normal science	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	374.74781799316406	112
tradition they sustain; and (iii) the affirmation that reasoned judgements about the	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	397.28688049316406	112

observation of language". NEUFELD acknowledges that (i) is admittedly	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	351.32872009277344	112
recognised by both positivist and post-positivist stances but stresses that (ii) and	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	392.2598419189453	112
6 Richard LEBOW (2000, pp.567-574) proposes a very strong criticism of FERGUSON's overall	144.6999969482422	726.79248046875	9.0	389.2111358642578	113
use of counterfactuals. These criticisms are justified especially as FERGUSON's historical	158.8000030517578	736.6925048828125	9.0	360.2790985107422	113
restrictions would "exclude entire categories of plausible-world counterfactuals" (p.569). The	158.8000030517578	746.6925048828125	9.0	368.5231170654297	113
perspective that I propose hereby is nonetheless still consistent with LEBOW's criteria	158.8000030517578	756.5924682617188	9.0	344.1150665283203	113
(pp.581-585) as I try to adapt counterfactuals to a use specific to more interpretative	158.8000030517578	766.5924682617188	9.0	336.6450958251953	113
perspectives in IR theory and with a precise epistemological articulation.	158.8000030517578	776.4924926757812	9.000003814697266	289.17909240722656	113

(iii) are actually what makes "reflexivity a virtual antonym of positivism"	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	343.58470153808594	116
(pp.40-41). Both elements, in effect, oppose the positivist standpoint about "truth	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	393.10694885253906	116
as correspondence" and science as a "process without a subject". If anyone	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	370.4909210205078	116
committed to a post-positivist perspective can readily agree on the second	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	362.05384826660156	116
element, one has to be careful on the first. NEUFELD's normative and	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	341.94569396972656	116
emancipatory stances, on the one hand, recognise the intersubjective nature of	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	386.33106994628906	116
science (p.42), yet, on the other hand, reassess the necessity of a truth value	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	377.38795471191406	116
which would not be situated anymore in an empirical reality, however constructed	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	395.65895080566406	116
by the cognisant, but through each theories' politico-normative assumptions. In a	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	393.4809112548828	116
paradoxical way, NEUFELD, and many other normativists, actually abide to a	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	376.0458526611328	116
form of "positivism" as they remain attached to a fundamental criteria linked to	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	381.2598419189453	116
the basic principle of "truth as correspondence", "truth" in this case being the	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	374.28590393066406	116
normative requirement of emancipation. Consider the following (p.44):	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	341.46180725097656	116
"[...] reflexive theorists accept incommensurability as the necessary consequence of	167.39999389648438	307.03607177734375	10.0	368.6698303222656	117
the fact that paradigm-specific knowledge-defining standards are themselves	167.39999389648438	321.1361083984375	10.0	338.5999450683594	117
intimately connected to and embedded in competing social and political agendas, the	167.39999389648438	335.3360900878906	10.0	373.5600280761719	117
political-normative contents of which are not amenable to any neutral observation	167.39999389648438	349.43609619140625	10.0	356.8597717285156	117

In other words, since "empirie" does not fit to be a relevant referent as there is no	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	396.5718536376953	118
neutral observation language, contending perspectives cannot be confronted	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	374.57814025878906	118
according to this form of referent. Yet, "reflexive theorists do not accept that	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	369.6988067626953	118
recognizing contending paradigms as incommensurable means reasoned	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	358.26905822753906	118

correspond". Thus, judgement is possible with an admittedly unneutral	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	342.68284606933594	118
observation language which will reasonably evaluate the different "paradigms"	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	380.54481506347656	118
according to a normative referent, that of the emancipatory potential of these	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	374.6818389892578	118
"paradigms". If I supported the idea that this type of normativism can be equated	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	392.99696350097656	118
to "positivism", it was to underline that both perspectives were attached to the	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	377.98194885253906	118
idea of truth, whether "empirical" or "normative", in an epistemic assessment of	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	385.5938262939453	118
the value of a theory. The notion of truth, however, has long been discarded by	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	385.29701232910156	118

by the simple knowledge that all scientific (or normative) inquiry participate in an	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	390.33473205566406	118
open intersubjective discourse. The point of reflexivity in IR theory precisely is to	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	391.4457550048828	118

establish "operative criteria" on the use of certain number of notions (e.g. anarchy	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	398.96998596191406	118

agreement on these criteria (see AGAZZI 1988, p.19). The danger of NEUFELD's	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	398.66188049316406	118
perspective is to reduce IR theory to a mere backup of theories deemed	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	350.8498992919922	118

NEUFELD's predicaments, IR theory had the tendency to consider its own	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	361.43995666503906	123

the scientific inquiry in the tradition of "real science". Mainstream IR theory further	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	398.0128936767578	123

"empirical" or "unbiased", as natural sciences were the actual referent to social	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	384.19691467285156	123

their place in the academic discussion concerning international relations, thus	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	377.8520050048828	124
offering an analysis of IR which takes as a starting point the idea that each	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	364.1768341064453	124
current within our discipline, as any fields of social sciences, or any specific	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	366.81675720214844	124
discursive assessment (a book, an article, a presentation, etc.), can be	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	345.44386291503906	124

both the critical tradition, represented here by NEUFELD, and a more traditional	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	389.0918731689453	124
"disciplinary history" (see HOLDEN 2002). It is, in a way, to ask for an	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	340.03172302246094	124
archaeology of IR theory in all its dimensions. As HOLDEN (2002, p.255)	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	355.89366149902344	124
rightfully noted, there should not be any "privileged vantage-point from which IR's	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	395.8678741455078	124

FOUCAULT (1969) who gave it to his inquiry of discourses some 30 years ago. [36]	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	393.4469757080078	127
An archaeology (FOUCAULT 1969, pp.182-183) is fundamentally not a way to	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	381.5789337158203	128
find a hidden discourse behind the utterance under examination, in a structuralist	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	394.62501525878906	128
sense, but a way to define utterances as such, as "practices obeying to rules". An	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	398.10084533691406	128
archaeology of IR aims to define an utterance within IR discourse in its specificity	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	395.53773498535156	128

ive practices that go beyond the individuals works". An archaeology is, finally, an	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	392.64198303222656	128

tematically depicting the latter as an "object" of inquiry. We clearly see here that	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	389.9058380126953	128

historical perspective. In effect, by paying attention to practices, FOUCAULT	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0162353515625	372.5178985595703	128
wanted to pay attention to "a preconceptual, anonymous, socially sanctioned body	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	392.64698791503906	128

(FLYNN 1994, p.30). This is to be linked to the critical tradition. FOUCAULT's	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	377.31068420410156	128
objective (1969, pp.170-173), however, was also to pay attention to the archive,	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0162353515625	388.2470245361328	128
that is "a practice which raise a multiplicity of utterances as many regular events".	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	397.58375549316406	128
The archive is fundamentally "the general system of the formation and	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	342.6498260498047	128
transformation of the utterances". An archaeology is then the description of "the	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	388.6958770751953	128

to the intellectual-historical tradition. As FLYNN noted (1994, p.30),	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	327.08470153808594	128

that these practices are to be registered as facts, not read as the result of intentions	167.39999389648438	561.736083984375	10.0	368.1996765136719	129

IR theory in the overall sense inspired by FOUCAULT's archaeology. Contextually	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	399.12391662597656	130
speaking, an utterance, such as that of realism in IR theory, has to be considered	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	397.18800354003906	130
as a practice, in the sense given above, taking into account its predicates,	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	360.51390075683594	130
assertions and norms as to retrace both the "internal discursive" and the external	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	394.7130889892578	130

elements delineating an archive and thus subject to both "internal" and "external"	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	394.4551544189453	130
inquiry. This type of work is to a certain extent already at the heart of the present	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	393.41493225097656	130

which has been one of the focus of this paper: IR theory discourse. Who is	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	364.46278381347656	133

reflect monological or dialogical approaches to the cognised or to other	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	346.4929656982422	133
cognisant? How are contextually and expressively constructed the approaches'	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	384.95606994628906	133
archives within IR theory and, more generally, within social sciences? Are these	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	388.4428253173828	133

notion of reflexivity, as presented here, is a way to go beyond the antinomic	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	368.1698760986328	133
perspectives of postmodernism, in which is embedded the idea of deconstruction,	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	397.66505432128906	133
and modernism, in which is embedded the idea of positivist social sciences.	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	368.3788604736328	133
Reflexivity should link the possibility and the necessity of the scientific knowledge	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	395.36195373535156	133
with the idea that any knowledge should be deconstructed as a contingent notion	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	394.49012756347656	133
grounded in political, social, economic and historical dimensions. As accurately	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	384.93202209472656	133

politics of science (knowledge) with that of society (power), is [in the end] to reject	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	398.68385314941406	133

The aim of this section was to underscore the necessity for social sciences, and	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	389.45497131347656	134

As mentioned alongside BAKHTIN (1981, p.351), social sciences possess "the	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	383.76783752441406	134

The process of objectification should then not be equated to a process of	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	356.2239532470703	134
reification in which the cognised becomes a voiceless thing instrumentalised by a	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	395.5420684814453	134
research programme. The cognised, as a subjective self-understanding/repre-	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	381.1630401611328	134
sentation, has to be integrated within IR theory in an epistemological framework,	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	391.6988067626953	134
such as dialogism, which structurally tries to avoid the process of reification and	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	388.6298370361328	134
thus avoid entering in either the "logic of anarchy" or that of "identity". The use of	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	394.03089904785156	134
a counterfactual logic has thus been presented as a complementary way to avoid	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	395.87904357910156	134

the choice of the setting in an hermeneutical locus. Furthermore, dialogism has	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	385.9458770751953	134
been presented in opposition to an apocritical perspective and linked to a fully	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	379.2798614501953	134
reflexive and ongoing appraisal of (i) the cognisant relations to the cognised,	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	372.9108428955078	134
through the problématique and the objectivation; (ii) the cognisant relations to	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.01617431640625	377.8199005126953	134
other cognisant within the intersubjective realm of science. In order to achieve	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	380.15980529785156	134
this goal, it has been underlined that IR theory has to face the task of recognising	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	396.80299377441406	134
itself as a site of cultural practice and thus acknowledge the need of an	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	346.8739471435547	134
archaeology of the discipline and its different currents. A dialogical perspective	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	383.2617950439453	134

The BAKHTINian definition of dialogism—as an interweaving of utterances	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	364.03382873535156	138
characterised by their contextuality, expressivity and relationality—thus unveils an	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	397.85890197753906	138
onto-epistemic dimension designating a process by which any cognised is	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	360.5359344482422	138
accessible to any cognisant as long as it is replaced within its subjective semantic	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	398.0458526611328	138
network and its relationality to other cognised. Accordingly dialogism is not only a	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	395.76881408691406	138
reflexive way by which we can construct knowledge about the social world we	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	377.55287170410156	138
study as cognisant but also a way by which we can analyse and evaluate the	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	374.1979522705078	138
social world we construct as producers of knowledge. This is to follow	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	339.4488067626953	138
BOURDIEU in his opinion that the models used by the cognisant to make sense	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	389.7740020751953	138
of the cognised should also be reflexively applied onto the cognisant him/herself	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	390.22499084472656	138
(BOURDIEU & WACQUANT 1992). The hermeneutical locus has been presented	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	398.64002990722656	138
as a reflexive tool for IR theory as a way to avoid reification and monologism	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	372.4047393798828	138
when the cognisant is constituting his problématique and thus is dealing with the	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0162353515625	391.47901916503906	138
cognised. Furthermore, the hermeneutical locus has been equally portrayed as a	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	394.1740264892578	138
reflexive tool on IR theory in order to provide the discipline with an archaeology	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	384.8457794189453	138
aiming at reconstituting the dialogical relations different IR currents entertain one	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	394.16285705566406	138
with another and to qualify and situate each archive with the IR theory discourse.	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	393.83290100097656	138
These basic conclusions concerning a dialogical approach do not limit	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	341.01893615722656	138
themselves to the sole field of IR theory. All fields of social sciences might benefit	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	396.98976135253906	138
from a more reflexive approach whether to their "subject"/ "object" of study or to	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	389.27894592285156	138
their own discipline itself. A greater epistemological self-consciousness and self-	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	391.58888244628906	138
assertiveness within any type of problématique or research design might prove to	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0162353515625	396.36903381347656	138
be a heuristic drive to improve and better delineate the definition of some arch-	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	384.5269317626953	138
concept such as power or identity, as such concepts should reflexively be	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	358.0718536376953	138
connected to the problématique at work. [40]	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0162353515625	218.04701232910156	138
It is important to note that a dialogical perspective does not seek to provide the	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	384.69190979003906	139
only framework by which subjectivity and reflexivity would be better integrated in	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	390.3568878173828	139
IR theory. NEUFELD's attempt (1995) is only but one other framework according	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	393.23902893066406	139
to which subjectivity and reflexivity can be addressed within IR. NEUFELD,	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	364.0666961669922	139
however, is an epitome of the danger of such an integration if one wants to	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	365.2989044189453	139
situate reflexivity and subjectivity at the heart of scientific inquiry. To situate such	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	393.65675354003906	139
notions within scientific inquiry is admittedly a normative assumption as to know	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	388.2667999267578	139
what is the core of the social sciences composed of. Furthermore, within IR	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	367.4657745361328	139
theory, it is to normatively reject monological account of the cognised. But the	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	378.5648956298828	139
overall aim of a scientific inquiry, contrary to NEUFELD's politico-normative	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	365.78260803222656	139
perspective, is to constitute a body of knowledge within an open and	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	333.1789093017578	139
intersubjective discussion (AGAZZI 1988) and not to promote any ideological	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	374.79188537597656	139
agenda. To integrate the idea of subjectivity and reflexivity precisely is to	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	354.2547149658203	139
constitute a body of knowledge that is self-aware, through its own archaeology, of	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	398.1228790283203	139
its bias and limitations. Positivist perspectives, as well as constructivist or critical	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	390.93971252441406	139
perspectives, within IR have to take account for the specific characterisation of	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	383.2948760986328	139
their "object of study" and to focalise on the process of their interactions and	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	372.0858917236328	139
interrelations. A dialogical approach, as I showed, offers such an overall	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	351.2848358154297	139
perspective and is specifically designed to tackle the specific nexus between	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	372.86683654785156	139
