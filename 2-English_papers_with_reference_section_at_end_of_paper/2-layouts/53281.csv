Background and Aim: Present research intends to investigate relationship of psychological	98.9439926147461	328.92413330078125	11.040008544921875	425.32865142822266	8
hardiness with work holism among high school teachers. Methods: The under study society includes all	70.62399291992188	341.5241394042969	11.040008544921875	453.6502990722656	8
male and female high school teacher in Ghorveh city in the academic year 2012-2013. Using simple	70.62399291992188	354.244140625	11.040008544921875	453.7322082519531	8
random sampling method, a sample size of 100 male and female teachers was selected. To collect data,	70.62399291992188	366.8441467285156	11.040008544921875	453.5232849121094	8
Kobassa Psychological Hardiness Questionnaire and Aghabeigi Workaholics Questionnaire were	70.62399291992188	379.4441223144531	11.040008544921875	453.7287902832031	8
employed. To analyze the data, descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage, mean and standard	70.62399291992188	392.16412353515625	11.040008544921875	453.6341247558594	8
deviation) and inferential statistics (t-test and regression analysis) were used. Results: The findings	70.62399291992188	404.7841491699219	11.040008544921875	453.6532897949219	8
indicated that there is negative and significant relationship between the variables psychological	70.62399291992188	417.504150390625	11.040008544921875	453.3686828613281	8
hardiness and work holism. In addition, there is association between gender and psychological hardiness	70.62399291992188	430.1041259765625	11.040008544921875	453.5413513183594	8
and between gender and work holism, also the constituents of psychological hardiness (commitment,	70.62399291992188	442.7041320800781	11.040008544921875	453.5995178222656	8
control and challenge) are able to predict work holism.	70.62399291992188	455.42413330078125	11.040008544921875	240.859619140625	8

1. INTRODUCTION	70.62399291992188	538.8914794921875	12.0	111.01199340820312	10
Psychological hardiness is one of the elements which play a basic role in man’s life	98.9439926147461	566.281494140625	12.0	425.4360122680664	11
quality and to create a balance among different dimensions of it .People who have low hardiness	70.62399291992188	580.0814819335938	11.999984741210938	453.6720275878906	11
will hurt more by harmful elements in long term while people with high hardiness apparently	70.62399291992188	593.8814697265625	12.0	453.5879821777344	11
have natural or acquirable security against the stressfulelements. Hardiness is the ability to	70.62399291992188	607.6814575195312	12.0	453.4719543457031	11
understand the external conditions accurately and to make a desirable decision about oneself	70.62399291992188	621.4814453125	12.0	453.7079162597656	11
(Jomhari, 2002). Kobasa (1979) introduce the hardiness as a complicated personal characteristic	70.62399291992188	635.281494140625	12.0	453.5559997558594	11
which is formed by three constituents: challenge, control and commitment which are supposed	70.62399291992188	649.0814819335938	12.0	453.6999816894531	11
as a set acting as mediators to mediate stress effect as the recognition situation are changing	70.62399291992188	662.8814697265625	12.0	453.8040466308594	11
and the stressful facts of life are decreasing (Sabri and Abdkhodai, 2010). Hardiness is mainly	70.62399291992188	676.6814575195312	12.0	453.7480163574219	11
relates to the adjustment and positive agreement encountering problems and difficulties	70.62399291992188	690.4814453125	12.0	453.5320739746094	11
(Issacson, 2002). Researchers believe that hardiness and vulnerability are two opposite poles of	70.62399291992188	704.281494140625	12.0	453.6999816894531	11
a same continuum (Fergus and Zemmerman 2005). Other researchers studied common features	70.62399291992188	718.1014404296875	12.0	453.6520080566406	11
in people with hardiness includes: higher self-ruling, independency, sympathy, job	70.62399291992188	731.9014892578125	12.0	453.6720275878906	11
commitment, endeavor, good problem, solving skills and good relationship with colleagues	70.62399291992188	745.7014770507812	12.0	453.3820495605469	11

(Issacson, 2002). Kobasa and Maddi (1982) state that people are very resistant to the mental	70.62399291992188	99.04150390625	12.0	453.5139465332031	15
pressure and under the stressful situations not only don’t hurt mentally but also they welcome	70.62399291992188	112.84149169921875	12.0	453.6120300292969	15
them and believe that these situations are necessary for their development in life. Moreover,	70.62399291992188	126.6414794921875	12.0	453.7120056152344	15
their studies about companies and graduated students showed that people who have a harden	70.62399291992188	140.44146728515625	12.0	453.6720275878906	15
personalities will experience less mental pressure and they will not be threat by mental pressure	70.62399291992188	154.24151611328125	12.0	453.5521545410156	15
(Kobasa and Maddi 1982). Researchers indicated that hardiness has a positive relationshipwith	70.62399291992188	168.04150390625	12.0	453.6840515136719	15
physical and mental disorder (Brooks 2003). Considering hardiness as a acquirable feature not	70.62399291992188	181.84149169921875	12.0	453.5379943847656	15
mainly an inherent one (lambert 2007). Learning hardiness increase commitment, control and	70.62399291992188	195.6414794921875	12.0	453.7840270996094	15
challenge rates, the effects of each separately or in combination can decrease the rate of	70.62399291992188	209.44146728515625	12.0	453.4539489746094	15
recognized stress (Nasiri, 2010). Kobasa (1979) believes that it can enforce person ability to	70.62399291992188	223.24151611328125	12.0	453.4720153808594	15
control situation ,to commit duties and to encounter events .Various studies have shown that	70.62399291992188	237.04150390625	12.0	453.6039733886719	15
hardiness has a positive relationship with people mental health (Maddi and khoshaba, 1994) ,it	70.62399291992188	250.87152099609375	12.0	453.7679748535156	15
decrease stress (Shapperand ;Kashani 1999) and that hardiness has a positive relationship with	70.62399291992188	264.6715087890625	12.0	453.4939880371094	15
people physical and mental health (Florian et al 1995).	70.62399291992188	278.47149658203125	12.0	262.2699890136719	15
The results of king et al; (1998) showed that people with hardiness evaluate unpleasant	98.9439926147461	292.271484375	12.0	425.1879653930664	15
situations in a challenging manner than threatening one and have more commitment to	70.62399291992188	306.07147216796875	12.0	453.6159973144531	15
themselves and their works and experience more sense of control in their lives. Kobasa (1979)	70.62399291992188	319.87152099609375	11.999969482421875	453.7200012207031	15
has integrated three attributes:commitment, control and challenge all of which have originated	70.62399291992188	333.67144775390625	12.0	453.5020446777344	15
from the existing philosophy. She has described hardiness as a shield against diseases (Jomhari,	70.62399291992188	347.4714660644531	12.0	453.6960144042969	15
2002).	70.62399291992188	361.2714538574219	12.0	30.996002197265625	15
This is one of the main aspects of the personal control “personal efficiency”. This concept	98.9439926147461	375.07147216796875	12.0	425.2120132446289	16
has been presented by Albert Bandura (1997), people who have this characteristic believe that	70.62399291992188	388.8714599609375	12.0	453.6579895019531	16
they can do everything successfully (Majidian, 2004). The challenging people serve life	70.62399291992188	402.69146728515625	12.0	453.5380554199219	16
changes as challenges or opportunities to development not as limitations or threats (Kobasa	70.62399291992188	416.491455078125	12.0	453.6120300292969	16
1979). In addition, people with hardiness undergo less physical erosion in stressful conditions	70.62399291992188	430.2914733886719	12.0	453.5920104980469	16
(Majidian, 2004). Work holism forms a great deal of man’s life as well as work engages people	70.62399291992188	444.0914611816406	12.0	453.7080383300781	16
in itself both physically and cognitively. However, the business turbulent world exerts	70.62399291992188	457.8914489746094	12.0	453.6520080566406	16
numerous pressures on the business owners. Today organizations are dwindling in size and	70.62399291992188	471.69146728515625	12.0	453.7120666503906	16
rebuilding that increase expectations and working demands and also it increase working hours	70.62399291992188	485.491455078125	12.0	453.3680114746094	16
(Schaufeli; et al; 2009).The term work holism has been presented first by Oates; 1971. He	70.62399291992188	499.2914733886719	12.0	453.6479797363281	16
described this term as an uncontrollable need or obligation and driven to work continuously.	70.62399291992188	513.0914306640625	12.0	443.1999816894531	16
This definition involves two constituents:extreme work, extreme tendency; to spend more	98.9439926147461	526.8914794921875	12.0	425.27201080322266	16
time to work than what the organization expects them to achieve its goals. The later indicates	70.62399291992188	540.6914672851562	12.0	453.6840515136719	16
that work holists always and permanently think about work, even when they are not at work. In	70.62399291992188	554.491455078125	12.0	453.5759582519531	16
other word, work holist’s mind usually engage in affaires relateto the work. These two	70.62399291992188	568.3214721679688	12.0	453.5639953613281	16
compartments as the behavioral and cognitive elements of work holism point to the root of the	70.62399291992188	582.1214599609375	12.0	453.5541076660156	16
work holism that is just consistent with the alcoholism (Oates 1971). One of the job concepts	70.62399291992188	595.9214477539062	12.0	453.5080261230469	16
that have been presented in academic and organizational environments since 1970s is “work	70.62399291992188	609.721435546875	12.0	453.3918762207031	16
holism”. Some researchers equalize work holism with other types of addiction and draw it with	70.62399291992188	623.521484375	12.0	453.3240051269531	16
unhappy, sad or sensitive forms that person cannot do his work best and cause some problems	70.62399291992188	637.3214721679688	12.0	453.4660949707031	16
to his colleagues too (Agha Beigi 2007). It is believed that work holists do work more than what	70.62399291992188	651.1214599609375	12.0	453.5659484863281	16
is expected and do more efforts in a way that ignore their lives out of their job. Therefore it	70.62399291992188	664.9214477539062	12.0	453.5799865722656	16
should be mentioned that the most evident feature of work holists is that they work more than	70.62399291992188	678.721435546875	12.0	453.1799621582031	16
what is necessary ( Buelens and Palman 2004). In general, work holism is defined as spending	70.62399291992188	692.521484375	12.0	453.5859680175781	16
a considerable amount of time to work; that is continuous cognitive engagement along with	70.62399291992188	706.3214721679688	11.999992370605469	453.5379943847656	16
preferring work during leisure time. (snir and Zohar 2008). To differentiate overworking results	70.62399291992188	720.1414794921875	12.0	453.5979919433594	16

engage in work even when they are at the exercising or recreational activities. These people	70.62399291992188	181.84149169921875	12.0	453.3500061035156	19
engage their minds in working problems (Ahmadi et al 2010). Work holism is an unsatisfying	70.62399291992188	195.6414794921875	12.0	453.7600402832031	19
kind of need to work during which the following indications are remarkable: like other addicts	70.62399291992188	209.44146728515625	12.0	453.4540100097656	19
these people underestimate their working hours and ignore the overall time that they engage	70.62399291992188	223.24151611328125	12.0	453.2640686035156	19
themselves in problems relate to the work at home or weekends.	70.62399291992188	237.04150390625	12.0	308.19598388671875	19
These people ignore their spouse and children needs and serve their complaints as seeking	98.9439926147461	250.87152099609375	12.0	425.34403228759766	19
excuse or demanding. Depression: Totally, these people don’t feel excitement and liveliness.	70.62399291992188	264.6715087890625	12.0	453.3580627441406	19
Reality distortion: In many cases, these patients are actually unaware of what they are doing	70.62399291992188	278.47149658203125	12.0	453.8040466308594	19
and think that their unreasonable reactions are reasonable. Reduced self-confidence: Despite	70.62399291992188	292.271484375	12.0	453.7320251464844	19
remarkable economic successes, these people apparently are powerful and self-confined but	70.62399291992188	306.07147216796875	12.0	453.6399841308594	19
mentally they are unstable and weak which is need to control. This is another defending reaction	70.62399291992188	319.87152099609375	11.999969482421875	453.6399841308594	19
of these people who want to satisfy their absence with excuse seeking when they are attendant.	70.62399291992188	333.67144775390625	12.0	453.3240661621094	19
As a satisfactory reaction they are oversensitive to what has happened at home during their	70.62399291992188	347.4714660644531	12.0	453.6519470214844	19
absences. Unfortunately, they analyze problems pessimistically (Snir and Harpaz 2006). Scott	70.62399291992188	361.2714538574219	12.0	453.7560119628906	19
et al; (1997) also identified three models of workholism include: radical drive (scrupulous),	70.62399291992188	375.07147216796875	12.0	453.6639709472656	19
perfectionism and prosperous. In their opinion work holists have a high degree of scruple, stress	70.62399291992188	388.8714599609375	12.0	453.6600646972656	19
and anxiety.	70.62399291992188	402.69146728515625	12.0	58.555999755859375	19
Their work cause physical and mental problems, they have little satisfaction of their job	98.9439926147461	416.491455078125	12.0	425.30204010009766	19
and lives and their job performance are low. Perfectionist work holists have high level of stress	70.62399291992188	430.2914733886719	12.0	453.5520935058594	19
and physical or mental problems, they have hostile and inefficient interrelationships, they have	70.62399291992188	444.0914611816406	12.0	453.6239929199219	19
more arbitrary absence and also they have lower job satisfaction and performance. Finally,	70.62399291992188	457.8914489746094	12.0	453.6840515136719	19
prosperous work holists have lower life and job satisfaction, physical and mental health, job	70.62399291992188	471.69146728515625	12.0	453.8160095214844	19
performance and high organizational citizenship behaviors and lower stress and arbitrary	70.62399291992188	485.491455078125	12.0	453.5899353027344	19
service absence. Regarding the typology of work holism by Spence and Robins (1992) work	70.62399291992188	499.2914733886719	12.0	453.3960266113281	19
holism is characterized based on the amount of these three constituents: Feeling of being driven	70.62399291992188	513.0914306640625	12.0	453.6400451660156	19
to work, work involvement and work enjoyment. In work holists the rate of feeling of being	70.62399291992188	526.8914794921875	12.0	453.3200378417969	19
driven to work is high, they have very high tendency to work but they don’t enjoy it. In contrast,	70.62399291992188	540.6914672851562	12.0	453.6600036621094	19
people who are keen to work will engage in it while they feel enjoyment and don’t have an	70.62399291992188	554.491455078125	12.0	453.4520568847656	19
extreme drive. Moreover, they found that work holists experience higher job stress than others.	70.62399291992188	568.3214721679688	12.0	453.8040466308594	19
Work holism can have different effects on people psychological and physical health and their	70.62399291992188	582.1214599609375	12.0	453.5199279785156	19
relatives. The most common consequences of the work holism is to create a high level of job	70.62399291992188	595.9214477539062	12.0	453.4681091308594	19

researches in this area and the author points to some researches in which two concepts of	70.62399291992188	664.9214477539062	12.0	453.2518615722656	19
hardiness and addiction are presented as it was specified that work holism itself is a subconcept	70.62399291992188	678.721435546875	12.0	453.6600036621094	19
of addiction in its general form.Snir and Harpaz (2006) suggested that the probability of men	70.62399291992188	692.521484375	12.0	453.5199890136719	19
works holism is more than women. Mohammad talebi (2008) in has study show the relationship	70.62399291992188	706.3214721679688	11.999992370605469	453.6399841308594	19
between the organizational culture and work holism, Asgari, Mostafa (2002) has studied the	70.62399291992188	720.1414794921875	12.0	453.5320129394531	19

As it can be seen from Table 5 and regarding the obtained t scores, there is a significant	98.9439926147461	445.4114685058594	12.0	425.1640396118164	147
relationship among married and unmarried teachers in their hardiness; it means that the rate of	70.62399291992188	459.2114562988281	12.0	453.5439147949219	147
hardiness and work holism among married teachers is more than unmarried ones.	70.62399291992188	473.011474609375	12.0	389.7720031738281	147

Findings indicated that there is a negative and significant relationship between hardiness	98.9439926147461	542.011474609375	12.0	425.09806060791016	149
and work holism and the higher the hardiness, the lower the work holism and vice versa.	70.62399291992188	555.8414306640625	12.0	424.9720458984375	149
These results showed that people with hardiness are very resistant to the mental stress and	98.9439926147461	569.6414794921875	12.0	425.34403228759766	149
they don’t hurt mentally under the influence of the stressful situations (Kobasa and Madi; 1982).	70.62399291992188	583.4414672851562	12.0	453.6960144042969	149
This research showed that hardiness has a negative correlation with drug and alcohol addiction	70.62399291992188	597.241455078125	12.0	453.3480529785156	149
whether in the past or present. In addition, this research results are consistent with the results	70.62399291992188	611.0414428710938	12.0	453.6720275878906	149
from Brooks (2003) and Florian et al (1995) study about the positive relationship between	70.62399291992188	624.8414306640625	12.0	453.3860168457031	149
hardiness and physical or mental health. Shaparandand Kashani (1999); Rash et al (1995) and	70.62399291992188	638.6414794921875	12.0	453.6640319824219	149
Majidian (2004) about the negative relationship between hardiness and stress; King et al (1998)	70.62399291992188	652.4414672851562	12.0	453.8519592285156	149
believes that people with hardiness evaluate the unsatisfying situations in a challenging manner	70.62399291992188	666.241455078125	12.0	453.5559997558594	149
not threateningly and they have more commitment about themselves and their work, also they	70.62399291992188	680.0414428710938	12.0	453.7919616699219	149
experience more sense of control in their lives.	70.62399291992188	693.8414306640625	12.0	224.44802856445312	149
The results confirmed the previous findings by researchers such as Spence and Robins	98.9439926147461	707.6414794921875	12.0	425.29605865478516	149
(1992), Asgari (2002), Jomhari (2002), Scott et al (1997) and Pitroswki – Vodanovich (2008).	70.62399291992188	721.4614868164062	12.0	453.6520080566406	149
Therefore to validate this relationship, it can be point to the mediating role of hardiness in	70.62399291992188	735.261474609375	12.0	453.5919494628906	149
mental stress effects to create physical and mental disorders. Today, mental stress is served as	70.62399291992188	749.0614624023438	12.0	453.2401428222656	149

a revealing indicator in mental disorders. It also has a significant role in some mental disorders	70.62399291992188	99.04150390625	12.0	453.5559997558594	152
such as anxiety. Other researches show that people with high rate of hardiness encounter	70.62399291992188	112.84149169921875	12.0	453.2280578613281	152
stressful situations more effectively, for example by processing problems or converting	70.62399291992188	126.6414794921875	12.0	453.4439392089844	152
situations to the positive ones. Moreover, these people are less involve in physical erosion in	70.62399291992188	140.44146728515625	12.0	453.4300842285156	152
stressful conditions (Majidian, 2004). Of the other results was the hardiness difference among	70.62399291992188	154.24151611328125	12.0	453.6099548339844	152
males and females, so that the rate of hardiness in males was more than females, Which is	70.62399291992188	168.04150390625	12.0	453.7120666503906	152
consistent with the findings of Ahadi et al (2008), Kobasa et al (1982).	70.62399291992188	181.84149169921875	12.0	339.3160095214844	152
With respect to the fact that women have more talent to depression (twice the men),	98.9439926147461	195.6414794921875	12.0	425.06400299072266	152
hardiness is a resistant shield against it (Sheppard, Kashani 1999). It can be pointed that men	70.62399291992188	209.44146728515625	12.0	453.4719543457031	152
are more involve in the internal elements in life events, while women are more involve in	70.62399291992188	223.24151611328125	12.0	453.5540466308594	152
external elements. In addition, there is a significant relationship between hardiness and marriage	70.62399291992188	237.04150390625	12.0	453.4938659667969	152
status, as the rate of hardiness is higher in married people, which is consistent with the findings	70.62399291992188	250.87152099609375	12.0	453.5440368652344	152
of Ahadi et al (2008).	70.62399291992188	264.6715087890625	12.0	103.58599853515625	152
This is probably originated from the fact that married people have more responsibilities	98.9439926147461	278.47149658203125	12.0	425.1600112915039	152
comparing with unmarried ones. Most of them believe that they are not mainly belonging to	70.62399291992188	292.271484375	12.0	453.5519714355469	152
themselves, but their families also are involved in their decisions and behaviors. It seems that	70.62399291992188	306.07147216796875	12.0	453.3119201660156	152
they try to not serve the life events as boring and threatening and they usually try to make a	70.62399291992188	319.87152099609375	11.999969482421875	453.1800842285156	152
dynamic life based on the exalted goal for themselves and their families. One other result was	70.62399291992188	333.67144775390625	12.0	453.4839782714844	152
the difference between male and female as the rate of work holism in females was more than	70.62399291992188	347.4714660644531	12.0	453.2400207519531	152
males that is not consistent (Snir and Harpaz; 2006). To confirm this, some believe that men	70.62399291992188	361.2714538574219	12.0	453.5320129394531	152
are more involve in the internal elements, while women are more involve in the external	70.62399291992188	375.07147216796875	12.0	453.5140075683594	152
elements of life events.	70.62399291992188	388.8714599609375	12.0	111.18000793457031	152
The leading theory conclude that the work holists accept some effects that are always	98.9439926147461	402.69146728515625	12.0	424.87198638916016	152
enforcing, like admiration or criticism which cause to sustain behaviors relate to the work	70.62399291992188	416.491455078125	12.0	453.3679504394531	152
holism (Mc Milan et al 2003). One of the research limitations was the lack of a similar research	70.62399291992188	430.2914733886719	12.0	453.5020446777344	152
in this area and relates to the topic in Iran and abroad; also this topic was new as there had been	70.62399291992188	444.0914611816406	12.0	453.5440368652344	152
found no similar research in scientific-searching databases, so there was not enough	70.62399291992188	457.8914489746094	12.0	453.6280212402344	152
background. One other limitation in the study was the use of usual samples (As they didn’t	70.62399291992188	471.69146728515625	12.0	453.4960632324219	152
consult to a consulting center and stated no complaint).	70.62399291992188	485.491455078125	12.0	264.87603759765625	152
Also it was assumed that the work holist’s performances on a continuum have many	98.9439926147461	499.2914733886719	12.0	425.4839859008789	152
similarities in clinic and non-clinic populations. Anyway, the findings obtained from healthy	70.62399291992188	513.0914306640625	12.0	453.6819763183594	152
samples should be considered remarkably to use this tool in other researches with clinic samples	70.62399291992188	526.8914794921875	12.0	453.7920837402344	152
(they had consult to a center and stated a complaint). It is suggested that researchers examine	70.62399291992188	540.6914672851562	12.0	453.4539489746094	152
the relationship between hardiness and work holism in occupational, industrial and trading	70.62399291992188	554.491455078125	12.0	453.3479919433594	152
groups. Also it can be useful to study a questionnaire with populations of various ages	70.62399291992188	568.3214721679688	12.0	453.2641296386719	152
(teenagers, middle-aged and old); some workshops can be made to teach hardiness and being	70.62399291992188	582.1214599609375	12.0	453.5260925292969	152
