Nauck argues that research on intergenerational solidarity and ambivalence suggests that	107.760986328125	472.1576843261719	10.5	379.8166198730469	16
intergenerational relationships in wealthy societies are composed of both emotional	107.76080322265625	484.1576843261719	10.5	379.8583679199219	16

Nauck has identified four latent classes of intergenerational relationships (‘ambivalent’,	107.76080322265625	520.158447265625	10.5	379.83062744140625	16

data show that affection and conflict in intergenerational relationships are (apart from op-	107.76080322265625	556.158447265625	10.5	379.84539794921875	16

Parenting and attachment. Katarzyna Lubiewska notes that past research has shown that	107.75958251953125	422.1769104003906	10.5	379.802001953125	21
transmission of attachment is mainly associated with the quality of parenting (e.g., van	107.75959777832031	434.1769104003906	10.5	379.7462921142578	21

erations, Lubiewska is now interested in the role of grandmothers and fathers in the	107.75958251953125	458.1777038574219	10.5	379.8393249511719	21

in Poland. Results of first analyses indicate that a prediction of adolescents’ attachment	107.75938415527344	506.177734375	10.5	379.87977600097656	21

ers than for adolescents. Regarding intergenerational transmission of values it was found	107.76033020019531	332.1823425292969	10.5	379.82102966308594	26
that collectivistic values were more strongly transmitted from parent to child, whereas	107.76033020019531	344.1823425292969	10.5	379.9530487060547	26
