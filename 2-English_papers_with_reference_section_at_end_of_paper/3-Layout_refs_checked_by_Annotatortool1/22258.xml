participation in the formal sector, yet a higher proportion of women	130.62091064453125	353.4472351074219	8.970001220703125	276.4599304199219	6
professors than in any of the 25 European Union countries. We use a range of	130.62091064453125	365.9002990722656	8.970001220703125	320.1617126464844	6

hierarchical achievements in Turkey. However, the explanation is multilayered	130.62091064453125	428.1656188964844	8.970001220703125	318.19281005859375	6
and lies in the cumulative and interrelated effect of state policy, institutional	130.62091064453125	440.6186828613281	8.970001220703125	311.4877624511719	6

At the end of 2004, the EU agreed to open accession talks which could	130.62060546875	525.9368896484375	10.459991455078125	322.7642517089844	8
lead to Turkey’s membership of the Union. Its candidacy, if successful,	130.62060546875	538.3905029296875	10.459991455078125	322.7799072265625	8

tion, which has been central to Turkey’s dominant state ideology. Turkey	130.62060546875	563.2978515625	10.459991455078125	322.7914123535156	8
is often excluded from comparative studies of European employment, yet	130.62060546875	575.7515258789062	10.460006713867188	322.7830505371094	8
there are good reasons to include it.	130.62060546875	588.2052001953125	10.460006713867188	160.68020629882812	8
There are important paradoxes in employment relations in Turkey:	141.08164978027344	600.6588745117188	10.460006713867188	312.3157501220703	8
women have one of the lowest rates of employment participation in	130.62060546875	613.112548828125	10.460006713867188	322.78094482421875	8

be envied by their European sisters. In particular, women achieve more	130.62060546875	638.0198974609375	10.460006713867188	322.7767639160156	8
hierarchically in the professions and academia than their contemporaries	130.62060546875	650.4735717773438	10.460006713867188	322.7861022949219	8

of discrimination against women. In practice, the impact of anti-	141.6177978515625	153.299072265625	10.4599609375	322.7924499511719	12
discriminatory legislation is often limited to widening women’s access to	141.6177978515625	165.75274658203125	10.4599609375	322.7872314453125	12
employment, but has had less success in challenging vertical segregation.	141.6177978515625	178.2064208984375	10.4599609375	322.7736511230469	12
In Turkey, by contrast, anti-discrimination legislation is less advanced,	141.6177978515625	190.66009521484375	10.4599609375	322.774658203125	12
but vertical segregation is lower. We examine this paradox by comparing	141.6177978515625	203.11376953125	10.4599609375	322.7862243652344	12

Before turning to these, we pursue a more generic explanation: women	141.6177978515625	377.4651794433594	10.459991455078125	322.76751708984375	52

male respondents mentioned family affairs as hindering their promotion	130.62060546875	178.2064208984375	10.4599609375	322.77783203125	82
(one stated that ‘I’m involved in my own academic tasks usually, some-	130.62060546875	190.66009521484375	10.4599609375	322.78094482421875	82

recognize structural barriers. They reported that they were largely	130.62060546875	215.56744384765625	10.4599609375	322.774658203125	82

The following statement by a female professor is typical: ‘Actually	141.08164978027344	265.38214111328125	10.4599609375	312.32518005371094	82

I believe that there is equality between the sexes. However, once you	154.53089904785156	324.43768310546875	9.46002197265625	276.04933166503906	83
enter the academic profession, the difﬁculties they [women and men] face	154.53089904785156	335.8946838378906	9.46002197265625	295.13392639160156	83
are different. However much men help, responsibilities of caring for the	154.53089904785156	347.3516845703125	9.46002197265625	288.6065216064453	83
family and children are expected of women . . . It is very positive for a	154.53089904785156	358.8086853027344	9.46002197265625	280.7036895751953	83

The paradox is complicated by the expectation that women will marry	141.08140563964844	402.3641357421875	10.459991455078125	312.31883239746094	84

pool of potential partners. Accordingly, some 41 percent of women	130.620361328125	427.271484375	10.459991455078125	322.7736511230469	84
academics are married to other academics (Özkanli and Korkmaz, 2000:	130.620361328125	439.72515869140625	10.459991455078125	322.7705383300781	84

Female respondents recognized gendered structural constraints for	141.08140563964844	526.90087890625	10.459991455078125	312.31675720214844	84

advancement in the sector. One male professor stated that barriers to	130.620361328125	564.261962890625	10.459991455078125	322.7767639160156	84

saw marriage and childcare as important barriers to women’s career	130.620361328125	589.1692504882812	10.460006713867188	322.7830505371094	84
development. Neither marriage nor childcare appeared to constitute a	130.620361328125	601.6229248046875	10.460006713867188	322.7798156738281	84

Women respondents appreciated men’s help and contribution to their	141.08140563964844	626.5302734375	10.460006713867188	312.3157196044922	84

moving to gender equality. As Esping-Andersen (2002: 124) argues,	141.6178436279297	290.28912353515625	10.4599609375	322.81336975097656	88

Women in Turkey face further structures of gendered discrimination, yet	141.6178436279297	377.46270751953125	10.459991455078125	322.7778778076172	90

dents. When asked about barriers that they faced as academic workers,	141.6178436279297	402.37005615234375	10.459991455078125	322.7766876220703	90
there was, however, a gendered variation. Many male professors claimed	141.6178436279297	414.82373046875	10.459991455078125	322.77366638183594	90

the negative effects of discrimination.	130.62060546875	489.54071044921875	10.459991455078125	167.41436767578125	96
We have concentrated on Turkey, but we recognize that some of the	141.08164978027344	501.9943542480469	10.459991455078125	312.31153869628906	96

contradiction between women’s low labour market participation and	130.62060546875	539.35546875	10.459991455078125	322.7851257324219	96
their success in the professions, which seems counter-intuitive to the	130.62060546875	551.80908203125	10.459991455078125	322.77880859375	96
western eye. Most western commentators seek remedial measures for	130.62060546875	564.2628173828125	10.459991455078125	322.78094482421875	96
gendered discrimination in the strengthening of legislation. For Turkey,	130.62060546875	576.7164306640625	10.460006713867188	322.7779235839844	96
this class of women beneﬁted not from legislation, but from a strong state	130.62060546875	589.1701049804688	10.460006713867188	322.7778015136719	96
ideology of equality. This ‘state feminism’ resulted from the rupture with	130.62060546875	601.623779296875	10.460006713867188	322.7841491699219	96
the Ottoman Empire in 1923. Thus revolutionary change transformed the	130.62060546875	614.0774536132812	10.460006713867188	322.7778015136719	96

Academic women felt the impact of this transformation. At the insti-	141.08164978027344	638.9848022460938	10.460006713867188	312.32835388183594	96
tutional level, it was underpinned with the introduction of YÖK: the	130.62060546875	651.4384765625	10.460006713867188	322.7778015136719	96

with the interpretation by Reskin and Roos (1990) of the feminization of	141.6177978515625	215.56744384765625	10.4599609375	322.77471923828125	100

Esping-Andersen (2002) argues that there exists a broad consensus on	152.07884216308594	452.1872253417969	10.459991455078125	312.3083953857422	100
what constitutes women-friendly policy. It includes affordable day care,	141.6177978515625	464.6408996582031	10.459991455078125	322.77984619140625	100

and the ability to match work with school hours. But he adds that this is	141.6177978515625	489.5482482910156	10.459991455078125	322.7746887207031	100

since it demonstrates the importance of state ideology in promoting	130.620361328125	153.299072265625	10.4599609375	322.77996826171875	104
gender equality. The explanation of Turkish women’s academic success is	130.620361328125	165.75274658203125	10.4599609375	322.7757568359375	104
multilayered and lies in the cumulative and interrelated effect of state	130.620361328125	178.2064208984375	10.4599609375	322.783935546875	104

home–work interface, and the agency of the professors themselves. This	130.620361328125	203.11376953125	10.4599609375	322.7715759277344	104
example is, nevertheless, not typical of Turkish women’s labour market	130.620361328125	215.56744384765625	10.4599609375	322.7778015136719	104

experience of a highly educated and privileged elite. This does not negate	130.620361328125	240.47479248046875	10.4599609375	322.7684326171875	104
the importance of their experience; after all, it is such women who are at	130.620361328125	252.928466796875	10.4599609375	322.77880859375	104

The Turkish example suggests that the legislatively focused European	130.620361328125	277.8358154296875	10.4599609375	322.76953125	104
