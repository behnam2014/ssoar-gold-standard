there is a growing discrepancy between the actively developing trade and	127.61943054199219	669.824951171875	10.979995727539062	340.2152557373047	13
foreign policy relations, which are approaching the ‘freezing point’. In 2007,	127.61943054199219	682.4244995117188	10.979995727539062	340.18455505371094	13
this discrepancy formed a steady tendency, since trade was developing to the	127.61943054199219	695.0844116210938	10.979995727539062	340.1625518798828	13

The favourable vector of international relations development reached its	144.5994873046875	226.24395751953125	10.98004150390625	323.1864318847656	16
maximum in 1997 when, finally, the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation	127.62002563476562	238.843505859375	10.98004150390625	340.1537780761719	16
Agreement, signed in 1994, came into effect. At that moment, the Treaty of	127.62001037597656	251.50341796875	10.98004150390625	340.1768341064453	16
Amsterdam defined the constitutional (contractual) principles of the EU	127.6199951171875	264.163330078125	10.98004150390625	340.1373596191406	16

Relations with Russia were considered a general foreign policy project	144.59947204589844	289.483154296875	10.98004150390625	323.1710662841797	16

the same time it would be a “pilot project” to test new mechanisms of the	127.618896484375	314.74261474609375	10.98004150390625	340.07147216796875	16
interaction of the EU (as a body) with the outer world. It was crucial to find	127.618896484375	327.402587890625	10.97998046875	340.151611328125	16
such a project, because the difficulty of the EU common policy development	127.618896484375	340.0625	10.980010986328125	340.11309814453125	16
consists in contradictory foreign policy interests of different states, first of	127.618896484375	352.72247314453125	10.97998046875	340.05828857421875	16
all, Germany, France and the UK. But, since all the EU member states are	127.618896484375	365.322021484375	10.97998046875	340.090087890625	16
interested in the predictability of Russia, the provision of this predictability	127.618896484375	377.98193359375	10.980010986328125	340.129638671875	16
is the most evident first priority project of the new common foreign policy	127.61891174316406	390.64190673828125	10.97998046875	340.0417938232422	16

icy. The first “common strategy” (adopted in June 1999) was the programme	127.61891174316406	428.6217041015625	10.980010986328125	340.12522888183594	16
aimed at the development of democracy and market competition in Russia.	127.61891174316406	441.22125244140625	10.980010986328125	340.1999053955078	16
In general, it was expected by means of joint efforts it would be possible to	127.61891174316406	453.8812255859375	10.97998046875	340.13511657714844	16
influence Russia in the same way Western victorious powers influenced the	127.618896484375	466.5411376953125	10.980010986328125	340.21746826171875	16
development of post-war Germany and Japan, aspiring to the establishment	127.618896484375	479.20111083984375	10.97998046875	340.0989074707031	16

neighbour policy. It is well-know that states with democratically elected	127.618896484375	504.4605407714844	10.980010986328125	340.255859375	16
governments cannot allow themselves to be at enmity with each other.	127.618896484375	517.1205444335938	10.97998046875	309.5426330566406	16
In summer 1999, it could seem that Russia got an opportunity to benefit	144.59837341308594	529.780517578125	10.980010986328125	323.14793395996094	16
from the interest of the EU states in the success of their first foreign policy	127.61890411376953	542.4404296875	10.97998046875	340.01766204833984	16
project aimed at the transformation of Russia into a democratic European	127.61891174316406	555.100341796875	10.980010986328125	340.1780242919922	16
power, consistent with the common European rules. But soon after Vladimir	127.61891174316406	567.7603149414062	10.97998046875	340.18345642089844	16
Putin had come to power, Russia started resisting the EU attempts to conduct	127.61891174316406	580.35986328125	10.97998046875	340.36460876464844	16
common foreign policy towards Russia. First of all, Russia tried to take ad-	127.618896484375	593.019775390625	10.979995727539062	340.1076354980469	16
vantage of the contradictions within the EU. But soon the attempts to take	127.61888122558594	605.6797485351562	10.979995727539062	340.0780792236328	16
advantage of the contradictions and, especially, to oppose ‘old’ Europe to the	127.618896484375	618.3397216796875	10.979995727539062	340.30316162109375	16
new members of the EU proved to be counterproductive. It became evident	127.618896484375	630.9996337890625	10.979995727539062	340.1702880859375	16
in 2007, when, unexpectedly for the Russian diplomacy, Poland blocked the	127.618896484375	643.5991821289062	10.979995727539062	340.1252746582031	16
subscription of the new PCA planned at the EU-Russia summit in Samara,	127.618896484375	656.2591552734375	10.979995727539062	340.0417785644531	16
which Russia had been aiming at for five years. The leaders of the Union did	127.618896484375	668.9190673828125	10.979995727539062	340.0999755859375	16
not merely refrained from calling Poland to ‘order’, but at the summit itself	127.618896484375	681.5789794921875	10.979995727539062	340.2064514160156	16

It is important to mention, that one of the peculiarities of the EU is the	144.60000610351562	125.0250244140625	10.98004150390625	323.1644592285156	19
fact that this intergovernmental structure is still undergoing the process of	127.62053680419922	137.6849365234375	10.98004150390625	340.0593032836914	19
formation. It defines, to a great extent, the foreign policy strategies of the	127.62053680419922	150.3448486328125	10.98004150390625	340.09668731689453	19
Union, which are motivated more by attempts to create conditions for the	127.62052917480469	162.94439697265625	10.98004150390625	340.1736602783203	19
further accretion of the power to make the EU a real actor of foreign policy	127.62052917480469	175.60430908203125	10.98004150390625	340.0867156982422	19
than by the EU foreign policy interests. Thus member states should reject the	127.62052917480469	188.26422119140625	10.98004150390625	340.4853973388672	19
most significant part of their sovereignty which needs serious stimuli. Now,	127.62052917480469	200.92413330078125	10.98004150390625	340.14830017089844	19
economic cooperation in the framework of the EU has almost reached the	127.62052917480469	213.58404541015625	10.98004150390625	340.15708923339844	19
level of a federative union; and the Union represents the interests of all the	127.62051391601562	226.24395751953125	10.98004150390625	340.0989074707031	19
member states. In other spheres, first of all, in foreign policy, solidarity is	127.62051391601562	238.843505859375	10.98004150390625	340.25482177734375	19
limited: the principles of decision-making have an intergovernmental charac-	127.62049865722656	251.50341796875	10.98004150390625	340.23619079589844	19
ter, i.e. a decision is made only if the member states reached an accord. It	127.62049865722656	264.163330078125	10.98004150390625	340.0802459716797	19
means that the mechanism of formulating “common interests” in this sphere	127.62049865722656	276.8232421875	10.98004150390625	340.15818786621094	19
has not been elaborated yet; there is only a “common denominator” of dif-	127.6204833984375	289.483154296875	10.98004150390625	340.0703125	19
ferent interests.	127.6204833984375	302.08270263671875	10.98004150390625	67.80697631835938	19
The prerequisite — the EU has not formed a mechanism of formulating	144.59996032714844	314.74261474609375	10.98004150390625	323.1084747314453	19
common interests — sometimes brings Russian diplomats to the false con-	127.62049102783203	327.402587890625	10.97998046875	340.0934371948242	19
clusion that it is possible (and one should try) to take advantage of the con-	127.62049102783203	340.0625	10.980010986328125	340.1285629272461	19
tradictions between the EU member states. At the same time they do not take	127.62049865722656	352.72247314453125	10.97998046875	340.2010040283203	19
into account that for many European politicians the basic interest consists in	127.62049865722656	365.322021484375	10.97998046875	340.03517150878906	19
establishing common institutes (rules) of the EU foreign policy. Despite	127.6204833984375	377.98193359375	10.980010986328125	340.1504821777344	19
different positions on certain issues, there is a collective comprehension of	127.6204833984375	390.64190673828125	10.97998046875	340.1252746582031	19
the necessity to elaborate rules defining the future development of the EU	127.6204833984375	403.30181884765625	10.980010986328125	340.08355712890625	19

However, the increasing political tension between the EU and Russia can	144.59996032714844	428.6217041015625	10.980010986328125	323.21714782714844	19
be ‘compensated’ by cooperation at other institutional levels. So, political	127.62049102783203	441.22125244140625	10.980010986328125	340.0967025756836	19
frictions at the highest level can stimulate the participation of the Russian	127.62049865722656	453.8812255859375	10.97998046875	340.06813049316406	19
government in regional EU initiatives (such as the ND). At the same time, it	127.62049865722656	466.5411376953125	10.980010986328125	340.14939880371094	19
is crucial that, in order to succeed in this balancing between levels, the ND	127.62051391601562	479.20111083984375	10.97998046875	340.1054382324219	19
context should be separated from the problem field of the ‘high politics’. In	127.62051391601562	491.86102294921875	10.980010986328125	340.1461181640625	19
this case, cross-border and interregional programme(s) will be more efficient	127.62051391601562	504.4605407714844	10.980010986328125	340.1735534667969	19

It is possible to assume that if some actors choose the level of EU-Russia	144.59999084472656	593.019775390625	10.979995727539062	323.1534881591797	19

(regions) will follow different and, maybe, contradictory strategies towards	127.62049865722656	643.5991821289062	10.979995727539062	340.1669464111328	19

The development of the ND is a good example of how the tension in the	144.60000610351562	124.96502685546875	10.98004150390625	323.0975036621094	22

As Aalto shows [4], the ND was, first of all, an attempt to overcome the	144.60000610351562	254.86529541015625	10.98004150390625	323.13592529296875	24

From the very beginning, the ND was oriented towards partnership and	144.5989227294922	392.8082275390625	10.980010986328125	323.1490936279297	24

As Lannon and Elsuwege point out: “The fact that these partner countries	127.61944580078125	417.88873291015625	10.980010986328125	340.1230773925781	24

rather unusual in the EU context. In other words, the partner countries were	127.61944580078125	455.56878662109375	10.980010986328125	340.1109924316406	24

Browning and Joenniemi [5] agree that openness to external participants is	127.61944580078125	480.6492919921875	10.980010986328125	340.0846252441406	24
indeed a peculiar feature of the ND. For all member-states this involvement	127.61944580078125	493.1895751953125	10.97998046875	340.138427734375	24
into the initiative grants an opportunity and grounds for the discussion of	127.61946105957031	505.7298278808594	10.980010986328125	340.11976623535156	24

Later, Finland started to make efforts to transform the image of the ND	144.60003662109375	568.4310913085938	10.97998046875	323.1226806640625	24
— from a foreign policy to a cooperation project that equally belonged to the	127.62056732177734	580.9713134765625	10.980010986328125	340.4656448364258	24

fence policy. For an outside observer, the ND may seem a project, in the	127.62054443359375	618.5921020507812	10.979995727539062	340.1285400390625	24

relations with the rest of the world and Russia in particular. The ND can be	127.62052917480469	643.73193359375	10.979995727539062	340.1121368408203	24
also considered as a ‘Northern alternative’ to the eastern and southern vec-	127.62052917480469	656.2721557617188	10.979995727539062	340.1329803466797	24
tors of the EU development. As Trenin assumes [13] there is a possibility of	127.62054443359375	668.8123779296875	10.979995727539062	340.11865234375	24
forming a new common global identity — the ‘Northern’ one.	127.62054443359375	681.3526611328125	10.979995727539062	273.05169677734375	24
It was repeatedly emphasized that the ND proves the ability of small EU	144.6000213623047	693.9522094726562	10.979995727539062	323.0491485595703	24
powers to achieve much conducting ‘smart small policies’. If in the case of	127.61946105957031	706.6121826171875	10.980003356933594	340.13511657714844	24

Russia, it concerns the regions that actively participated in the ND activity	127.62000274658203	125.0250244140625	10.98004150390625	340.13838958740234	27
and success depended to a great extend on the interest and involvement of	127.62001037597656	137.6849365234375	10.98004150390625	340.18125915527344	27

It is not a coincidence that such initiatives and projects are implemented	144.5994873046875	162.8851318359375	10.98004150390625	323.1797790527344	27

oriented cooperation. The attempts to harmonise and realise such projects	127.6200180053711	188.02496337890625	10.98004150390625	340.14286041259766	27
among national governments inevitably lead to significant transaction costs.	127.6200180053711	200.56524658203125	10.98004150390625	340.29874420166016	27
On the contrary, interregional contacts allow keeping costs low; cooperation	127.6200180053711	213.10552978515625	10.98004150390625	340.13187408447266	27
is developing as a ‘general practice’ beyond the ‘high’ policy context.	127.62002563476562	225.64581298828125	10.98004150390625	307.77386474609375	27

combination creates a “special subsidiarity form” — the EU states formulate	127.61944580078125	471.94561767578125	10.980010986328125	340.0934753417969	30
and realise foreign policy in collaboration with external actors able to gener-	127.61944580078125	484.30584716796875	10.97998046875	340.1636657714844	30
ate necessary ‘power’ to solve certain problems [7, p. 390]. Such subsidiary	127.61944580078125	496.72528076171875	10.980010986328125	340.1197509765625	30
allows the EU to conduct its multilevel foreign policy. On the other hand, the	127.61944580078125	509.08551025390625	10.97998046875	340.18017578125	30
most concerned member states can avoid the contradictions of ‘high’ politics	127.61943054199219	521.5050048828125	10.980010986328125	340.1877899169922	30
focusing on those fields of cooperation where the participation of regional	127.61944580078125	533.8651733398438	10.97998046875	340.2119445800781	30
and subregional actors will lead to the creation of additional value (the	127.61944580078125	546.28466796875	10.980010986328125	340.2460021972656	30

The subsidiarity principle applied to the ND drastically differs from the	144.5989227294922	571.0050048828125	10.980010986328125	323.1852569580078	30
ideas of “two-speed Europe” and “Europe of regions”. Perhaps, it can be	127.61943054199219	583.4244995117188	10.979995727539062	340.15382385253906	30
easily explained by means of multilevel governance approach, which implies	127.61943054199219	595.78466796875	10.979995727539062	340.2251739501953	30
that the actors can influence the decision-making process in the EU by nu-	127.61943054199219	608.2041625976562	10.979995727539062	340.16587829589844	30
merous means — from collaborating with European institutions to indirect	127.61943054199219	620.5643310546875	10.979995727539062	340.1724395751953	30
actions through regional, national and subnational bodies. The policy thus	127.61943054199219	632.9838256835938	10.979995727539062	340.14173889160156	30
formed is a result of overlapping jurisdictions, tensions and conflicts in the	127.61943054199219	645.343994140625	10.979995727539062	340.16810607910156	30
multilevel governance system [10].	127.61943054199219	657.7042236328125	10.979995727539062	155.1704559326172	30
Applying this subsidiarity logic to the ND one can expect the process of	144.59890747070312	670.1236572265625	10.979995727539062	323.08648681640625	30

Let us mention, that the ND subsidiarity logic does not contradict (but	144.5994873046875	162.16497802734375	10.98004150390625	323.1885681152344	33

key actors will define their strategies in accordance with, firstly, the general	127.62001037597656	187.48480224609375	10.98004150390625	340.06703186035156	33
