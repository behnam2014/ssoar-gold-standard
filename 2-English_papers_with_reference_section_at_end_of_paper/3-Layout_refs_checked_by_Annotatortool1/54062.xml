The woman’s life…	453.94000244140625	42.53826904296875	11.0400390625	93.7833251953125	67
It is appropriate to note that in this study, it was very clear evidence of adaptive	126.13999938964844	258.55828857421875	11.0400390625	423.41688537597656	68
reactions. In the first analysis of categories can be observed negative reactions, which are	90.74400329589844	277.6383056640625	11.0400390625	458.94374084472656	68
directly related to the diagnosis of cancer, where evidence of a disease that threatens the	90.74400329589844	296.8682861328125	11.0400390625	459.04640197753906	68
lives leads many women to react negatively, in which Roy classifies as a "negative response	90.74400329589844	316.06829833984375	11.0400390625	458.85536193847656	68
to the stimulus." Cancer in women's view is a disease that is directly associated with death,	90.74400329589844	335.1483154296875	11.0400390625	458.7450714111328	68
become so frightening stage for these.	90.74400329589844	354.3482666015625	11.0400390625	190.8484344482422	68
We found disease recurrence reports with bone metastasis, thus we highlight the	126.13999938964844	373.54827880859375	11.0400390625	423.37306213378906	68
importance of performing diagnostic tests at intervals for those who have experienced the	90.74400329589844	392.6282958984375	11.0400390625	458.9879913330078	68
disease and out mastectomizado due to disease recurrence probabilities.	90.74400329589844	411.82830810546875	11.0400390625	361.2839813232422	68
The time of diagnosis of mastectomy is another point to be questioned, there are	130.6999969482422	431.02825927734375	11.0400390625	419.03273010253906	68
women who do not accept the principle surgery, trying to look for other solutions; some	90.74400329589844	450.1082763671875	11.0400390625	458.7007598876953	68
readily accept without question and others have neutral responses, because for these surgery	90.74400329589844	469.30828857421875	11.0400390625	459.15357971191406	68
is the possibility of cure while the mutilation of a body part, a feminine characteristics thus	90.74400329589844	488.50830078125	11.0400390625	458.9420928955078	68
disagree with the theory proposed by Roy, where we believe that a person can generate	90.74400329589844	507.6083068847656	11.040008544921875	458.94361877441406	68
neutral responses at the time of conflict between something that can be good and bad at the	90.74400329589844	526.808349609375	11.040008544921875	459.1110382080078	68
same time, so do not generate responses, either positively or negatively; even for a short	90.74400329589844	546.00830078125	11.040008544921875	458.8444366455078	68
period of time, occurring after a positive or negative response.	90.74400329589844	565.0882568359375	11.040008544921875	312.4099578857422	68
The physical limitation after mastectomy was widely discussed in the study, most of	126.13999938964844	584.288330078125	11.040008544921875	423.57142639160156	68
the women had some limitation of physical, the main problems were related to shoulder	90.74400329589844	603.48828125	11.040008544921875	458.8296661376953	68
movements; the impossibility of use of accessories, low-cut clothes and change in daily	90.74400329589844	622.568359375	11.040008544921875	459.1089630126953	68
routine. Roy in his studies believe that the adaptive process is continuous, which leads us to	90.74400329589844	641.768310546875	11.040008544921875	459.09620666503906	68
think that women can take years or even a lifetime, to adapt to the new reality.	90.74400329589844	660.96826171875	11.040008544921875	399.2505340576172	68
During the research there were reports of loss of self-esteem and a great difficulty	126.13999938964844	680.04833984375	11.040008544921875	423.74452209472656	68
dealing with the loss of the breast, according to Roy featuring a "negative response to the	90.74400329589844	699.2783203125	11.040008544921875	459.2132110595703	68
stimulus." Family and religiosity were reported during the survey, these are very important in	90.74400329589844	718.478271484375	11.040008544921875	459.0652618408203	68
the whole process favoring adaptive reactions; however, our research was to feature the	90.74400329589844	737.558349609375	11.040008544921875	458.88868713378906	68
evaluation of individual adaptive process, i.e., the representatively of cancer to the woman	90.74400329589844	756.7583618164062	11.039993286132812	459.1221466064453	68
and not the family processes.	90.74400329589844	775.8383178710938	11.039993286132812	145.72801208496094	68
Our research also aimed to ascertain the assistance of per operative nursing,	126.13999938964844	795.038330078125	11.039993286132812	423.61573791503906	68
comprising the period before, during and after surgery. The result found that there were	90.74400329589844	814.2383422851562	11.039993286132812	458.9988555908203	68
differences in the assessment of care provided by nursing professionals, case reports that	90.74400329589844	833.3182983398438	11.039993286132812	459.08851623535156	68
characterized the action of these as positive 50%, neglect of case reports 25% and 25%	90.74400329589844	852.5183715820312	11.039993286132812	458.7893829345703	68
reported changing the professional attitude over the years. From these results lead us to think	90.74400329589844	871.7183227539062	11.040000915527344	458.87733459472656	68
that nurses need to be trained better for their professional performance.	90.74400329589844	890.79833984375	11.040000915527344	362.51206970214844	68

responses by stimuli. We agree with Roy for believing that the person continuously adapts,	90.74400329589844	929.2183227539062	11.040000915527344	458.8444366455078	68

100% reported at the end positive response. Roy disagrees because we believe that there	90.74400329589844	124.3983154296875	11.0400390625	459.0513458251953	73

the activity of thinking can help the woman to accept the proposed therapy. As for nursing	90.74400329589844	181.8782958984375	11.0400390625	458.95887756347656	73
care in the preoperative period, the research identified the need for improvement and	90.74400329589844	201.07830810546875	11.0400390625	459.05409240722656	73
training for nurse’s work in surgical breast procedures, this being a facilitator of adaptive	90.74400329589844	220.15826416015625	11.0400390625	459.21949768066406	73

surgery, encompasses care to reverse an altered physiological function, maintaining their	90.74400329589844	277.6383056640625	11.0400390625	459.0210723876953	73
