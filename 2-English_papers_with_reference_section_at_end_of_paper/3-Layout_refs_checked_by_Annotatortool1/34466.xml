this global order. We used to say “what’s good for GM is good for America” (or at	113.40044403076172	200.486572265625	10.97998046875	368.5095901489258	53

the United States is one example; by contrast, inequality is tempered in Europe by	113.40043640136719	476.72802734375	10.97998046875	368.51512145996094	53

aimed at local, national and global conditions. Predominantly local, such coalitions,	113.40003967285156	464.3670349121094	10.97998046875	368.44264221191406	133

economic and social policy reform, an American movement with potentially global	113.40003967285156	489.0874328613281	10.97998046875	368.53822326660156	133

The argument presented here first contends that this revitalization of social forces	133.25955200195312	515.8468017578125	10.97998046875	348.6950378417969	133
in the U.S. is significant enough to need explanation, and, second, presents evidence	113.4000244140625	528.2069702148438	10.97998046875	368.51177978515625	133
pointing toward key causal forces at work: chronic inequality, strategic leadership, and	113.4000244140625	540.62646484375	10.97998046875	368.43829345703125	133
most importantly coalition building. Because inequality is increasingly highlighted in	113.4000244140625	552.9866333007812	10.97998046875	368.5469970703125	133

ments now offer strategic leadership with a greatly expanded perspective, and because	113.40110778808594	577.70703125	10.980010986328125	368.5359649658203	133
coalition building among these and other groups is rampant across a range of issues,	113.4000244140625	590.1265258789062	10.979995727539062	368.4898681640625	133
especially at the local level but increasingly at national and global levels as well, there is	113.4000244140625	602.4866943359375	10.979995727539062	368.47552490234375	133
reason to hope for the expansion of substantial ongoing reform efforts, right here in	113.4000244140625	614.8468627929688	10.979995727539062	368.45037841796875	133
