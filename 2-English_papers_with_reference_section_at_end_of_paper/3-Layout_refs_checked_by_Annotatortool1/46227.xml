to the host country ways of life. On the other hand teachers, employers, the police	113.40000915527344	607.689697265625	9.479995727539062	354.36903381347656	5
and media keep considering them as “different”. This tension is particularly sig-	113.40000915527344	618.66943359375	9.479995727539062	354.2987823486328	5

creativity in trying to help their children, boys and girls differently, to cope with	113.40000915527344	651.6693115234375	9.479995727539062	354.33204650878906	5

drives, and organizes all their courses of action. But in bringing up and educating	113.40000915527344	192.66925048828125	9.599609375	354.3329315185547	9

which we call subjective resources2. One of the ways they do that is by explaining	113.4000244140625	236.64886474609375	9.599609375	354.3504638671875	9

country of origin and have come to the host country they live in. Indeed the key	113.40032958984375	258.6697998046875	9.47998046875	354.48748779296875	9
element of this process of transmission from generation to generation is through	113.40032958984375	269.6495361328125	9.47998046875	354.4078063964844	9
the telling of family histories. As Robert Neuburger suggests, “Passing down suc-	113.40032958984375	280.68994140625	9.47998046875	354.45526123046875	9
cessfully amounts to passing down the ability to pass down” (Neuburger 1997, p.	113.40032958984375	291.669677734375	9.599609375	354.31884765625	9

formation about the past and tradition, but also about the need for change. And	113.40031433105469	313.6898193359375	9.47998046875	354.40013122558594	9
the power of these stories, as Toshiaki Kozakaï remarks, rests not on biological	113.40031433105469	324.6695556640625	9.47998046875	354.45237731933594	9

shaped by a twofold series of humiliating experiences. First, and common to eve-	113.40126037597656	379.6895751953125	9.47998046875	354.3633575439453	9

grated, is the experience of having occupied the lowest posts in society. Second,	113.40126037597656	401.6490478515625	9.47998046875	354.40028381347656	9
and specific to immigrants, is the racism that they have experienced. Immigrant	113.40126037597656	412.689453125	9.47998046875	354.36705017089844	9
parents have often difficult family histories in relation to colonisation, wars…	113.40126037597656	423.669189453125	9.47998046875	354.3842315673828	9
They are sometimes prone to silence when it comes to admitting what they have	113.40032958984375	434.64892578125	9.47998046875	354.31390380859375	9
been through. But this silence is also a collective phenomenon in which the media	113.40032958984375	445.6893310546875	9.47998046875	354.343505859375	9
play a large part. Indeed for example the media continue ignoring the history of	113.40032958984375	456.6690673828125	9.47998046875	354.2146911621094	9

hancing the history of the French peasantry as part of national identity.	113.40032958984375	478.689208984375	9.47998046875	309.124755859375	9

play a crucial role in socialising migrant children. As Jean Piaget explains in his	113.39937591552734	533.6485595703125	9.47998046875	354.4817886352539	9

one cannot neglect the role of the child her or himself as an active participant in	113.39937591552734	555.668701171875	9.47998046875	354.2382583618164	9

Socialisation cannot be reduced to schooling; it is an implicit impregnation. The	124.73934936523438	588.6685791015625	9.479995727539062	343.10009765625	9

(country of origin). The success (or failure) of this process also depends on how	113.39938354492188	621.66845703125	9.479995727539062	354.3558654785156	9

to be more developed than in France. The sense of belonging of migrant children	113.40000915527344	236.64886474609375	9.47998046875	354.23448181152344	12
and their national affiliation depends on the dialogue between migrant parents	113.40000915527344	247.68927001953125	9.47998046875	354.2222137451172	12

both the life course of the interviewee and the way he or she made links between	113.39996337890625	445.68853759765625	9.47998046875	354.321533203125	12

To study the evolution of feelings of national affiliation of immigrants and their	113.4000015258789	220.68963623046875	9.47998046875	354.3197250366211	19

views in different fieldwork contexts. As Daniel Bertaux argues, the biographical	113.4000015258789	242.64910888671875	9.47998046875	354.40319061279297	19

cal reality from an ethno-sociological perspective [...] focusing on the patterns of	113.4000015258789	264.66925048828125	9.47998046875	354.3890609741211	19

identifying the specific configuration of these dimensions requires a study of this	113.39974975585938	297.6697998046875	9.47998046875	354.4865417480469	19

stories collected deal with both practices, beliefs and representations, which are	113.39973449707031	319.68994140625	9.47998046875	354.45057678222656	19

make connections between them. The objective is to encourage the narration of	113.39973449707031	341.6494140625	9.47998046875	354.3765106201172	19

representations that social actors develop about those facts. The challenge is to	113.39973449707031	363.6695556640625	9.47998046875	354.3413848876953	19

The family members are as “significant others”, in the words of George Herbert	113.39968872070312	484.6900634765625	9.47998046875	354.38629150390625	19

and their members, it was essential for us to hear their own intimate accounts of	113.39967346191406	539.6494140625	9.47998046875	354.3633270263672	19

desire of these people to share their life story. It was then important to explain that	113.39967346191406	572.6492919921875	9.47998046875	354.3956756591797	19

so collect different information, which allows us to situate the family history in a	113.4000015258789	181.68951416015625	9.47998046875	354.3679428100586	22

Before highlighting the richness of data collected through this methodology, we	124.74091339111328	247.68927001953125	9.47998046875	343.01766204833984	22

As Ursula Apitzsch stated in our Franco-German seminar, ethnicity or rather	113.4000015258789	330.6696472167969	9.480010986328125	354.37569427490234	24

ty and self-claimed identity. She spoke of the difficult dialectic between both eth-	113.39999389648438	352.6897888183594	9.480010986328125	354.2977600097656	24
nicity as a form of often-unwelcome attribution by others and ethnicity as a form	113.39999389648438	363.6695251464844	9.480010986328125	354.4162902832031	24
of a conscious self-definition of individuals within the social context of a communi-	113.39997863769531	374.6492614746094	9.480010986328125	354.24095153808594	24
ty. She added that, paradoxically, the second process produces the tendency of	113.39999389648438	385.6896667480469	9.480010986328125	354.43341064453125	24
transforming ethnic belonging into an inheritable social position. But how to	113.39999389648438	396.6694030761719	9.480010986328125	354.40802001953125	24
study this “transformation” while the claim of an ethnic identity seen as “other” in	113.39999389648438	407.6491394042969	9.480010986328125	354.35125732421875	24
European societies, is often devalued and causes “social sanctions” as for instance	113.39999389648438	418.6895446777344	9.480010986328125	354.34820556640625	24
difficulty to find a job?	113.39999389648438	429.6692810058594	9.480010986328125	95.87223815917969	24
Indeed, immigrant families in France and Germany face a major discredit be-	124.7399673461914	440.6490173339844	9.480010986328125	342.8535690307617	24
cause of their geographical origin and their cultural practices. They carry “discred-	113.39999389648438	451.6894226074219	9.480010986328125	354.4183349609375	24
iting differences” which have a double effect: their visibility in the public sphere is	113.39997863769531	462.6691589355469	9.480010986328125	354.4280548095703	24
subject to negative stereotypes or they are confined to invisibility. In both cases,	113.39997863769531	473.6488952636719	9.480010986328125	354.55577087402344	24
their existence is not recognised, or is only recognised with difficulty. This discredit	113.39997863769531	484.6893005371094	9.480010986328125	354.47523498535156	24
tends to make it more complex to know the actions of immigrants and their chil-	113.39997863769531	495.6690368652344	9.480010986328125	354.34812927246094	24
dren, their plans, and their discourses, as soon as they seem to move away from the	113.39999389648438	506.6487731933594	9.480010986328125	354.3727111816406	24
model to which they are expected to comply: a well “integrated” worker.	113.39999389648438	517.689208984375	9.480010986328125	303.5495910644531	24
This phenomenon is particularly strong in France, because of its republican	124.73995971679688	528.6689453125	9.480010986328125	343.11810302734375	24
model that de-legitimises foreign origin and all practices and claims for recognition	113.39997863769531	539.648681640625	9.480010986328125	354.4506072998047	24
(Honneth 1992/2000). The discrediting discourse derives partly from the experience	113.39997863769531	550.6890869140625	9.480010986328125	354.44773864746094	24
of colonisation that initially shaped the representations of colonised people that still	113.40092468261719	561.6688232421875	9.71063232421875	354.41749572753906	24
weigh on their descendants. This is particularly true for Muslims. A good example	113.40092468261719	572.6485595703125	9.480010986328125	354.50733947753906	24
of this would be the experience of Algerians who were offered French nationality	113.40092468261719	583.68896484375	9.479995727539062	354.3245391845703	24
only if they agreed to renounce Islam (Décret Crémieux 1870; Delcroix 2009).	113.40092468261719	594.668701171875	9.479995727539062	327.2809295654297	24
This public and political discourse has a very tangible impact on the attitudes	124.74089813232422	605.6484375	9.479995727539062	343.05274200439453	24
and discourses of migrants and their descendants. As a reaction, they tend to	113.40092468261719	616.6888427734375	9.479995727539062	354.31407165527344	24
erase what is perceived in the host country as unacceptable differences in some	113.40092468261719	627.6685791015625	9.479995727539062	354.34901428222656	24
everyday practises. In the way they present themselves, some seem to deliberately	113.40092468261719	638.6483154296875	9.479995727539062	354.24656677246094	24
forget their foreign origin, or underestimate its importance. It was only after	113.40092468261719	649.688720703125	9.479995727539062	354.3775177001953	24
spending time with them that they began talking openly with us about it. Others,	113.40090942382812	660.66845703125	9.479995727539062	354.2694091796875	24
however, respond by “turning the stigma”, as Erving Goffman said, claiming their	113.40090942382812	671.648193359375	9.479995727539062	354.3841552734375	24
identity in a positive way, as for example when Muslim women decide to wear the	113.4009017944336	682.6885986328125	9.479995727539062	354.2514419555664	24

veil, this practice being sometimes associated with an explicitly political discourse.	113.4000015258789	148.68963623046875	9.47998046875	354.41832733154297	27
In all cases, they have to deal with multiple identities, some of which are more or	113.39999389648438	159.66937255859375	9.47998046875	354.29107666015625	27
less stigmatizing (Lagier 2011).	113.39999389648438	170.64910888671875	9.47998046875	135.10890197753906	27
In addition from the point of view of the host countries, the history of migrants	124.7399673461914	181.68951416015625	9.47998046875	343.0339584350586	27
often begins from when they crossed the border to settle here. However, before	113.39999389648438	192.66925048828125	9.47998046875	354.31890869140625	27
migrating, these individuals are first emigrants who left their country of origin, as	113.39999389648438	203.64898681640625	9.47998046875	354.3235778808594	27
recalled by Abdelmalek Sayad (1999). But everything regarding their past is	113.39999389648438	214.68939208984375	9.47998046875	354.312255859375	27
largely undervalued and is not considered by the institutions of the host countries	113.39999389648438	225.66912841796875	9.47998046875	354.3983459472656	27
as a worthy story to be told. Thus, unlike the French and German families in their	113.39999389648438	236.64886474609375	9.47998046875	354.307373046875	27
respective countries, migrant families are isolated to pass on their history and	113.39999389648438	247.68927001953125	9.47998046875	354.2810363769531	27

couraged from doing so on behalf of the idea that integration requires forgetting	113.39999389648438	280.68914794921875	9.47998046875	354.3614196777344	27

Let us now see some examples, case studies, illustrating the efficiency of the	113.4000015258789	471.6696472167969	9.480010986328125	354.37755584716797	29

the eyes of most members of the family are turned towards Africa, to Ghana and	113.39958190917969	335.6492919921875	9.47998046875	354.4449005126953	34

aware of the history of his father and the danger he faced. Migration is presented	113.39959716796875	390.6697998046875	9.47998046875	354.30828857421875	34
as constrained to the political context. But, more broadly, the way parents have	113.39959716796875	401.6495361328125	9.47998046875	354.3358459472656	34
explained this trajectory and the way children have understood it as a “tearing”	113.39959716796875	412.68994140625	9.599609375	354.4391784667969	34
(Kofi), may result from the fact their migration meant a significant social down-	113.39956665039062	423.669677734375	9.47998046875	354.3451843261719	34
grading for the family. The father and mother belong to the upper classes of their	113.39956665039062	434.6494140625	9.47998046875	354.4751281738281	34
respective countries of origin. Their families are large landowners. Leon had a	113.39956665039062	445.6898193359375	9.47998046875	354.35955810546875	34
large transport company before being forced to emigrate. On arriving in France he	113.39956665039062	456.6695556640625	9.47998046875	354.3443908691406	34

This “forced” and painful migration trajectory, leading to significant social	124.73954010009766	478.689697265625	9.47998046875	342.94847869873047	34
downgrading, may explain the difficulty in developing a positive affiliation to the	113.39956665039062	489.66943359375	9.47998046875	354.3128967285156	34

Ghana. But for the father, Leon, and for his son, Kofi – we both interviewed them	113.39956665039062	511.6895751953125	9.47998046875	354.3282775878906	34
extensively – ambitions are not the same. Leon wants to go to Togo to participate	113.39956665039062	522.6693115234375	9.47998046875	354.3717956542969	34
in the political life of his country. Kofi also wants to return but to carry on its	113.39956665039062	533.6490478515625	9.47998046875	354.2060546875	34
“pan-African political struggle” beyond the Togolese context. If the father defines	113.39956665039062	544.689453125	9.47998046875	354.298828125	34

cal political involvement of Kofi can be understood as a reaction to the discredit	113.39956665039062	566.64892578125	9.47998046875	354.2912292480469	34
and racism experienced in France. But for both, the migration history path, its	113.39956665039062	577.6893310546875	9.479995727539062	354.38604736328125	34
consequences and its understanding by each of them, could have encouraged the	113.39956665039062	588.6690673828125	9.479995727539062	354.4571533203125	34
fact that they define themselves by a single affiliation, national origin for the fa-	113.39956665039062	599.6488037109375	9.599624633789062	354.3624572753906	34
ther and “racial” identity for the son.	113.39958190917969	610.689208984375	9.479995727539062	157.8163604736328	34
In the Roinamze family, between Leon and Kofi in particular, what has been	124.73955535888672	621.6689453125	9.479995727539062	343.0888137817383	34
passed on is not only a relation to the country of origin or to the host country; it is	113.39958190917969	632.648681640625	9.479995727539062	354.3141632080078	34
also a relation to political commitment. The importance of politics comes from its	113.39958190917969	643.6890869140625	9.599624633789062	354.38404846191406	34
place in the family history before migration, its essential role as a motivation to	113.39958190917969	654.6688232421875	9.479995727539062	354.3832244873047	34
migrate, and from the fact that the father is very involved. Thus, if Kofi explains	113.39862060546875	665.6485595703125	9.479995727539062	354.340576171875	34
his involvement in radical pan-Africanism from the racism he has been victim of	113.39862060546875	676.68896484375	9.479995727539062	354.2505798339844	34
as a Black in France, it can also be understood as a form of affiliation to the line-	113.39862060546875	687.668701171875	9.479995727539062	354.24853515625	34

so have much in common: both are “oriented” towards the country or region of	113.4000015258789	159.66937255859375	9.47998046875	354.3007125854492	37
origin, and both generate intense activities and identifications. About this, Leon	113.40000915527344	170.64910888671875	9.47998046875	354.34242248535156	37
said “I even think that’s what keeps me alive”. And we find the same idea when Ko-	113.40000915527344	181.68951416015625	9.599609375	354.3311004638672	37
fi told us “My political struggle is the struggle of my life”.	113.3990478515625	192.66925048828125	9.599609375	241.61868286132812	37
In the end, the intense political involvement certainly strengthens the tendency	124.73902893066406	203.64898681640625	9.47998046875	342.8831329345703	37
to affiliate to one nation or one origin for the defence of which they feel they must	113.39905548095703	214.68939208984375	9.47998046875	354.34630584716797	37

and one son, who is the last child. He came to France with the project of getting	113.4000015258789	533.6491088867188	9.47998046875	354.3519515991211	53

She also took much interest in how her father was driving his truck: changing	113.4000015258789	170.64910888671875	9.47998046875	354.2884750366211	57

and get my licence”. Now, at 18 years-old, she knows exactly what she wants to	113.39999389648438	203.64898681640625	9.599609375	354.3007507324219	57

which is, in fact, their own pre-history. It was clear from what the two daughters	113.39997863769531	324.66876220703125	9.47998046875	354.3995819091797	57

Wahid Benarma, the father, came as a young man to France in the late 1960s; he	113.4000015258789	564.669677734375	9.480010986328125	354.33580780029297	59

to their children by mobilising their past personal experiences. They explained	113.4000015258789	159.66937255859375	9.47998046875	354.3586959838867	62
that they did not have the opportunity to study in Algeria, and encouraged them	113.4000015258789	170.64910888671875	9.47998046875	354.4162826538086	62
to take advantage of the opportunity they have to be born in France and be able to	113.4000015258789	181.68951416015625	9.47998046875	354.27706146240234	62
get a proper education. Wahid even said: “If I had been to school, I would have had	113.40000915527344	192.66925048828125	9.599609375	354.5263214111328	62

After a Master degree in International Business, Karim became manager in a	124.73902893066406	214.68939208984375	9.47998046875	342.9683380126953	62

plained the origins of his ambition:	113.39905548095703	247.68927001953125	9.47998046875	149.8749008178711	62
“My personal motivation is my parents … That’s what made me want to go ahead, seeing	113.4000015258789	264.5941162109375	8.51995849609375	354.3229293823242	63

whereas they gave me the chance to have a roof, good health, an education, something	113.39999389648438	284.57440185546875	8.51995849609375	354.32891845703125	63

The sacrifice of his parents that he refers to is twofold: on the one hand their mi-	113.4000015258789	310.68963623046875	9.47998046875	354.31493377685547	64

in order to finance their children’s studies.	113.4000244140625	332.64910888671875	9.47998046875	182.15823364257812	64
Indeed, Djamila’s choice to work while Wahid could no longer do so is directly	124.73999786376953	343.68951416015625	9.47998046875	343.0014877319336	64

ents is well understood by their children who contribute, by their own success, to	113.40003967285156	387.66912841796875	9.47998046875	354.37477111816406	64
the success of the whole family project to improve living conditions. Zineb told us	113.40003967285156	398.64886474609375	9.47998046875	354.37644958496094	64
about the trajectory of her family: “It’s true that we started a little at the bottom of	113.40003967285156	409.68927001953125	9.599609375	354.36146545410156	64
the ladder because my parents came from Algeria, immigrant parents, we started	113.40005493164062	420.7886047363281	9.480010986328125	354.4041442871094	64
from nothing and then gradually it rose through the ranks”.	113.40005493164062	431.7683410644531	9.480010986328125	254.7655029296875	64
But the Benarma family project is not merely about social success passed on	124.74002838134766	442.68914794921875	9.47998046875	342.93614959716797	64
between generations. It is also about attachment to different national affiliations	113.40003967285156	453.66888427734375	9.47998046875	354.28077697753906	64
considered as necessarily multiple. The choices of school and professional trajecto-	113.40003967285156	464.64862060546875	9.47998046875	354.36341857910156	64
ries of the children show a real attraction for foreign countries, particularly those	113.40003967285156	475.68902587890625	9.47998046875	354.39552307128906	64
overseas. This cosmopolitism is a consequence of a conscious educational strategy	113.40003967285156	486.66876220703125	9.47998046875	354.3035430908203	64
of their parents: the Benarma parents tell their story to Zineb and Karim and give	113.40003967285156	497.64849853515625	9.47998046875	354.26841735839844	64
them very positive descriptions of their country of origin, Algeria, where they go	113.40003967285156	508.68890380859375	9.47998046875	354.3595428466797	64
on holiday, as well as of their home country, France, where they travel often to-	113.40003967285156	519.6686401367188	9.47998046875	354.35292053222656	64
gether as a family. Wahid said for instance, that France is a country that has giv-	113.40005493164062	530.6483764648438	9.47998046875	354.420166015625	64
en him a “second education”, which made him know his rights as a human being.	113.40005493164062	541.6887817382812	9.599578857421875	354.3708190917969	64
Djamila said that the first day after her arrival in France, she already felt “at	113.4000473022461	552.6685180664062	9.599578857421875	354.27518463134766	64

geria. Wahid said about independence: “We went through hell”. But the colonial	113.40006256103516	574.6886596679688	9.599578857421875	354.33776092529297	64

“good image” of this country. The father explains that France is not responsible	113.40003967285156	596.6481323242188	9.599624633789062	354.4392852783203	64
for colonialism but accuses Europeans in general and Spain in particular.	113.40003967285156	607.6885375976562	9.479995727539062	315.3303680419922	64
In return, the children feel that it is “a chance to be in France”, even if it is not	124.7400131225586	618.6682739257812	9.479995727539062	343.08765411376953	64
“la vie en rose” as Karim says. At the same time both are very closely linked to	113.40003967285156	629.6480102539062	9.599624633789062	354.4429473876953	64
their parents’ country of origin. Before getting a job offer in Dubai – where he has	113.40003967285156	640.6884155273438	9.479995727539062	354.4202117919922	64

Both present themselves as “citizens of the world”, with special bonds to France	113.40003967285156	673.6882934570312	9.599624633789062	354.5302276611328	64

As their life courses go, the Benarma parents have had to make compromises	124.73999786376953	148.68963623046875	9.47998046875	343.05931854248047	67

To conclude, the reconstruction of family histories gives very good access to the	113.4000015258789	399.6696472167969	9.480010986328125	354.36144256591797	69

meaning to the current situation. This methodology helps us to avoid reification of	113.4000244140625	487.6895446777344	9.480010986328125	354.36431884765625	69

In general, the biographical approach and the use of narrative as a method of in-	113.4000244140625	537.6699829101562	9.47998046875	354.2684326171875	71
quiry encourage individuals to place their experiences in time, to refer to their	113.4000244140625	548.6497192382812	9.47998046875	354.28765869140625	71
past, and help locate the “turning points” in their life courses. Furthermore,	113.4000244140625	559.6901245117188	9.47998046875	354.3367614746094	71
through crossed interviews within a family, we have access to the planned action	113.40003967285156	570.6698608398438	9.47998046875	354.3461456298828	71
over several generations. This avoids any temptation to reify representations and	113.40003967285156	581.6495971679688	9.479995727539062	354.3480987548828	71

for instance, it is not a question of studying identity but of studying identifications	113.40003967285156	603.6697387695312	9.479995727539062	354.2230682373047	71
in their plurality and their evolutions. We thus obtain data on the development of	113.40003967285156	614.6494750976562	9.479995727539062	354.2487335205078	71

Moreover, we have information on what is passed on or not, in the private	124.73997497558594	203.64898681640625	9.47998046875	342.96742248535156	76
