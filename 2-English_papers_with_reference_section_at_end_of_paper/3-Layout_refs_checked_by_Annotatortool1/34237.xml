Abstract: The last decades have seen a deepening of paradiplomacy which is an especially	85.0000991821289	298.18267822265625	10.1048583984375	425.11510467529297	5
important phenomenon for the federal states. This development became a source of change in	85.0000991821289	309.70269775390625	9.84002685546875	425.0889205932617	5
the constitutions of federal states in order to trace prospects and limits for such process. Brazil	85.0000991821289	321.22271728515625	9.84002685546875	425.15917205810547	5

for its centralization like Brazil such discussion can be harsh but its relevance to local and	85.0000991821289	355.78271484375	9.839996337890625	425.1461715698242	5

Introduction	85.0000991821289	133.9130859375	12.0	69.98400115966797	26
Recent years have seen a deepening of studies on the international action of the so-	85.0000991821289	161.61712646484375	10.79998779296875	425.13329315185547	27
called sub-national1 governments. It is an especially important phenomenon for federal	85.0000991821289	174.3594970703125	12.9376220703125	425.1751937866211	27
states, since existing democratic regimes and federalism as a form of the state are	85.0000991821289	191.61712646484375	10.79998779296875	425.10729217529297	27
considered relevant internal factors for the development of international relations of	85.0000991821289	206.49713134765625	10.79998779296875	425.0880661010742	27
subnational governments (Vigevani 2006). Therefore, although it is not a phenomenon	85.0000991821289	221.61712646484375	10.79998779296875	425.09627532958984	27
unique to federal states, the international insertion of non-central government has	85.0000991821289	236.49713134765625	10.79998779296875	425.0952682495117	27
developed with some frequency and success in this form of state which makes this a	85.0000991821289	251.61712646484375	10.79998779296875	425.08446502685547	27
relevant theme for the understanding of the contemporary contours of federalism.	85.0000991821289	266.49713134765625	10.79998779296875	395.0844039916992	27
This development has meant that some federations have adapted their legislation	102.55020141601562	281.61712646484375	10.79998779296875	407.56402587890625	27
to draw up the perspectives and limits of the international action of sub-national	85.0000991821289	296.49713134765625	10.79998779296875	425.15352630615234	27
governments. Brazil is part of a group of states where non-central governments,	85.0000991821289	311.61712646484375	10.79998779296875	425.14620208740234	27
reaching beyond the national borders, have formed without a legal framework dictating	85.0000991821289	326.49713134765625	10.79998779296875	425.08568572998047	27
the process. This article seeks to understand how Brazilian national legal regulations	85.0000991821289	341.6171569824219	10.79998779296875	425.0602035522461	27
have dealt with this phenomenon and how the process of legal framing of	85.0000991821289	356.49713134765625	10.79998779296875	425.1412887573242	27
paradiplomacy is developing to meet the challenges this trend engenders.	85.0000991821289	371.6171569824219	10.79998779296875	358.9126205444336	27
Initially, I analyze the actions of sub-national governments in international	102.55020141601562	386.49713134765625	10.79998779296875	407.618408203125	27
development, concentrating specifically on the causes themselves and their growth.	85.0000991821289	401.6171569824219	10.79998779296875	425.14620208740234	27
Then the tendencies of the constitutionalization of the international relations	85.0000991821289	416.49713134765625	10.79998779296875	425.1742477416992	27
undertaken by sub-national governments will be examined, before moving on to review	85.0000991821289	431.6171569824219	10.79998779296875	425.05748748779297	27
the efforts to make it part of the law system in Brazil. Finally, I review the	85.0000991821289	446.49713134765625	10.79998779296875	425.0898666381836	27
consequences of un-constitutionalized paradiplomacy.	85.0000991821289	461.6171569824219	10.79998779296875	264.11812591552734	27
1. The Development of Paradiplomacy	106.20010375976562	494.27508544921875	10.79998779296875	188.96768188476562	28
Paradiplomacy refers to international action by non-central governments2 (Soldatos	85.0000991821289	519.4794921875	12.9376220703125	425.0892868041992	29
1990).3 Widespread international action of federal entities began before the 1970s and	85.0000991821289	534.3594970703125	12.9376220703125	425.0870895385742	29
1980s. Explanations for this development range from factors internal to federations	85.0000991821289	551.6171264648438	10.79998779296875	425.10128021240234	29
through to aspects acquired by the international system in recent decades (Keating	85.0000991821289	566.4971313476562	10.79998779296875	425.10570526123047	29
1999, Romero 2004).	85.0000991821289	581.6171264648438	10.800003051757812	103.92578887939453	29
Within federal states the drivers of paradiplomacy often include the division of	107.70010375976562	596.4971313476562	10.800003051757812	402.4410705566406	29
competencies and autonomy given to sub-units through federative pacts. The need for	85.0000991821289	611.6171264648438	10.800003051757812	425.1760787963867	29
members of the federation to fulfill competencies laid out by Constitutional charters	85.0000991821289	626.4971313476562	10.800003051757812	425.10338592529297	29

Academically, it would be correct to use the term “sub-state governments”, given the	99.2000732421875	654.1027221679688	9.840011596679688	410.89312744140625	33
distinction between State and Nation. However, due to the fact that it is generally accepted in	99.2000732421875	665.3826904296875	9.840011596679688	410.8794250488281	33
literature, the expression “sub-national governments” will be used in this paper. In the same	99.2000732421875	676.9027099609375	9.840011596679688	410.9363098144531	33
way, the term “non-central governments” will be used to refer to these entities, in contrast to	99.2000732421875	688.4226684570312	9.840011596679688	410.90350341796875	33

The term “non-central government” should be understood in a broad way, meaning a	99.2000732421875	711.7026977539062	9.840003967285156	410.9223327636719	33

began to be seen as an important instrument for the improvement of sub-national	85.0000991821289	162.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.15352630615234	36
public policies. This movement is facilitated, in the case of federations, because of	85.0000991821289	177.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.1496810913086	36
greater autonomy granted by central governments; unlike what has been seen to occur	85.0000991821289	192.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.10973358154297	36

paradiplomacy. The beginning of international action by non-central governments took	85.0000991821289	237.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.1119918823242	36
place in the larger context of the democratization of the international system; a process	85.0000991821289	252.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.21019744873047	36
that began after the Second World War (Sassen 2001.) Therefore an important change	85.0000991821289	267.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.0865707397461	36
occurred in the once exclusively inter-state system which had dominated the	85.0000991821289	282.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0887985229492	36
international arena since the 17th century. Although states remain the primary actors in	85.0000991821289	295.79949951171875	12.9376220703125	425.0872116088867	36
this scenario, the acceleration of international flows – or globalization – and the	85.0000991821289	312.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0875778198242	36
development of regional integration processes have facilitated the emergence of	85.0000991821289	327.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.16259002685547	36

for the increased action of sub-national governments in the foreign sphere. Waves of	85.0000991821289	372.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.13716888427734	36
migration for example, bring about the need for non-central governments to deal with	85.0000991821289	387.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.07555389404297	36

institutions and governments. Furthermore, the expansion of multinational corporations	85.0000991821289	417.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.15026092529297	36
has meant that sub-national governments need to develop policies focused on	85.0000991821289	432.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.11238861083984	36
economic internationalization, preparing their population and territory for the arrival of	85.0000991821289	447.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.2336654663086	36

The changes accompany a corresponding change in the approach of international	107.70010375976562	477.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	402.401611328125	36
problem solving; moving from a state-centric approach to one welcoming input from	85.0000991821289	492.817138671875	10.79998779296875	424.9916000366211	36
constituent units. The perception that regional and local level governments must be	85.0000991821289	507.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.0909957885742	36
included in problem-solving efforts related to these issues led to a greater	85.0000991821289	522.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.18285369873047	36

There is a tendency for paradiplomacy to supplement the activities of non-central	107.70010375976562	552.817138671875	10.79998779296875	402.45404052734375	36

national frontiers. In extremely rare cases, the international relations of sub-national	85.0000991821289	582.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.15352630615234	36

Therefore, during the 1990s, the United Nations held large conferences which were drivers	99.2000732421875	642.5827026367188	9.840011596679688	410.8362731933594	39
for sub-national governments, and, above all, the local powers were able to establish	99.2000732421875	653.8627319335938	9.840011596679688	410.9583740234375	39
themselves on the international scene (Rodrigues 2004, p. 441). Along the same line, in	99.2000732421875	665.3826904296875	9.840011596679688	410.9103088378906	39

important programs currently run by the institution. Through this, the UN has sought to	99.2000732421875	688.4226684570312	9.840011596679688	410.847412109375	39
involve regional and local governments, understanding that the solution for the big problems	99.2000732421875	699.9426879882812	9.840011596679688	410.9322204589844	39

This kind of foreign relations by sub-national governments is called protodiplomacy and has	99.2000732421875	723.2227783203125	9.839996337890625	410.921875	39
been more widely studied in the autonomous regions of Spain (Segura 2004).	99.2000732421875	734.502685546875	9.839996337890625	342.9649658203125	39

In Brazil paradiplomacy started to move forward more firmly in the 1980s, with the	107.70010375976562	117.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	402.38726806640625	42
redemocratization of the country after years of military dictatorship.6 A symbol of the	85.0000991821289	130.67950439453125	12.9376220703125	425.0822982788086	42
new democratic phase, the federal constitution of 1988 formally entrenched the right of	85.0000991821289	147.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.2199020385742	42
common citizens to participate in the democratic process. The constitution incorporated	85.0000991821289	162.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0130844116211	42
both the relevance of consensus and the need for the participation of minorities.	85.0000991821289	177.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.15782928466797	42
However the constitution also brought considerable administrative and political	85.0000991821289	192.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.1120834350586	42
decentralization through greater tax distribution and an extension of the sharing of	85.0000991821289	207.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.14672088623047	42
competences between federal entities. There is a greater autonomy of member states	85.0000991821289	222.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0621566772461	42
and,7 since they gained greater autonomy over the budgets, a larger number of	85.0000991821289	235.79949951171875	12.9376220703125	425.15755462646484	42

During the 1980s, following the paths of the world economy and the crisis of the	107.70010375976562	267.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	402.4426574707031	42
development-state based ideology of the 1970s; the Brazilian economy went through	85.0000991821289	282.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.08824920654297	42
an important period of adjustments. Brazil joined the new wave of economic liberalism	85.0000991821289	297.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.0255661010742	42
that affected most of the Western world. As part of the adaptation to this new context,	85.0000991821289	312.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.1496810913086	42
the federal government started an intensified process of economic deregulation, the	85.0000991821289	327.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.0866928100586	42
privatization of public corporations and opening to foreign capital. In practice, this	85.0000991821289	342.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.1030807495117	42
meant a reduction of the nation state in domestic affairs and a greater opening to the	85.0000991821289	357.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.1831588745117	42
international market.	85.0000991821289	372.817138671875	10.79998779296875	99.61229705810547	42
During the transition to economic liberalism, a reduction in the economic and	107.70010375976562	387.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	402.3880615234375	42
financial actions of the central government created a vacuum. This vacuum was then	85.0000991821289	402.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0929489135742	42
filled by the sub-national entities and municipalities of Brazil. The seizing of	85.0000991821289	417.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.18419647216797	42
opportunities provided by foreign investment appeared as an appealing alternative to	85.0000991821289	432.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.08028411865234	42
other options that were advanced to deal with the issues which were arising (Barreto	85.0000991821289	447.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.08309173583984	42

There is some consensus in the literature about what promotes international	107.70010375976562	507.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	402.44464111328125	42
organizations to seek constituent level input in federations. Michael Keating was one of	85.0000991821289	522.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.2343063354492	42
the first scholars to define three general groups of such motivations that fit the Brazilian	85.0000991821289	537.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.1013717651367	42
situation, these causes are economic, political and cultural (Keating 2004). In the	85.0000991821289	552.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.09947967529297	42
economic sphere, it is sought after international funding, as well as foreign investments	85.0000991821289	567.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.14476776123047	42
and increased exports of locally produced goods. In the political sphere, agreements	85.0000991821289	582.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.1582565307617	42

periods, but the country still has a strongly centralized structure.	99.2000732421875	734.502685546875	9.839996337890625	282.3253479003906	43

are made to empower local public policies and disseminate best practices as well as	85.0000991821289	117.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.10558319091797	46
carry the needs of sub-national governments to the international system – through	85.0000991821289	132.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0656051635742	46
networks of cities and bilateral agreements, for example. In the cultural sphere, sub-	85.0000991821289	147.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.13329315185547	46
national governments seek agreements that deal with migratory flows and which allow	85.0000991821289	162.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.02108001708984	46
greater visibility to increase tourism.	85.0000991821289	177.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	174.79802703857422	46
Therefore, it can be seen that the pragmatics of paradiplomacy in Brazil – as well	107.70010375976562	192.817138671875	10.79998779296875	402.4703369140625	46
as in other countries where this phenomenon occurs – can involve a variety of	85.0000991821289	207.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.14354705810547	46
agreements from contracts to international agreements. There are different degrees of	85.0000991821289	222.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.13106536865234	46
commitment taken on by sub-national governments which raises questions about the	85.0000991821289	237.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.0931930541992	46
legal aspects of the phenomenon.	85.0000991821289	252.817138671875	10.79998779296875	165.07044219970703	46
2. Tendencies of Constitutionalization of Paradiplomacy in Federal States	99.2000732421875	285.71502685546875	10.800048828125	358.9686584472656	47
International law only recognizes as unquestioned legal entities the states and	85.0000991821289	306.57708740234375	10.79998779296875	425.08165740966797	48
international organizations – as well as a few entities close to these two categories	85.0000991821289	321.45709228515625	10.800018310546875	425.10042572021484	48
(Shaw, 2003). Therefore, from the traditional view of international relations, there is no	85.0000991821289	336.5771484375	10.79998779296875	425.0875778198242	48
clear answer as to what the legal reach of sub-national governments is the international	85.0000991821289	351.4571533203125	10.79998779296875	425.1758041381836	48
system. To rectify this issue, governments should turn to national norms as guidelines	85.0000991821289	366.5771484375	10.79998779296875	425.0466842651367	48
to define acceptable state action (Pellet 2002). This depends essentially on the degree	85.0000991821289	381.4571533203125	10.79998779296875	425.0623092651367	48
of decentralization of the federation: the higher decentralization is the greater the	85.0000991821289	396.5771484375	10.79998779296875	425.0815658569336	48
probability of constitutional permission for paradiplomacy.	85.0000991821289	411.4571533203125	10.79998779296875	279.37435150146484	48
The Brazilian federal constitution does not foresee international relationships	107.70010375976562	426.5771484375	10.79998779296875	402.406982421875	48
between sub-national governments, the federal district (Brasília, the federal capital)	85.0000991821289	441.4571533203125	10.79998779296875	425.1356735229492	48
and municipalities (Rodrigues 2008, p. 1019). In spite of this, the practice of foreign	85.0000991821289	456.5771484375	10.79998779296875	425.1357955932617	48
interaction with states has become deeper and more widespread among the sub-	85.0000991821289	471.4571533203125	10.79998779296875	425.13329315185547	48
national governments. The distance between practice and law in the sphere of	85.0000991821289	486.5771484375	10.79998779296875	425.3264694213867	48
paradiplomacy has a reason. It is difficult to create an appropriate legal framework that	85.0000991821289	501.4571533203125	10.79998779296875	425.12410736083984	48
can deal with the complexity of the process, as well as its dynamics.	85.0000991821289	516.5771484375	10.79998779296875	330.67589569091797	48
However the constitutionalization of paradiplomacy may bring restrictions to the	107.70010375976562	531.4571533203125	10.79998779296875	402.38226318359375	48
international action of the sub-national entities. Therefore, in understanding the	85.0000991821289	546.5771484375	10.79998779296875	425.17357635498047	48
obstacles of a possible constitutional reform, it is important to analyze the standards	85.0000991821289	561.4571533203125	10.79998779296875	425.0931625366211	48
adopted by federal states in adapting their legal frameworks with regard to (a) the kind	85.0000991821289	576.5771484375	10.79998779296875	425.0906295776367	48
of norms utilized, and (b) the material competencies designated, as well as (c) the	85.0000991821289	591.4571533203125	10.800003051757812	425.09716033935547	48
limits established.	85.0000991821289	606.5771484375	10.800003051757812	86.76459503173828	48
a) Norms: By definition, the federal constitution is the basic document which deals	99.2000732421875	621.4571533203125	10.817947387695312	410.8999328613281	48
with the division of competencies between federated entities; therefore, it should be the	85.0000991821289	636.5771484375	10.800003051757812	425.1310348510742	48
main instrument to define the possibility and the limits of paradiplomacy (Rezek 2005.)	85.0000991821289	651.4571533203125	10.800003051757812	425.13350677490234	48
With paradiplomacy foreseen in the constitution, it follows the principle of legality,	85.0000991821289	666.5771484375	10.800003051757812	425.14452362060547	48
inherent to administrative law which means that all actions of the public administration	85.0000991821289	681.4571533203125	10.800003051757812	425.04906463623047	48
should be guided by law. The federal constitution should establish the areas where	85.0000991821289	696.5771484375	10.800003051757812	425.10298919677734	48
involvement of the sub-national entities would be suitable and, therefore, underline the	85.0000991821289	711.4571533203125	10.799995422363281	425.09044647216797	48

centralization of power-- whether in the federation itself, or in the member states	85.0000991821289	117.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.11226654052734	51

Therefore, in most cases, the rules regulating international actions by members of	107.70010375976562	147.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	402.48504638671875	51
the federation have been done through constitutional amendments. That is what	85.0000991821289	162.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.12960052490234	51
happened in Belgium, with the constitutional reform of 1993, in Argentina in 1994 and,	85.0000991821289	177.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.14620208740234	51
in Austria in 2002. A different understanding of the issue occurred in the Mexican	85.0000991821289	192.817138671875	10.79998779296875	424.88997650146484	51
federation, which chose to normatize paradiplomacy through an infra-constitutional law.	85.0000991821289	207.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.14095306396484	51
In spite of the outspoken disagreement of the local constitutionalists with regard to the	85.0000991821289	222.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.2282943725586	51
suitability of this decree (Abraham 2007, p. 280). Since 1992 Mexico has had the “Law	85.0000991821289	237.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.0547103881836	51
of Celebration of Treaties” which widens the possibility of international participation with	85.0000991821289	252.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.10448455810547	51
some autonomy by sub-national entities. Therefore, although the Mexican constitution	85.0000991821289	267.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.0809860229492	51
affirms the impossibility of international agreements by non-central governments, an	85.0000991821289	282.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0910873413086	51
infra-constitutional norm admits this possibility.	85.0000991821289	297.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	226.78289031982422	51
b) Material competences: With regard to the issues about which the federal	120.45010375976562	312.817138671875	10.8179931640625	389.8265686035156	51
subunits may deal with in international agreements, it is usually established that they	85.0000991821289	327.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.11812591552734	51
may make agreements on any issue within their sphere of competence. The Swiss	85.0000991821289	342.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.09163665771484	51
constitution, for example, foresees the possibility of agreements between cantons and	85.0000991821289	357.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.07457733154297	51
foreign states, in which they must limit themselves to the competences of federated	85.0000991821289	372.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.1152877807617	51
entities. The German constitution is similar, indicating the possibility of member states	85.0000991821289	387.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.11226654052734	51
celebrating international agreements in the sphere of their attributions. The Austrian	85.0000991821289	402.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0554733276367	51
Constitution, which indicates that the Länder may sign treaties with states of	85.0000991821289	417.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.14730072021484	51
neighboring Austria or with other states, as long as they are within the competences	85.0000991821289	432.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.1041793823242	51
attributed to them.	85.0000991821289	447.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	88.58960723876953	51
To a lesser extent, there are cases in which federated entities only deal with	107.70010375976562	462.817138671875	10.79998779296875	402.3044128417969	51
issues related to their exclusive competences. This occurs often in Belgium. Although	85.0000991821289	477.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.09004974365234	51
in theory the Belgian Constitution allows for the possibility of agreements by	85.0000991821289	492.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0675277709961	51
communities and regions on issues within their competence, in practice, these	85.0000991821289	507.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.0965805053711	51
agreements mostly focus on issues of education and culture, which are exclusive	85.0000991821289	522.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.1202926635742	51
competences of sub-national governments. In practical terms, there is in the Belgian	85.0000991821289	537.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.1536178588867	51
case, a sharing of competences on treaties issues.	85.0000991821289	552.817138671875	10.79998779296875	246.98772430419922	51
The fact is that, without exception, legal provisions dealing with paradiplomacy	107.70010375976562	567.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	402.2872314453125	51
pigeon-hole state government into dealing with issues of low politics; like trade, culture	85.0000991821289	582.817138671875	10.817947387695312	425.0942916870117	51
and those issues that are not directly related to sovereignty or national security. This	85.0000991821289	597.9371337890625	10.800003051757812	425.10765838623047	51
can be seen in the constitutional dynamics of the federated states, which attributes to	85.0000991821289	612.817138671875	10.800003051757812	425.12764739990234	51
the central government the competence to deal with issues related to high politics.9	85.0000991821289	625.81103515625	12.944107055664062	403.2296371459961	51
c) Limits: The constitutionalization of paradiplomacy does not occur without	120.45010375976562	642.817138671875	10.817947387695312	389.77227783203125	51
precise limits. Besides the issue of delineating competences, there are also procedural	85.0000991821289	657.9371337890625	10.800003051757812	425.1526412963867	51
limits for sub-national governments to operate internationally. The most common	85.0000991821289	672.817138671875	10.800003051757812	425.08040618896484	51

approval vary. Some states grant the executive power; for example the ministry	85.0000991821289	132.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.1168441772461	56
responsible for foreign affairs has the authority to approve or not approve a negotiation	85.0000991821289	147.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	424.9648971557617	56
or agreement. In others, the Legislative branch has the power to approve these	85.0000991821289	162.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.1688766479492	56
agreements.	85.0000991821289	177.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	61.095603942871094	56
This limit imposed by some constitutions – in fact most of them – has a negative	107.70010375976562	192.817138671875	10.79998779296875	402.34918212890625	56
implication on the dynamics of paradiplomacy. The international actions of non-central	85.0000991821289	207.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.15404510498047	56
governments begin even before there is a constitutional reference about them – as in	85.0000991821289	222.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0792770385742	56
the Brazilian case. Therefore, when the matter becomes constitutionalized and begins	85.0000991821289	237.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.20674896240234	56
to require that every agreement should be previously approved by a central	85.0000991821289	252.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.33638763427734	56
government agency, the celerity of the movement is lost. Some interesting solutions	85.0000991821289	267.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.11412811279297	56
have been found to counter-act this problem. In Austria, the federal government must	85.0000991821289	282.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.12752532958984	56
be informed by the governor of the Land before negotiations of an international	85.0000991821289	297.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.09871673583984	56
agreement are initiated and then it has eight weeks to issue a decision. If there is no	85.0000991821289	312.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0972213745117	56
refusal during this period, it is tacitly understood that the request has been approved,	85.0000991821289	327.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.1030807495117	56
and the state government may start the negotiations.	85.0000991821289	342.817138671875	10.79998779296875	256.7213668823242	56
Another interesting case is that of the United States. The federal constitution says	107.70010375976562	357.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	402.3931884765625	56
that the federated subunits may have agreements abroad, with the stipulation that the	85.0000991821289	372.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0992660522461	56
state has the approval of U.S. Congress for the agreement to take effect. The	85.0000991821289	387.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.10607147216797	56
interpretation of this condition was initially restrictive, in the understanding that	85.0000991821289	402.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.1765670776367	56
Congress should be consulted about any foreign actions by non-central governments.	85.0000991821289	417.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.15465545654297	56
The intensification of paradiplomacy increased the scope – which was possible mostly	85.0000991821289	432.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.1333541870117	56
due to the fact that the United States is governed by a common law system. With the	85.0000991821289	447.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.0986862182617	56
dramatic increase of the number of agreements signed by single states today, there is	85.0000991821289	462.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.10106658935547	56
not full compliance with the constitutional requirement of a consultation to the U.S.	85.0000991821289	477.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.1608200073242	56
Congress (Lessa 2002, p. 41.) Many of these agreements are carried out directly	85.0000991821289	492.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.1333541870117	56
between the parties to save time. U.S. Congress itself, understanding the risk of its	85.0000991821289	507.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.0830612182617	56
operations could be compromised due to the number of agreements to be approved,	85.0000991821289	522.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.13118743896484	56
has interpreted that only agreements which interfere with security and the guidelines of	85.0000991821289	537.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.1905746459961	56
national foreign policy should be examined (Branco 2006, p.71.)	85.0000991821289	552.817138671875	10.79998779296875	311.2044906616211	56
The policy of approval works both ways as there can also be issues of	107.70010375976562	567.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	402.40380859375	56
compatibility with the foreign policy followed by central government. This fact is related	85.0000991821289	582.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0802230834961	56
to the classical view that the nation state should be seen as a unit in the international	85.0000991821289	597.9371337890625	10.800003051757812	425.16490936279297	56
system. This would be mitigated by policies on paradiplomacy that did not follow the	85.0000991821289	612.817138671875	10.800003051757812	425.06514739990234	56
guidelines dictated by central government. In the same way, internal governability	85.0000991821289	627.9371337890625	10.800003051757812	425.11495208740234	56
could be damaged if agreements of sub-national governments went against the	85.0000991821289	642.817138671875	10.800003051757812	425.06758880615234	56
interests of the federal government. This issue arises in commitments taken on by the	85.0000991821289	657.9371337890625	10.800003051757812	425.10469818115234	56
federal state. The agreements should not fail to harmonize with previous obligations	85.0000991821289	672.817138671875	10.800003051757812	425.0999069213867	56
assumed by central government whether in the national or international spheres.	85.0000991821289	687.9371337890625	10.800003051757812	391.3022689819336	56

3. In search of a legally ordained paradiplomacy in Brazil	99.2000732421875	115.5550537109375	10.800048828125	280.75653076171875	59
In recent years, the discussion on the need to legally ordain paradiplomacy has led to	85.0000991821289	136.4171142578125	10.79998779296875	425.2065658569336	60
an attempt to constitutionalize the matter as well as some efforts at infra-constitutional	85.0000991821289	151.537109375	10.79998779296875	425.1541976928711	60
legal framing.	85.0000991821289	166.4171142578125	10.79998779296875	65.9869155883789	60
In 2005 the constitutional amendment proposal no. 475 was sent to the Brazilian	107.70010375976562	181.537109375	10.79998779296875	402.4119567871094	60
congress. The amendment no. 475 regulated the action of member states, the federal	85.0000991821289	196.4171142578125	10.79998779296875	425.15624237060547	60
district and municipalities internationally. It did so through an addition to the	85.0000991821289	211.537109375	10.79998779296875	425.08748626708984	60
constitutional law that dealt with competences common to federated entities. If	85.0000991821289	226.4171142578125	10.79998779296875	425.15950775146484	60
approved, the constitution would state that these entities could bring about acts and	85.0000991821289	241.537109375	10.79998779296875	425.05297088623047	60
sign agreements or contracts with sub-national foreign governments, as long as the	85.0000991821289	256.4171142578125	10.79998779296875	425.0870895385742	60
constitutional competences for each entity were followed and the competences which	85.0000991821289	271.537109375	10.79998779296875	425.08309173583984	60
are exclusive to the union be avoided. The constitution, justice, and citizenship	85.0000991821289	286.4171142578125	10.79998779296875	425.0685043334961	60
committee of the national congress argued that the lack of explicit permission in the	85.0000991821289	301.537109375	10.79998779296875	425.0204086303711	60
constitution about international actions by federated members was not sufficient reason	85.0000991821289	316.4171142578125	10.79998779296875	425.05623626708984	60
to forbid it. The argument of the committee, although contrary to the majority view on	85.0000991821289	331.5371398925781	10.79998779296875	425.0483627319336	60
this issue, which states the need for the competences of federated entities to be stated	85.0000991821289	346.4171447753906	10.79998779296875	425.08296966552734	60
in the constitution, prevailed and the constitutional amendment proposal was rejected.	85.0000991821289	361.5371398925781	10.79998779296875	417.55297088623047	60
This was followed by attempts of non-constitutional legal framing. There is a	107.70010375976562	376.4171447753906	10.79998779296875	402.3688049316406	60
proposal in senate today10 substituting white paper supplementary law no. 98 from	85.0000991821289	389.39947509765625	12.937652587890625	425.03609466552734	60
2006. This proposal rules on the possibility of member states, municipalities and	85.0000991821289	406.4171447753906	10.79998779296875	425.08690643310547	60
federal district to act in the foreign sphere through signing agreements, which should	85.0000991821289	421.5371398925781	10.79998779296875	425.0851364135742	60
be examined previously by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is difficult to imagine how	85.0000991821289	436.4171447753906	10.79998779296875	425.0587692260742	60
approval could be attained with efficiency for Brazilian municipalities, which today	85.0000991821289	451.5371398925781	10.79998779296875	425.1149215698242	60

Besides the substitution proposal, there are two protocols in congress, signed by	107.70010375976562	481.5371398925781	10.79998779296875	402.39227294921875	60

provide a framework for paradiplomacy between the states in agreements. The	85.0000991821289	511.53717041015625	10.79998779296875	425.13216400146484	60
protocols indicate the importance of this movement and establish possible modalities of	85.0000991821289	526.4171752929688	10.79998779296875	425.21752166748047	60
the action of sub-national governments – in areas of their competence – as well as the	85.0000991821289	541.5371704101562	10.79998779296875	425.08504486083984	60
need for prior consent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the signing of agreements.	85.0000991821289	556.4171752929688	10.79998779296875	417.01659393310547	60

The lack of legal framing of paradiplomacy has both positive and negative	85.0000991821289	610.1771240234375	10.800003051757812	425.0815658569336	62
consequences in the Brazilian case. There a legitimate concern by the sub-national	85.0000991821289	625.05712890625	10.800003051757812	425.15352630615234	62
governments that, in inserting paradiplomacy in the legal framework, the limits are too	85.0000991821289	640.1771240234375	10.800003051757812	425.0339889526367	62
wide and the process becomes limited. These are almost inherent consequences to	85.0000991821289	655.05712890625	10.800003051757812	425.14171600341797	62
phenomena that develop outside legal principles. To imagine that each negotiation or	85.0000991821289	670.1771240234375	10.800003051757812	425.1366500854492	62
agreement carried out today at the initiative of sub-national governments has then to	85.0000991821289	685.05712890625	10.800003051757812	425.0771713256836	62

the phenomenon is the lack of guidance on the practice of sub-national international	85.0000991821289	222.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.15743255615234	66
relations. Also, an important concern is the possibility that state and municipal public	85.0000991821289	237.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.1357650756836	66
administration could have their actions questioned in court or in a court of auditors	85.0000991821289	252.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0765914916992	66
because they are beyond their constitutional competences. So far this has not occurred	85.0000991821289	267.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.08434295654297	66
for the executive power11. However, it is necessary to observe that the forms of	85.0000991821289	280.67950439453125	12.9376220703125	425.1218490600586	66
interaction of non-central governments in the international system have become	85.0000991821289	297.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.13463592529297	66
sophisticated, which raises the possibility of some kind of inspection.	85.0000991821289	312.817138671875	10.79998779296875	333.1554489135742	66
Another important issue related to the lack of a legal framework is the	107.70010375976562	327.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	402.3753967285156	66
responsibility for international agreements that are not upheld. In the Brazilian case, it	85.0000991821289	342.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.0642623901367	66
is not clear who would be responsible for default on agreements made by sub-national	85.0000991821289	357.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.15352630615234	66
governments. With the possibility of new government cycles, this hypothesis is	85.0000991821289	372.817138671875	10.79998779296875	425.05016326904297	66
especially serious because of the possible default on commitments assumed by	85.0000991821289	387.9371337890625	10.79998779296875	425.1257553100586	66
previous governments.	85.0000991821289	402.817138671875	10.79998779296875	111.23999786376953	66
Conclusion	85.0000991821289	433.9130554199219	12.0	65.3615951538086	67
As happened in other countries, Brazil faces a troublesome dichotomy on the	85.0000991821289	461.6171569824219	10.79998779296875	425.0678024291992	68
constitutionalization of paradiplomacy. There is no easy answer to the issue since the	85.0000991821289	476.49713134765625	10.79998779296875	425.07820892333984	68
contours of possible legislation on the theme can vary stalling the process. It is true	85.0000991821289	491.6171569824219	10.79998779296875	425.01317596435547	68
that the debates on the issue in Brazil are still at too early a stage to draw up an	85.0000991821289	506.49713134765625	10.79998779296875	425.1822738647461	68
adequate legal framing. Carrying out a constitutional reform that is coherent both with	85.0000991821289	521.6171264648438	10.79998779296875	425.02327728271484	68
the Brazilian legal system and the demands of the federal government and of the sub-	85.0000991821289	536.4971313476562	10.79998779296875	425.13329315185547	68
national governments seems unlikely at this time. This does not, however, reduce the	85.0000991821289	551.6171264648438	10.79998779296875	425.13280487060547	68
importance of deepening the dialogue. On the contrary, it reaffirms the need.	85.0000991821289	566.4971313476562	10.79998779296875	372.39266204833984	68
11 There are two lawsuits by the Rio Grande do Sul Public Prosecutor’s Office in Novo	85.0	617.6951904296875	11.927536010742188	425.103271484375	69

One of them is against 24 counselors and ex-counselors for mismanagement of public	99.2000732421875	642.5827026367188	9.840011596679688	410.8973083496094	69

plenary in favor of the trips to France, China and the Iberian Peninsula. According to the	99.2000732421875	676.9027099609375	9.840011596679688	410.9065246582031	69
