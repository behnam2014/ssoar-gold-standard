This article reviews the political history of Czechoslovakia as a vital part of the Soviet-dominated “Communist bloc” and its	53.6190185546875	298.8294677734375	9.96258544921875	487.6593017578125	7
repercussions for the journalist associations based in the country. Following an eventful history since 1918, Czechoslovakia	53.85801696777344	310.78448486328125	9.96258544921875	487.44996643066406	7
changed in 1948 from a liberal democracy into a Communist regime. This had significant consequences for journalists and	53.85801696777344	322.73944091796875	9.962615966796875	487.45008850097656	7

significant part in the fall of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe and led to the closing of the old Union of Journalists	53.85801696777344	370.5604248046875	9.96258544921875	487.4002227783203	7

The new Communist Constitution of May 1948 had	330.2980041503906	384.90643310546875	9.96258544921875	211.06759643554688	40

The heyday of the IOJ was in the late 1980s, when	68.802001953125	683.785400390625	9.962600708007812	211.10751342773438	54
