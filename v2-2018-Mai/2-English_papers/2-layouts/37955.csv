as a problem and enable us to see, for example, that environmental threats are	113.4000015258789	84.98382568359375	10.5	327.72594451904297	19

So what are the distinctive features of participatory rural appraisal? And	127.62014770507812	159.9853515625	10.5	313.5279235839844	19
does it achieve what it claims to do?	113.39999389648438	174.98565673828125	10.5	153.02804565429688	19

To answer these questions we must briefly explore the origins of the term and	113.4000015258789	228.98382568359375	10.5	327.75643157958984	21
look at some of its characteristics. Southern contexts such as Latin America	113.4000015258789	243.984130859375	10.5	327.7365036010742	21

Critics of African development such as Julius Nyerere of Tanzania argued	141.77999877929688	308.744873046875	10.02001953125	299.33245849609375	22

case studies cited in the latter part of this paper demonstrate. Often, therefore,	113.39999389648438	249.9871826171875	10.5	327.7449645996094	25

Chambers and Mayoux (2005: 26) acknowledge that there may be problems	113.4000015258789	84.98382568359375	10.5	327.7417526245117	46

Boyde (2000) adds to these concerns by pointing out that PRAs are often	127.62014770507812	144.98504638671875	10.5	313.5101318359375	46

managed by external forces’ so that participation actually becomes ‘covert	113.39999389648438	189.9859619140625	10.5	327.7848815917969	46
manipulation’ (pages unnumbered). He also reminds us that many of the	113.39999389648438	204.98626708984375	10.5	327.7449035644531	46
problems which communities unearth can be attributed to wider structural	113.39999389648438	219.986572265625	10.5	327.7082214355469	46
concerns, over which the facilitators of PRA projects have little control.	113.39999389648438	234.98687744140625	10.5	327.6714172363281	46
Sometimes these issues become so large that the process pays insufficient at-	113.39999389648438	249.9871826171875	10.5	327.77313232421875	46

lems. At other times there are attempts by researchers to claim more gener-	113.39999389648438	279.98779296875	10.5	327.72491455078125	46

The issue of power relations in PRA methodologies, can therefore be hid-	127.62014770507812	309.9884033203125	10.5	313.5457763671875	46
den in the discourse of ‘participatory’, thus re-creating all the problems that	113.39999389648438	324.98870849609375	10.5	327.70916748046875	46
participatory research claims to overcome. For instance Kapoor (2002) states	113.39999389648438	339.989013671875	10.5	327.72601318359375	46
that there is no quality assurance over the PRA process to ensure that discus-	113.39999389648438	354.98931884765625	10.5	327.65777587890625	46
sions are coercion free or the facilitator is not abusing his or her power and	113.39999389648438	369.9896240234375	10.5	327.5675048828125	46
authority (p.108). Kapoor also points out that it is unclear how PRA provides	113.39999389648438	384.98992919921875	10.5	327.72491455078125	46
opportunities to critique which community claims are erroneous. Further-	113.39999389648438	399.990234375	10.5	327.7628173828125	46

evitable tension between the development practitioner’s values and personal	113.39999389648438	429.9908447265625	10.5	327.7752990722656	46
agendas and those of the more career oriented and institutionally pressurised	113.39999389648438	444.99114990234375	10.5	327.7690124511719	46
academic require a constant trade-off between the ideology of participation	113.39999389648438	459.991455078125	10.5	327.79620361328125	46
and the reality of the research process. Cottrell and Parpart (2006) suggest	113.39999389648438	474.99176025390625	10.5	327.7806701660156	46
that frank and open discussions from the beginning may help to resolve some	113.39999389648438	489.9920654296875	10.5	327.7796325683594	46
of these issues.	113.39999389648438	504.99237060546875	10.5	63.47669982910156	46
Finally Kapoor (2002) articulates the concern that participatory appraisal	127.62014770507812	519.99267578125	10.5	313.54364013671875	46
literature is under-theorised. Although issues of empowerment and participa-	113.39999389648438	534.9929809570312	10.5	327.758544921875	46
tion are central to its work, there is almost no reference to theoretical notions	113.39999389648438	549.9932861328125	10.5	327.6798095703125	46
of power or democracy. He cites Foucault’s concept of power as a relation-	113.39999389648438	564.9935913085938	10.5	327.79217529296875	46
ship and the role that power plays in legitimising knowledge. He also refers	113.39999389648438	579.993896484375	10.5	327.5738220214844	46

to Habermasian literature that discusses deliberative democracy as a strategy	113.4000015258789	84.98382568359375	10.5	327.79210662841797	48
for challenging the state. The absence of such a critical theoretical overview,	113.4000015258789	99.984130859375	10.5	327.7616195678711	48
he argues, means that ‘difference’ is denied in the pursuit of consensus and	113.4000015258789	114.98443603515625	10.5	327.71431732177734	48
political activism is suppressed in favour of liberalism (Kapoor 2002: 114f.).	113.4000015258789	129.9847412109375	10.5	323.4546432495117	48
Many of the above criticisms could apply to the mis-use of any methodol-	127.62014770507812	144.98504638671875	10.5	313.4796447753906	48
ogy, of course. Chambers and Mayoux (2005) suggest we should look at the	113.39999389648438	159.9853515625	10.5	327.7438049316406	48
problem slightly differently. For instance we should ask how reliable is the	113.39999389648438	174.98565673828125	10.5	327.82037353515625	48
alternative – quantitative, top down collected data - in addressing the above	113.39999389648438	189.9859619140625	10.5	327.7459411621094	48
concerns, especially those of power relations and the inter-linkages between	113.39999389648438	204.98626708984375	10.5	327.7912292480469	48
multi-dimensional aspects of poverty (Chambers/Mayoux 2005: 4). From	113.39999389648438	219.986572265625	10.5	327.7963562011719	48

gies, to minimise their deficiencies. Chambers and Mayoux point out that lo-	113.39999389648438	249.9871826171875	10.5	327.7532958984375	48
cal people’s knowledge is more useful for community analysis than ‘official’	113.39999389648438	264.98748779296875	10.5	327.7449035644531	48

Also analysis should be ongoing, rather than short, one-off exercises. The tri-	113.39999389648438	309.9884033203125	10.5	327.8236389160156	48

ness, but the range of tools used need not include diagrams or methods that	113.39999389648438	339.989013671875	10.5	327.69769287109375	48

So, they and others argue, it is down to questions of ethics as to whose voices	113.4000015258789	524.9638671875	10.5	327.7480697631836	52

of placing so much emphasis on accepting the validity of community data at	113.4000015258789	249.9871826171875	10.5	327.7627182006836	54

The project was stimulated by cooperative extension educators who wanted	113.4000015258789	234.98382568359375	10.5	327.7816390991211	101

do with time management, transport and attention spans were also cited	113.39999389648438	294.98809814453125	10.5	327.77740478515625	103
(Doyle/Krasny 2003: 103). The youth found interviewing a more familiar	113.39999389648438	309.9884033203125	10.5	327.8089904785156	103
technique, stimulated by the fact that the gardeners loved telling stories, but	113.39999389648438	324.98870849609375	10.5	327.73541259765625	103
the gardeners felt more awkward when asked to draw a map or diagram.	113.39999389648438	339.989013671875	10.5	327.7606201171875	103
Nevertheless, they eventually became deeply engaged in mapping their plots,	113.39999389648438	354.98931884765625	10.5	327.8121032714844	103
when the youth started drawing a map and asking gardeners for help in filling	113.39999389648438	369.9896240234375	10.5	327.8708801269531	103
the details. The message here, of course, is to fit methods to context.	113.39999389648438	384.98992919921875	10.5	288.4118957519531	103
The expertise of the older, minority ethnic research ‘subjects’ and the age	127.62014770507812	399.990234375	10.5	313.537353515625	103
differentials for the youth researchers suggest that perhaps power differentials	113.39999389648438	414.99053955078125	10.5	327.74908447265625	103
and the subsequent learning processes were unusually complementary in this	113.39999389648438	429.9908447265625	10.5	327.7616882324219	103
project. So, for instance, the youth acquired substantial historical knowledge	113.39999389648438	444.99114990234375	10.5	327.76580810546875	103
about the evolution of the gardens, the influence of surrounding environment	113.39999389648438	459.991455078125	10.5	327.7775573730469	103
such as pollution on the gardens and connections between the garden and	113.39999389648438	474.99176025390625	10.5	327.6366882324219	103
broader city. They increased their knowledge about soils and soil testing.	113.39999389648438	489.9920654296875	10.5	327.7376403808594	103
Through the necessary listening process of interviewing they were able to	113.39999389648438	504.99237060546875	10.5	327.8656921386719	103
build a relationship with the gardeners. By the same token the educators	113.39999389648438	519.99267578125	10.5	327.7952880859375	103

than participants in a shared objective. The youths’ own communication and	113.4000015258789	365.9666748046875	10.5	327.7763900756836	109

the activities. A general observation was that all participants needed longer	113.4000015258789	395.96728515625	10.5	327.71971893310547	109

A number of observations can be made concerning the relevance of literature	113.4000015258789	569.9638671875	10.5	327.70604705810547	111

On the plus side the above cases demonstrate the versatility of the partici-	127.62000274658203	84.98382568359375	10.5	313.59300994873047	113

ness of participatory rural appraisal – or participatory appraisal (PA) as it is	113.39985656738281	114.98443603515625	10.5	327.74586486816406	113
now coming to be known – originated as a methodology that was applied to	113.39985656738281	129.9847412109375	10.5	327.7648468017578	113

moved from public decision making processes. These issues can be applied	113.39985656738281	159.9853515625	10.5	327.77537536621094	113
globally to marginalised groups and people whose levels of literacy, or	113.39985656738281	174.98565673828125	10.5	327.84889221191406	113

that affect their lives. PA not only broadens the range of strategies available	113.39985656738281	204.98626708984375	10.5	327.7489776611328	113
to low literacy groups. It can also be effective in community mobilisation.	113.39985656738281	219.986572265625	10.5	327.67552185058594	113
The studies demonstrated the opportunity for data collection partnerships that	113.39985656738281	234.98687744140625	10.5	327.87608337402344	113

searchers and participants. As a result of these opportunities and dynamics,	113.39985656738281	264.98748779296875	10.5	327.85523986816406	113
knowledge was secured that would otherwise have been hidden (for example,	113.39985656738281	279.98779296875	10.5	327.84678649902344	113

often then emerges as a re-working of solutions that are context sensitive.	113.39985656738281	324.98870849609375	10.5	327.73130798339844	113
The outcomes should not be overstated, but methods can be used to provide	113.39985656738281	339.989013671875	10.5	327.71446228027344	113

tory research perhaps lies in the criticism that it is under-theorised. Therein	113.39985656738281	444.99114990234375	10.5	327.68714904785156	113

agenda for HIV/AIDS change strategies alone. In the urban garden project	113.39999389648438	279.98779296875	10.5	327.7259826660156	115
follow up action did ensue, but it was not necessarily action for change and it	113.39999389648438	294.98809814453125	10.5	327.7342834472656	115
was not clear whether any such action had been prioritised.	113.39999389648438	309.9884033203125	10.5	249.34445190429688	115
An overall criticism of the quality of, and suitability of, data gathering	127.62014770507812	324.98870849609375	10.5	313.5951232910156	115
techniques lies, arguably, not just in the newness of those techniques but also	113.39999389648438	339.989013671875	10.5	327.7049865722656	115
in the quality of facilitation training. The case studies cited above seem to	113.39999389648438	354.98931884765625	10.5	327.8161926269531	115
share the need for facilitation skills that derive from good adult education	113.39999389648438	369.9896240234375	10.5	327.75341796875	115
practice. So participatory appraisal methodologies require a combination of	113.39999389648438	384.98992919921875	10.5	327.83941650390625	115
pedagogical and cultural sensitivity skills that stretch beyond those normally	113.39999389648438	399.990234375	10.5	327.8269958496094	115
required of a lone researcher who may be more practised at moving into a re-	113.39999389648438	414.99053955078125	10.5	327.82470703125	115
search environment, collecting data and then moving back out to analyse it	113.39999389648438	429.9908447265625	10.5	327.79425048828125	115
independently. Whilst methods are adaptable, there is sometimes an apparent	113.39999389648438	444.99114990234375	10.811859130859375	327.7470397949219	115
mismatch between the researcher-facilitator’s skills and the participants’	113.39895629882812	459.991455078125	10.5	327.7155456542969	115
skills and understanding. Again time and flexibility need to accommodate	113.39895629882812	474.99176025390625	10.5	327.80267333984375	115

Other criticisms of PA’s credibility as a research approach must also take	127.61911010742188	504.99237060546875	10.5	313.5162658691406	115
into account that no research is value free. Participatory research is not de-	113.39895629882812	519.99267578125	10.5	327.8110046386719	115

valuable for the participants. Action research is centred around engaging	113.39895629882812	549.9932861328125	10.5	327.8100891113281	115

goal. In view of the fact that poverty is multi dimensional and multi-	113.4000015258789	114.98443603515625	10.5	327.81945037841797	117
directional (Eversole/Routh 2005) it would seem important to operationlise	113.4000015258789	129.9847412109375	10.5	327.75756072998047	117
the findings at several levels. As researchers we also have a responsibility to	113.4000015258789	144.98504638671875	10.5	327.71443939208984	117
reach as large an audience as possible. So whilst we may be furthering our	113.4000015258789	159.9853515625	10.5	327.6808395385742	117

will be accepted by those wider structures in society that continue to provide	113.4000015258789	204.98626708984375	10.5	327.72078704833984	117
marginalising infrastructures, legislation and attitudinal barriers. At the same	113.4000015258789	219.986572265625	10.5	327.8121871948242	117

a longer term strategy than PA alone can allow.	113.4000015258789	384.98992919921875	10.5	200.20873260498047	117
We must be realistic, however. It is highly unlikely that participatory or	127.62014770507812	399.990234375	10.5	313.5111083984375	117

community of different voices. Perhaps the best we can hope for is to start a	113.39999389648438	429.9908447265625	10.5	327.7165832519531	117

positive elements of this kind of research. The process, however, has to be	113.39999389648438	474.99176025390625	10.5	327.7092590332031	117

This, then, is the final justification for participatory appraisal. If participa-	127.62014770507812	504.99237060546875	10.5	313.46697998046875	117
