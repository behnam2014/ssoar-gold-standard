Sex-selective abortion (SSA) is a subject that raises troubling questions	62.66210174560547	454.15057373046875	9.962997436523438	322.79431915283203	11

answer. My article was a step towards addressing this complex issue. I am	62.66210174560547	478.059814453125	9.962997436523438	322.7814407348633	11
grateful therefore to my discussants for their thoughtful comments on my	62.66210174560547	490.014404296875	9.962997436523438	322.8002700805664	11

Before I respond to what I take to be their major criticisms, let me	74.61770629882812	513.9246215820312	9.962997436523438	310.8327331542969	11
correct a factual misunderstanding. The Netherlands does not have, as	62.662105560302734	525.8801879882812	9.963005065917969	322.781436920166	11
Miriam Ticktin thinks, a policy of free access to pre-natal diagnostics	62.662105560302734	537.8358154296875	9.962997436523438	322.79135513305664	11
(PND), nor am I arguing that it should have.	62.662105560302734	549.7913818359375	9.962997436523438	195.0526466369629	11
Ticktin claims that I am taking a culturalistic perspective that would	74.61770629882812	561.7460327148438	9.962997436523438	310.8467102050781	11
prevent me from seeing what is really at stake. SSA is a practice that,	62.662105560302734	573.7015991210938	9.962997436523438	322.7873878479004	11
according to her, is shaped by state violence against and discrimination of	62.662105560302734	585.6572265625	9.962997436523438	322.7923927307129	11

immigrant minority groups. I have no problem in acknowledging that the	56.54909896850586	70.3409423828125	9.96295166015625	322.79233169555664	14
Netherlands’ policy towards immigrant groups is harsh and that the racist	56.54909896850586	82.2955322265625	9.96295166015625	322.78940200805664	14
prejudice the Dutch display against immigrants is alarming. Yet they do not	56.54909896850586	94.2501220703125	9.96295166015625	322.79932022094727	14
constitute the cause of SSA. At the root of the problem is a cultural son	56.54909896850586	106.2047119140625	9.96295166015625	322.79529190063477	14
preference and we should be prepared to acknowledge this.	56.54909896850586	118.1593017578125	9.96295166015625	259.5501136779785	14
This sex preference is linked to the tradition of providing a daughter with	68.50469970703125	130.11492919921875	9.96295166015625	310.83770751953125	14
a dowry when she marries. In my article, I explained that, due to a process	56.54909896850586	142.070556640625	9.962982177734375	322.78134536743164	14
of commodiﬁcation of the tradition, some families now demand very expen-	56.54909896850586	154.026123046875	9.9630126953125	322.80029678344727	14
sive consumer goods for a dowry gift and therefore a daughter’s marriage	56.54909896850586	165.98171997070312	9.9630126953125	322.78036880493164	14
may economically ruin a family. This is an important background to this sex	56.54909896850586	177.93731689453125	9.9630126953125	322.79126358032227	14
preference. I think, therefore, that I deploy a more materialist notion of	56.54909896850586	189.89291381835938	9.9630126953125	322.79135513305664	14
culture than Ticktin thinks.	56.54909896850586	201.8485107421875	9.9630126953125	118.46803665161133	14
Monica Mookherjee believes that I leave women in the cold who are	68.50469970703125	213.8031005859375	9.9630126953125	310.809814453125	14
pressurized into ‘choosing’ SSA, because I do not pay enough attention to the	56.54909896850586	225.75869750976562	9.9630126953125	322.74744033813477	14
social conditions under which these women make their choice. According to	56.54909896850586	237.71429443359375	9.9630126953125	322.765323638916	14
her I herewith display a non-relational view on autonomy that sees all of us	56.54909896850586	249.66989135742188	9.9630126953125	322.74545669555664	14
as equally free to determine our lives, while Ticktin suggests that I see western	56.54909896850586	261.62548828125	9.9630126953125	322.809268951416	14
women as fully autonomous and the rest of us as non-autonomous victims of	56.54909896850586	273.5810852050781	9.9630126953125	322.77124404907227	14
our culture. I agree that I did not discuss at length how Asian women’s	56.54909896850586	285.53668212890625	9.9630126953125	322.75635147094727	14
autonomy can be enhanced, as my focus was on whether measures to ban	56.54909896850586	297.4922790527344	9.9630126953125	322.709659576416	14
SSA should include restricting access to abortion. I consider both Dutch and	56.54909896850586	309.4478759765625	9.9630126953125	322.720645904541	14
Asian women as capable of autonomy, yet both as also constrained in	56.54909896850586	321.4034729003906	9.9630126953125	322.72351455688477	14
exercising their autonomy, albeit by different social and cultural conditions.	56.54909896850586	333.35906982421875	9.9630126953125	322.71557998657227	14
Making the abortion law more restrictive does not lift these constraints.	56.54909896850586	345.3146667480469	9.9630126953125	322.7176856994629	14
Social policy may, however, and therefore this is what I see as a better way	56.54909896850586	357.270263671875	9.9630126953125	322.6996192932129	14
to offer protection to women who are pressurized to undergo a SSA.	56.54909896850586	369.2258605957031	9.9630126953125	296.4242286682129	14
Anne Phillips’s main worry, which she shares with Monica Mookherjee,	68.50469970703125	381.18145751953125	9.9630126953125	310.8316955566406	14
is that my contextualism will end in pure pragmatism. Phillips expresses the	56.54909896850586	393.1370544433594	9.9630126953125	322.79541397094727	14
classical philosophical preference: ﬁrst we determine whether a practice is	56.54909896850586	405.0926513671875	9.962997436523438	322.78931045532227	14
morally right or wrong (the philosopher’s job), and once we know what	56.54909896850586	417.0482177734375	9.962997436523438	322.7822608947754	14
justice requires, the policymaker decides on the implementation of actual	56.54909896850586	429.00384521484375	9.962997436523438	322.79529190063477	14
policy. The actual policy-outcome may be co-determined by pragmatic	56.54909896850586	440.95941162109375	9.962997436523438	322.79928970336914	14
concerns, but these fall outside the philosophical analysis. I do not believe	56.54909896850586	452.9150390625	9.962997436523438	322.7914161682129	14
in this neat job delineation, moreover, I think that what to do as a matter	56.54909896850586	464.87060546875	9.962997436523438	322.789249420166	14
of policy is a question that normally also involves moral considerations.	56.54909896850586	476.82623291015625	9.962997436523438	311.2223243713379	14
To illustrate my point let me bring forward Stephen Macedo’s discussion	68.50469970703125	488.78082275390625	9.962997436523438	310.8396911621094	14
of the Mozert and the Yoder cases. In Mozert v. Hawkins, a conﬂict over	56.54909896850586	500.7364501953125	9.962997436523438	322.7872657775879	14
public education and religious diversity, orthodox Christian parents	56.54909896850586	512.6920166015625	9.962997436523438	322.79321670532227	14
objected to the school’s mandatory basic reading program that exposed	56.54909896850586	524.6475830078125	9.962997436523438	322.78427505493164	14
their children to a variety of worldviews. The parents claimed a right to	56.54909896850586	536.6032104492188	9.962997436523438	322.78732681274414	14
exempt their children from the reading program, while remaining in the	56.54909896850586	548.558837890625	9.962997436523438	322.792423248291	14
public schools (Macedo, 1995: 472). Macedo decided that on principled	56.54909896850586	560.514404296875	9.962997436523438	322.78137588500977	14
grounds the Mozert families should not be accommodated. He added to this	56.54909896850586	572.4700317382812	9.962997436523438	322.7962074279785	14
that there are also prudential reasons that might be considered – school	56.54909896850586	584.4255981445312	9.962997436523438	322.787296295166	14

administrators might anticipate that the families would otherwise withdraw	62.66210174560547	70.3409423828125	9.96295166015625	322.8003616333008	17
their children altogether from the public school system and for that reason	62.66210174560547	82.2955322265625	9.96295166015625	322.79434967041016	17
accommodate them – but these come secondary, and he even doubted	62.66210174560547	94.2501220703125	9.96295166015625	322.79029083251953	17
whether courts should at all examine these ‘additional grounds’, as he called	62.66210174560547	106.2047119140625	9.96295166015625	322.78845977783203	17
them (1995: 487, 488). Hence, Macedo distinguished between principle-	62.66210174560547	118.1593017578125	9.96295166015625	322.7834243774414	17
based and pragmatic arguments while arguing that we should take into	62.66210174560547	130.1138916015625	9.96295166015625	322.7844009399414	17

dating the Mozert parents, thought it right to accommodate the more	62.66210174560547	154.02304077148438	9.9630126953125	322.7952346801758	17
radical claim of Amish’ parents (the Yoder case) to altogether withdraw	62.66210174560547	165.97763061523438	9.9630126953125	322.79419708251953	17
their school-aged children from high school, since the Amish, because of	62.66210174560547	177.90353393554688	9.99169921875	322.79126739501953	17
their small number, pose no threat to public order (1995: 472, 489). Hence,	62.662109375	189.859130859375	9.99169921875	322.7684020996094	17
it was ultimately a pragmatic argument about numbers (sic!) that settled for	62.66211700439453	201.84341430664062	9.9630126953125	322.80318450927734	17
Macedo whether to accommodate or not. Contextual arguments inter-	62.66211700439453	213.79901123046875	9.9630126953125	322.7913131713867	17
penetrate with principled arguments. In a contextual approach, this is	62.66211700439453	225.75460815429688	9.9630126953125	322.7872848510742	17
acknowledged and considered as inescapable. Principles are generic and as	62.66211700439453	237.710205078125	9.9630126953125	322.7794723510742	17
such underdetermined. To make sense of them and to be able to make a	62.66211700439453	249.66580200195312	9.9630126953125	322.78023529052734	17
judgement in speciﬁc cases we need contexts.	62.66211700439453	261.62139892578125	9.9630126953125	196.77623748779297	17
This being said, I do share Phillips’s worry that there is the risk to Carens’s	74.61772155761719	273.57598876953125	9.9630126953125	310.8137969970703	17
– and as I follow his approach (Carens, 2000), also my – contextualism that	62.6621208190918	285.5315856933594	9.9630126953125	322.8062324523926	17
we end up with a kind of ‘moral casuistry’, as Seyla Benhabib so aptly phrases	62.6621208190918	297.4871826171875	9.9630126953125	322.8132514953613	17
it (2002: 125). By this she means the risk that we confuse ‘the normatively	62.6621208190918	309.4427795410156	9.9630126953125	322.8101387023926	17
right’ with ‘the institutionally feasible’ (2002: 125). The problem with	62.6621208190918	321.39837646484375	9.9630126953125	322.8081855773926	17
Carens’s contextual approach is that pragmatic arguments may co-determine	62.6621208190918	333.3539733886719	9.9630126953125	322.8111457824707	17
our moral deliberation, yet it remains unclear to what extent. I think	62.6621208190918	345.3095703125	9.9630126953125	322.7674140930176	17
Benhabib touches the sore spot in Carens’s approach, yet I do not see a ready	62.6621208190918	357.2651672363281	9.9630126953125	322.8032417297363	17
solution. New rules of lexical priority? Which ones? Besides, they seem to	62.6621208190918	369.22076416015625	9.9630126953125	322.8071479797363	17
go against the grain of the approach. In the meantime, unsatisfactory as it	62.6621208190918	381.1763610839844	9.9630126953125	322.8111763000488	17
may seem, we have no choice but to contextually argue it out.	62.6621208190918	393.1319580078125	9.9630126953125	263.9886360168457	17
