Abstract	113.25	106.231201171875	15.75	64.423095703125	9
Since the Treaty of Maastricht transparency and openness have been prominent catchwords	113.25	143.9356689453125	9.75	409.98980712890625	10
to counter the European Union’s (EU) so called ‘democratic deficit’. The working paper	113.25	159.6856689453125	9.75	411.04534912109375	10
discusses the rank and position of these principles in democratic theory and looks at their	113.25	174.6856689453125	9.75	408.84051513671875	10
realisation at the EU level. Since the EU-bodies equal transparency and openness mainly	113.25	190.4356689453125	9.75	410.14837646484375	10
with access to information the paper concentrates on the question, which institution is willing	113.25	206.1856689453125	9.75	409.6019287109375	10
to provide best for access to documents. In the course of shaping a new regulation on	113.25	221.1856689453125	9.75	411.05841064453125	10
access to documents in May 2001, the contrasting views of Commission, European	113.25	236.9356689453125	9.75	411.016845703125	10
Parliament and Council showed up in their respective draft proposals. The different	113.25	252.6856689453125	9.75	411.0848388671875	10
proposals are analysed and assessed with regard to transparency and openness.	113.25	267.6856689453125	9.75	351.7869567871094	10
Zusammenfassung	113.25	311.731201171875	15.75	145.36795043945312	11
Seit dem Vertrag von Maastricht dienen die Begriffe “Transparenz” und “Offenheit” als	113.25	348.6856689453125	9.75	411.10626220703125	12
beliebte Schlagwörter, um dem sogenannten Demokratiedefizit der Europäischen Union	113.25	364.4356689453125	9.75	411.062744140625	12
(EU) zu begegnen. Das Working Paper widmet sich dem Stellenwert dieser Prinzipien in der	113.25	380.1856689453125	9.75	409.42523193359375	12
Demokratietheorie und zeichnet ihre Implementierung auf EU-Ebene nach. Da die EU-	113.25	395.1856689453125	9.75	411.24676513671875	12
Institutionen Transparenz und Offenheit hauptsächlich mit Zugang zu Informationen	113.25	410.9356689453125	9.75	411.074951171875	12
gleichsetzen, konzentriert sich die Analyse auf die Frage, welche Institution für den	113.25	426.6856689453125	9.75	411.0133056640625	12
bestmöglichsten Zugang eintritt. Im Mai 2001 wurde eine neue Verordnung über den Zugang	113.25	441.6856689453125	9.75	410.08001708984375	12

1. Introduction	113.25	106.981201171875	15.75	109.53094482421875	25
Since the early 1990s scholarly debate and political rhetoric has increasingly concentrated	113.25	143.9356689453125	9.75	408.6900634765625	26
on the issue of democratization of the European Union. This shift in perspective is mainly	113.25	159.6856689453125	9.75	409.81103515625	26
due to the “organic and evolutionary way” (Westlake 1998: 127) of the Union’s development.	113.25	174.6856689453125	9.75	409.95745849609375	26
Along with the increase in communitarized policy fields and a growing number of decisions	113.25	190.4356689453125	9.75	409.58941650390625	26
taking place at the European level, the question of legitimacy in the European Union	113.25	206.1856689453125	9.75	411.04693603515625	26
substantially gained in importance. Although the single Member States continue to enjoy	113.25	221.1856689453125	9.75	408.74462890625	26
democratic legitimacy of policy-making in the national arena by well-established	113.25	236.9356689453125	9.75	410.9835205078125	26
mechanisms, the fusion of national and supranational policies is attended with deficiencies in	113.25	252.6856689453125	9.75	409.705078125	26
legitimacy. This became obvious with rising popular discontent accompanying the shaping of	113.25	267.6856689453125	9.75	409.35113525390625	26
the Maastricht Treaty.	113.25	283.4356689453125	9.75	94.51759338378906	26
One of the solutions offered by the European Union to counter the so-called ‘democratic	113.25	314.1856689453125	9.75	409.848388671875	27
deficit’ has been the call for more transparency and openness in the working of the European	113.25	329.9356689453125	9.75	409.69970703125	27
Union’s institutions and the decision-making at the European level. In the EU’s actual steps	113.25	345.6856689453125	9.75	410.41552734375	27
to increase transparency and openness, the notion of these principles has been mainly	113.25	360.6856689453125	9.75	409.90997314453125	27
realized in access to information. ‘An ever closer Union’ where decisions are taken ‘as open	113.25	376.4356689453125	9.75	409.342529296875	27
as possible’ seemed achievable by changing the ways of how to grant citizens access to	113.25	392.1856689453125	9.75	408.50982666015625	27
documents. But how open is ‘open as possible’?	113.25	407.1856689453125	9.75	209.34915161132812	27
Since the EU equals openness and transparency mainly with access to information the	113.25	438.6856689453125	9.75	411.0052490234375	28
relevant provisions may reveal how these principles are implemented. The issue in question	113.25	453.6856689453125	9.75	408.99676513671875	28
has been put once more on the EU-agenda recently. Following the obligations of the	113.25	469.4356689453125	9.75	411.0623779296875	28
Amsterdam Treaty, the Council in codecision with the European Parliament agreed on a new	113.25	485.1856689453125	9.75	409.55242919921875	28
regulation on access to documents in May 2001. Until then, the Commission, the Council,	113.25	500.1856689453125	9.75	409.48883056640625	28
and the European Parliament followed fairly the same codes of conduct. However, research	113.25	515.9356689453125	9.75	408.94476318359375	28
indicates that the EU bodies interpreted access to documents in different ways (Gronbech-	113.25	531.6856689453125	9.75	411.24676513671875	28
Jensen 1998). The proposals issued by the Commission, the European Parliament, and the	113.25	546.6856689453125	9.75	409.11962890625	28
Council allow a comparison of the present views on how to define and restrict openness and	113.25	562.4356689453125	9.75	410.20263671875	28
transparency. The analysis will concentrate on the question, which EU-institution is willing to	113.25	578.1856689453125	9.75	409.82373046875	28
provide best for access to information thus providing for democratic legitimacy through	113.25	593.1856689453125	9.75	411.05548095703125	28
transparency and openness.	113.25	608.9356689453125	9.75	123.02488708496094	28
In the course of this paper transparency and openness will be pinned down to the specific	113.25	640.4356689453125	9.75	409.68511962890625	29
instrument of access to documents that is designed to fulfill a specific purpose in a specific	113.25	655.4356689453125	9.75	409.96429443359375	29
institutional arrangement. It will be looked at how major players in the framework of the	113.25	671.1856689453125	9.75	411.0545654296875	29
European Union aim to fulfill the basic ideas of these catchwords. The first part of the paper	113.25	686.9356689453125	9.75	409.39874267578125	29
concentrates on the rank and position of transparency and openness in democratic theory	113.25	701.9356689453125	9.75	409.2972412109375	29
and looks at how these principles have evolved and been realized by the main European	113.25	717.6856689453125	9.75	411.1036376953125	29

2. The debate on transparency and openness	71.25	184.231201171875	15.75	343.36322021484375	32
The discussion on transparency and openness in the European Union covers a large variety	71.25	221.1856689453125	9.75	409.8970642089844	33
of perspectives. In terms of a lack of democratic legitimacy, the two ideas are closely related	71.25	236.9356689453125	9.75	409.61126708984375	33
to an ‘information deficit’ (Lodge 1994). Transparency through information is perceived as a	71.25	252.6856689453125	9.75	408.8421936035156	33
major instrument to improve democracy in the EU thus not only taming the secretive nature	71.25	267.6856689453125	9.75	409.1833801269531	33
of the Council’s policy-making (Curtin 1995). The Council’s policy has been proven to be	71.25	283.4356689453125	9.75	409.2281494140625	33
disappointing when focusing on special requests for documents (Carvel 1998). Closely	71.25	299.1856689453125	9.75	411.0635070800781	33
related to the Council’s information policy in general is its strong position in the	71.25	314.1856689453125	9.75	411.0094909667969	33
intergovernmental pillars which consequently renders fields as Justice and Home Affairs	71.25	329.9356689453125	9.75	409.35894775390625	33
hardly accessible (de Boer 1998). The Community’s policy is generally discussed highly	71.25	345.6856689453125	9.75	408.4989318847656	33
critical hence advocating more transparency, openness, and visibility (Guggenbühl 1998).	71.25	360.6856689453125	9.75	408.35888671875	33
Comparative research has shown that the Community’s standards do not come up to the	71.25	376.4356689453125	9.75	408.91253662109375	33
tradition of the Nordic countries in open government, suggesting the latter as a solution for	71.25	392.1856689453125	9.75	408.8558654785156	33
the Union’s problems in legitimacy (Gronbech-Jensen 1998). However, contributions from	71.25	407.1856689453125	9.75	408.72821044921875	33
information professionals indicate that access to information has changed for the better	71.25	422.9356689453125	9.75	411.06829833984375	33
(Thomson 1998). This is confirmed by historic review pointing out that transparency has	71.25	438.6856689453125	9.75	408.4586181640625	33
enormously improved, which is partly due to the impact of an expanded role of the European	71.25	453.6856689453125	9.75	409.52166748046875	33
Parliament (Westlake 1998). Transparency is nowadays seen at the very heart of ‘good	71.25	469.4356689453125	9.75	411.10284423828125	33
administration’ (Söderman 2000). The European Ombudsman Jacob Söderman likewise	71.25	485.1856689453125	9.75	411.064453125	33
focuses on the democratic nature of the principle. The free flow of information and ideas	71.25	500.1856689453125	9.75	408.7850036621094	33
between departments could very well further transparent and efficient administration which is	71.25	515.9356689453125	9.75	410.28594970703125	33
e.g. in the Commission highly troubled by the fact that different Directorate Generals are in a	71.25	531.6856689453125	9.75	409.5848083496094	33
“state of near civil war” (Lord 1998: 83). However, these approaches neglect the internal	71.25	546.6856689453125	9.75	408.5392761230469	33
working of an institution and its internal transparency.	71.25	562.4356689453125	9.75	230.2747802734375	33
2.1. Defining transparency and openness	71.25	596.7713623046875	12.0	233.96218872070312	34
The common denominator of these different approaches is their linking of transparency and	71.25	630.6856689453125	9.75	408.87835693359375	35
openness to legitimacy. They are focusing on the transparency of political institutions in their	71.25	645.6856689453125	9.75	410.31427001953125	35
relation to civil society, be they private individual or business interest, the media or elected	71.25	661.4356689453125	9.75	408.893798828125	35
representatives. However, definitions of transparency vary among the various approaches	71.25	677.1856689453125	9.75	411.1131591796875	35
and stress particular features of the underlying idea. Transparency is viewed and defined	71.25	692.1856689453125	9.75	408.7229919433594	35
differently: ranging from a narrow perspective of simple and clear procedures up to as broad	71.25	707.9356689453125	9.75	409.1988220214844	35
as “effective popular access to the decision making process” (de Boer 1998: 99).	71.25	723.6856689453125	9.75	411.0434265136719	35
Transparency at its simplest is “the ability to look clearly through the windows of an	71.25	738.6856689453125	9.75	411.1004943847656	35
I H S — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — 3	267.75	38.20355224609375	9.54473876953125	256.2540283203125	36
institution” (de Boer 1998: 105). The very idea is made clear by this metaphor: to open up	113.25	109.4356689453125	9.75	408.8565673828125	37
the working procedures not immediately visible to those not directly involved in order to	113.25	125.1856689453125	9.75	411.05987548828125	37
demonstrate the good working of an institution.	113.25	140.1856689453125	9.75	202.49160766601562	37
Adapted to political systems, transparency is a feature in the relationship between ruler and	113.25	171.6856689453125	9.75	409.25103759765625	38
ruled, namely by granting “that the operation of the government is sufficiently open to public	113.25	186.6856689453125	9.75	409.9063720703125	38
view and simple enough in its essentials that citizens can readily understand how and what it	113.25	202.4356689453125	9.75	410.81170654296875	38
is doing” (Dahl 1998: 126). Given these attributes, transparency is usually used along the	113.25	218.1856689453125	9.75	408.46356201171875	38
same lines as openness and frequently linked to simplicity and comprehensibility. Openness	113.25	233.1856689453125	9.75	410.123779296875	38
and transparency can also be viewed as slightly different concepts (see Larsson 1998: 40),	113.25	248.9356689453125	9.75	409.85223388671875	38
but they are usually equaled since they both refer to a certain quality. So “openness and	113.25	264.6856689453125	9.75	408.45751953125	38
transparency is clearly one and the same thing (…), the activity of lifting the veil of secrecy.”	113.25	279.6856689453125	9.75	409.48858642578125	38
(Davis 1998: 121). Transparency and/or openness are seen as a prerequisite for modern	113.25	295.4356689453125	9.75	411.087890625	38
policy-making by adding the distinctive flavor of democratic legitimacy.	113.25	311.1856689453125	9.75	303.04425048828125	38
2.2. Transparency and openness as tools for democratic legitimacy	113.25	345.5213928222656	12.0	380.257568359375	39
When talking about democracy, one should bear in mind the distinction between ideal	113.25	378.6856689453125	9.75	408.51513671875	40
democracy and actual democracy as Robert Dahl (1998: 26) has rightly observed. The first	113.25	394.4356689453125	9.75	409.60906982421875	40
provides us with requirements and goals of democracy. The second offers empirical	113.25	410.1856689453125	9.75	411.078369140625	40
evidence given the restrictions of the real world. The latter can then be measured against	113.25	425.1856689453125	9.75	409.36529541015625	40
normative demands. Differentiating between these two perspectives may be crucial to	113.25	440.9356689453125	9.75	411.0596923828125	40
assess if the assumed democratic tools are suitable to achieve democratic aims and to place	113.25	456.6856689453125	9.75	409.85009765625	40
them in the entirety of democratic practices. A given number of people eager to decide on a	113.25	471.6856689453125	9.75	409.6666259765625	40
certain type of polity may have a mixture of diffuse ideas and hopes as well as practical	113.25	487.4356689453125	9.75	409.05767822265625	40
considerations of the future polity in mind. Modern large scale democracies have to develop	113.25	503.1856689453125	9.75	409.1385498046875	40
institutional arrangements to satisfy democratic criteria, namely effective participation,	113.25	518.1856689453125	9.75	410.99334716796875	40
control of the agenda, voting equality, full inclusion, and enlightened understanding (Dahl	113.25	533.9356689453125	9.75	408.5172119140625	40
1998: 85).	113.25	549.6856689453125	9.75	42.91053771972656	40
In the course of legitimizing the emerging EU polity, transparency has been a prominent	113.25	580.4356689453125	9.75	411.027587890625	41
catchword designated to stand as one of the principles capable of rendering the European	113.25	596.1856689453125	9.75	408.652099609375	41
Union more democratic. Interesting enough, the debate over transparency has mainly been	113.25	611.9356689453125	9.75	408.7451171875	41
inspired by practical steps whereas “democratic theory has very little to say in this field”	113.25	626.9356689453125	9.75	408.58636474609375	41
(Larson 1998: 40). Transparency and openness are in general linked to individual rights as	113.25	642.6856689453125	9.75	409.420166015625	41
e.g. freedom of speech, freedom of press, or the right to vote, but the principles are not at	113.25	658.4356689453125	9.75	409.64752197265625	41
the very heart of democratic theory. However, “classical and contemporary theories of	113.25	673.4356689453125	9.75	411.03094482421875	41
democracy are posited on the belief that secrecy menaces democracy, follows philosophy of	113.25	689.1856689453125	9.75	409.4583740234375	41
a totalitarian state” (Curtin 1998: 107). Opening up the legislative and executive procedures	113.25	704.9356689453125	9.75	409.5635986328125	41
is an essential for democratic policy making. Subsequently, what people learn by using these	113.25	719.9356689453125	9.75	409.9442138671875	41
open and comprehensible channels may help them in participating in policy making. It is in	113.25	735.6856689453125	9.75	409.05914306640625	41
4 — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — I H S	71.25	38.20355224609375	9.54473876953125	256.7509765625	42
this sense one means to achieve legitimacy according to a modern understanding of	71.25	109.4356689453125	9.75	411.03948974609375	43
democracy in a bundle of mechanisms. Transparency and openness are instruments to	71.25	125.1856689453125	9.75	411.013427734375	43
satisfy democratic criteria, especially the ability for citizens to participate in governance and	71.25	140.1856689453125	9.75	409.2032470703125	43
to hold leaders accountable.	71.25	155.9356689453125	9.75	122.27174377441406	43
Different ideal models of democracy highlight different democratic qualities inherent in	71.25	186.6856689453125	9.75	411.04034423828125	44
transparency and openness. Traditional representative democracy mainly stresses that	71.25	202.4356689453125	9.75	411.0215759277344	44
transparency allows and simplifies accountability and control of rulership. This is well	71.25	218.1856689453125	9.75	411.01470947265625	44
illustrated by describing transparency as follows: “[t]hus it must not be so complexly	71.25	233.1856689453125	9.75	410.9542541503906	44
constructed that citizens can readily understand how and, because they do not understand	71.25	248.9356689453125	9.75	408.9286804199219	44
their government, cannot readily hold their leaders accountable, particularly at elections”	71.25	264.6856689453125	9.75	411.0350646972656	44
(Dahl 1998: 126). The basic idea is that power corrupts. Those equipped with the means for	71.25	279.6856689453125	9.75	409.790771484375	44
leadership should therefore be observed and scrutinized. Control is necessary in democratic	71.25	295.4356689453125	9.75	409.857666015625	44
systems and “essentially about preventing abuses by those we have chosen to govern us”	71.25	311.1856689453125	9.75	408.6947326660156	44
(Verhoeven 2000: 2).	71.25	326.1856689453125	9.75	87.99528503417969	44
Participatory and deliberative approaches offer a slightly different perspective by assuming	71.25	357.6856689453125	9.75	408.4159240722656	45
that transparency and openness promote a vivid civil society. “The reason why information	71.25	372.6856689453125	9.75	408.4842224121094	45
should be open and accessible in any democracy worthy of its name is to enable political	71.25	388.4356689453125	9.75	409.4666748046875	45
participation by citizens” (Curtin 1998: 110). This approach obliges the political elites to grant	71.25	404.1856689453125	9.75	410.2676696777344	45
openness in order “to create channels for the people enabling them to participate in the work	71.25	419.1856689453125	9.75	410.25506591796875	45
of the government” (Larsson 1998: 41). A democratic government has to be based on public	71.25	434.9356689453125	9.75	410.29949951171875	45
deliberation and has to dissociate from the idea of policy-making in closed circles. Access	71.25	450.6856689453125	9.75	409.8421630859375	45
and subsequently participation are in this line of thinking crucial, taking it for granted that	71.25	465.6856689453125	9.75	409.164306640625	45
“openness in government cannot be limited to forms of parliamentary control but must	71.25	481.4356689453125	9.75	411.02923583984375	45
include a wide range of mechanisms enabling participation of citizens in the policy process	71.25	497.1856689453125	9.75	409.677490234375	45
by means of an effective access to the process and voice within it” (Verhoeven 2000:5).	71.25	512.1856689453125	9.75	374.3486328125	45
Both approaches basically rely on access to information as a tool to achieve transparency	71.25	543.6856689453125	9.75	409.6923828125	46
and openness. Access to information plays a central role:	71.25	559.4356689453125	9.75	248.25698852539062	46
Information and the availability or accessibility of information is and remains the currency of	71.25	589.7000122070312	9.75	409.9827575683594	47
democracy. Without an adequate flow of information even ex post facto accountability of the	71.25	605.4500122070312	10.23565673828125	409.8230895996094	47
governors to the people is meaningless. It is regarded as essential to the democratic process	71.25	620.4500122070312	9.75	410.5516662597656	47
that individuals are able to understand the decision-making process and the means by which	71.25	636.2000122070312	9.75	409.7164306640625	47
the decision-makers have reached their conclusions in order to effectively evaluate	71.25	651.9500122070312	9.75	411.03021240234375	47
government policies and actions and to be able to choose their representatives intelligently.	71.25	666.9500122070312	9.75	409.80560302734375	47
An equally important objective of openness in democratic government is to enhance public	71.25	682.7000122070312	9.75	409.5660095214844	47
confidence in the government (Curtin 1998: 107).	71.25	698.4500122070312	9.75	210.13424682617188	47
Apart from these two approaches that heavily rely on democratic justifications, a third can be	71.25	729.6856689453125	9.75	409.62518310546875	48
identified. It is rather concerned with the restrictions to transparency due to conflicting	71.25	745.4356689453125	9.75	411.0089111328125	48
I H S — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — 5	267.75	38.20355224609375	9.54473876953125	256.2540283203125	49
values, namely efficiency. “Although it is certainly important that the public have access to	113.25	109.4356689453125	9.75	408.93511962890625	50
relevant information about administration, working in a goldfish bowl can rarely be as	113.25	125.1856689453125	9.75	411.0675048828125	50
efficient as working in private” (Peters 1995: 297). The basic assumption stresses that policy-	113.25	140.1856689453125	9.75	411.24676513671875	50
making is mainly about positive outcomes for a given population. Too much openness may	113.25	155.9356689453125	9.75	409.7139892578125	50
hamper negotiations and may “lead to attitudes of legalism and risk aversion” (Verhoeven	113.25	171.6856689453125	9.75	411.08453369140625	50
2000: 2). This view focuses on the bargaining character of policy-making. The very character	113.25	186.6856689453125	9.75	409.9617919921875	50
of political trade-offs makes it necessary to withhold information for some time. In order to	113.25	202.4356689453125	9.75	408.78533935546875	50
achieve the best possible outcome, information can be used when appropriate in the	113.25	218.1856689453125	9.75	411.0555419921875	50
deliberative processes. So openness as legitimizing positive quality is weakening efficiency	113.25	233.1856689453125	9.75	411.0137939453125	50
as a legitimizing quality.	113.25	248.9356689453125	9.75	104.22984313964844	50
Even if efficiency is not given priority over transparency, openness is never an absolute	113.25	279.6856689453125	9.75	411.0966796875	51
category in the actual shaping of political systems. Actual democratic practice has to take	113.25	295.4356689453125	9.75	408.8631591796875	51
into account that there may be other conflicting values, e.g. the right to privacy of individuals.	113.25	311.1856689453125	9.75	410.38983154296875	51
Moreover, different political systems have created different degrees of openness over time.	113.25	326.1856689453125	9.75	409.10211181640625	51
The variety of diverse regulations in the 15 EU Member States illustrates that a broad	113.25	341.9356689453125	9.75	411.0699462890625	51
spectrum of actual regulations within both democratic and efficient political systems is	113.25	357.6856689453125	9.75	410.97393798828125	51
possible. Transparency and openness are neither a dependent nor an independent variable,	113.25	372.6856689453125	9.75	409.5992431640625	51
“[a] certain type of government and a certain type of institutional arrangement will produce a	113.25	388.4356689453125	9.75	410.4210205078125	51
certain type of openness on the one hand, but on the other hand a certain type of openness	113.25	404.1856689453125	9.75	410.18402099609375	51
will affect the institutional setting” (Larsson 1998: 44).	113.25	419.1856689453125	9.75	231.0150146484375	51
3. Transparency and openness in the European Union	113.25	463.231201171875	15.75	406.45074462890625	52
Neither democracy nor transparency was on the agenda of the early European Community	113.25	500.1856689453125	9.75	409.8194580078125	53
for Coal and Steal. As Carvel puts it, the “EEC were a benevolent conspiracy by the elites of	113.25	515.9356689453125	9.75	409.59161376953125	53
Europe to bind their peoples and stop another war” (Carvel 1998: 56). Cooperation between	113.25	531.6856689453125	9.75	408.974609375	53
European nation states resembled an international regime with diplomatic negotiations	113.25	546.6856689453125	9.75	411.02154541015625	53
prevailing. However, things changed with the growing communitarization of European	113.25	562.4356689453125	9.75	411.106689453125	53
policies. The shift in power relations and the evolvement of a new style of policy-making with	113.25	578.1856689453125	9.75	410.25079345703125	53
intermingling national and supranational levels cast shadow on usual ways how to handle	113.25	593.1856689453125	9.75	408.36016845703125	53
EU politics. Democratic and transparent decision-making would have been an alienated idea	113.25	608.9356689453125	9.75	409.6270751953125	53
in diplomatic interaction but was seen as an adequate answer to the increase in popular	113.25	624.6856689453125	9.75	411.03717041015625	53
discontent over the development of the European Union.	113.25	639.6856689453125	9.75	240.88113403320312	53
The growing discrepancies due to the changes in policy making showed up in many areas	113.25	671.1856689453125	9.75	409.5430908203125	54
and were also highlighted with regard to access to information. In September 1992 the Dutch	113.25	686.9356689453125	9.75	409.60308837890625	54
Member of Parliament, Alman Metten, asked a Dutch ministry to hand over documents	113.25	701.9356689453125	9.75	408.40966796875	54
concerning various ECOFIN-meetings which he considered important for his parliamentary	113.25	717.6856689453125	9.75	408.8800048828125	54
work. He referred to the Dutch law granting openness and argued that “Council deliberations	113.25	733.4356689453125	9.75	410.0093994140625	54
6 — Cornelia Moser / How open is ‘open as possible’? — I H S	71.25	38.20355224609375	9.54473876953125	256.7509765625	55
and decisions (...) should be subject to the law on openness, otherwise a growing area of	71.25	109.4356689453125	9.75	409.03369140625	56
formerly transparent policy and decision-making will be brought out of reach of the law of	71.25	125.1856689453125	9.75	408.5063781738281	56
openness as well as that of democratic control.” (Metten 1998: 86f) After lengthy	71.25	140.1856689453125	9.75	411.0306701660156	56
deliberations the Netherlands finally refused in 1995 to release the documents stating that	71.25	155.9356689453125	9.75	409.3210754394531	56
the Community’s concerns and needs were in this case prior to national law.	71.25	171.6856689453125	9.75	328.5555114746094	56
Issues of legitimacy had long been up to the single Member State, but it seemed to become	71.25	202.4356689453125	9.75	409.5601806640625	57
increasingly important to include related commitments and provisions in the acquis	71.25	218.1856689453125	9.75	411.0208740234375	57
communitaire. Transparency and Openness came first on the agenda in the early 1990s. On	71.25	233.1856689453125	9.75	409.43505859375	57
15 December 1991 declaration No. 17 attached to the Maastricht Treaty confirmed, “the	71.25	248.9356689453125	9.75	411.0425720214844	57
Conference considers that transparency of the decision-making process strengthens the	71.25	264.6856689453125	9.75	410.9842224121094	57
democratic nature of the institutions and the public’s confidence in the administration” (cit. a.	71.25	279.6856689453125	9.75	410.1831359863281	57
Lodge 1994: 349). Transparency was used as a handy answer to rising popular concern of	71.25	295.4356689453125	9.75	408.88201904296875	57
what was going on at the European level. Given the qualities of transparency, one can only	71.25	311.1856689453125	9.75	409.79669189453125	57
admire the audacity to put transparency on the EU agenda ever. Decision-making had by	71.25	326.1856689453125	9.75	410.021240234375	57
then already gained increased impact and complexity. To render the EU decision-making	71.25	341.9356689453125	9.75	410.98724365234375	57
process open, simple and therefore understandable seems a rather risky goal.	71.25	357.6856689453125	9.75	337.5343322753906	57
Nevertheless, this presumed remedy of the so called ‘democratic deficit’ was particularly	71.25	388.4356689453125	9.75	408.58013916015625	58
promoted by the Member States which did not want to trouble themselves to discuss the	71.25	404.1856689453125	9.75	408.4604797363281	58
practices of the Council and the implications of a substantial shift in decision making away	71.25	419.1856689453125	9.75	409.7054443359375	58
from the national level. The addressee was first of all the Commission, which was frequently	71.25	434.9356689453125	9.75	410.01300048828125	58
referred to as “byzantine, inaccessible and an affront to the conduct of democratic politics”	71.25	450.6856689453125	9.75	409.7807312011719	58
(see Lodge 1994: 345). Attacking the Commission and calling for more openness had	71.25	465.6856689453125	9.75	411.0403747558594	58
unintended consequences. Involuntarily, the discussion and subsequent measures to	71.25	481.4356689453125	9.75	411.03521728515625	58
enhance transparency and openness brought into light again the rather obscure procedures	71.25	497.1856689453125	9.75	410.349365234375	58
of the Council’s internal working and decision-making.	71.25	512.1856689453125	9.75	232.44796752929688	58
When France almost rejected the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty in its 1992 referendum	71.25	543.6856689453125	9.75	410.01373291015625	59
and the Danes also refused to give consent in the first referendum, increasing concern	71.25	559.4356689453125	9.75	411.06549072265625	59
focused on the people’s interest in the project “European Union.” Along with frequent	71.25	574.4356689453125	9.75	411.0640563964844	59
reference to democracy and subsidiarity as adequate tools to meet the people’s demands,	71.25	590.1856689453125	9.75	409.4604187011719	59
the notion of transparency was introduced. A firmly declaration stressed the aim to create „an	71.25	605.9356689453125	9.75	410.7188415527344	59
ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as openly as	71.25	620.9356689453125	9.75	409.7407531738281	59
possible and as closely as possible to the citizen” (Article 1 (A) TEU). Transparency was	71.25	636.6856689453125	9.75	409.194580078125	59
subsequently transposed into the specific instrument of access to documents with Article 255	71.25	652.4356689453125	9.75	410.5978088378906	59
(191a) saying that	71.25	667.4356689453125	9.75	77.33549499511719	59

procedure referred to in Article 251 within two years of the entry into force of the Treaty of	113.25	139.70001220703125	9.75	409.58123779296875	62

provisions regarding access to its documents.	113.25	201.95001220703125	9.75	199.38177490234375	63
The distinctive status of the Council was acknowledged in Article 207 leaving it up to its will	113.25	233.1856689453125	9.75	410.01531982421875	64
to decide whether documents touched its role as legislator or not. Article 207 (151) specified	113.25	248.9356689453125	9.75	409.525634765625	64
for the Council that	113.25	264.6856689453125	9.75	81.80584716796875	64
4. The Council shall adopt its Rules of Procedure. For the purpose of applying Article 255(3),	113.25	294.95001220703125	9.75	410.4481201171875	65
the Council shall elaborate in these Rules the conditions under which the public shall have	113.25	310.70001220703125	9.75	408.9705810546875	65
access to Council documents. For the purpose of this paragraph, the Council shall define the	113.25	326.45001220703125	9.75	409.7587890625	65
cases in which it is to be regarded as acting in its legislative capacity, with a view to allowing	113.25	341.45001220703125	9.75	409.7156982421875	65
greater access to documents in those cases, while at the same time preserving the	113.25	357.20001220703125	9.75	410.9981689453125	65
effectiveness of its decision making process. In any event, when the Council acts in its	113.25	372.95001220703125	9.75	410.75	65
legislative capacity, the results of votes and explanations of vote as well as statements in the	113.25	387.95001220703125	9.75	409.7977294921875	65
minutes shall be made public.	113.25	403.70001220703125	9.75	131.18341064453125	65
The introduction of the right to information in the context of internal rules of procedure has	113.25	434.9356689453125	9.75	409.4713134765625	66
provoked critical remarks (see e.g. Curtin 1998:112). The Dutch government, which regarded	113.25	450.6856689453125	9.75	409.370849609375	66
the right to information as a fundamental right, lodged a plea with the European Court of	113.25	466.4356689453125	9.75	411.07904052734375	66
Justice (Case 58/94), but was eventually repudiated. It was therefore up to the body’s	113.25	481.4356689453125	9.75	411.054443359375	66
internal code of conduct how to shape transparency.	113.25	497.1856689453125	9.75	225.784423828125	66
Following the Treaty’s obligations, the different EU bodies made up their own regulations on	113.25	528.6856689453125	9.75	409.1878662109375	67
access to documents. The Council adopted a code of conduct concerning public access to	113.25	543.6856689453125	9.75	409.01593017578125	67
Council and Commission documents in December 1993, which was adopted by the	113.25	559.4356689453125	9.75	411.05853271484375	67
Commission in February 1994. The European Parliament implemented a similar system in	113.25	575.1856689453125	9.75	408.529541015625	67
1997. Moreover, the Treaty of Amsterdam fixed that a regulation on access to documents of	113.25	590.1856689453125	9.75	409.3082275390625	67
all three bodies should be adopted under the codecision procedure within two years of entry	113.25	605.9356689453125	9.75	410.39337158203125	67
into force of the Amsterdam Treaty.	113.25	621.6856689453125	9.75	151.6912841796875	67
None of the bodies has committed itself to absolute transparency. The Commission’s and the	113.25	652.4356689453125	9.75	409.73681640625	68
Council’s code of conduct listed several exceptions including public interest, individual	113.25	668.1856689453125	9.75	411.19378662109375	68
privacy, commercial and industrial secrecy as well as the Community’s financial interests.	113.25	683.1856689453125	9.75	409.1195068359375	68
Access to documents was likewise denied if requested by the supplier, were it a Member	113.25	698.9356689453125	9.75	408.57110595703125	68
State or another third party. Documents also remained confidential if the EU-body claimed an	113.25	714.6856689453125	9.75	410.0247802734375	68
interest in the confidentiality of the proceedings. The European Parliament decided to refuse	113.25	729.6856689453125	9.75	409.26043701171875	68
access to documents of certain parliamentary meetings in order to protect the confidentiality	113.25	745.4356689453125	9.75	410.07257080078125	68

of deliberations of political groups. The rather narrow definition of the Commission and the	71.25	109.4356689453125	9.75	408.92333984375	70
Council has been challenged on various occasions. The subsequent judgments of the	71.25	125.1856689453125	9.75	411.0536804199219	70
European Courts and the investigations of the European Ombudsman can be regarded as	71.25	140.1856689453125	9.75	409.1233215332031	70
an invitation to reconsider the practice of the institutions.	71.25	155.9356689453125	9.75	244.4547119140625	70
Most of the refusals to grant access referred to the confidentiality of the proceedings. In	71.25	186.6856689453125	9.75	411.0364074707031	71

concerning Justice and Agricultural Councils without success. The decision of the Court of	71.25	218.1856689453125	9.75	409.1899108886719	71
First Instance turned the Council’s position down and ordered the release of these	71.25	233.1856689453125	9.75	411.0517578125	71
documents. Moreover, it stressed the necessity of an accurate balancing test guaranteeing	71.25	248.9356689453125	9.75	408.767822265625	71
that the interest of citizens to get hold of documents should be carefully examined against	71.25	264.6856689453125	9.75	409.771240234375	71
the needs of internal proceedings. The same idea was expressed in WWF UK versus	71.25	279.6856689453125	9.75	411.0495910644531	71
Commission (Case T–105/95). The Court conceded that certain documents out of a bundle	71.25	295.4356689453125	9.75	408.9476013183594	71
might be withhold but that those which failed the balancing test should be handed over to the	71.25	311.1856689453125	9.75	409.8608703613281	71
applicant. The discrepancies between Member State’s practice and the Council’s position	71.25	326.1856689453125	9.75	411.00872802734375	71
were again highlighted when Swedish journalists demanded documents relating to Europol.	71.25	341.9356689453125	9.75	409.3526916503906	71
Sweden handed over 18 out of 20 documents, the Council only 4. The Swedish journalists	71.25	357.6856689453125	9.75	409.6929931640625	71
lodged a plea before the Council of First Instance (Svenska Journalistförbundet versus	71.25	372.6856689453125	9.75	411.0898742675781	71
Council, T–174/95) and the Court finally annulled the Council’s decision for not sufficiently	71.25	388.4356689453125	9.75	409.17486572265625	71
reasoning the refusal. Generally, the judgments of the European Court suggest a careful	71.25	404.1856689453125	9.75	408.742431640625	71
examination of requests on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the Court has frequently taken	71.25	419.1856689453125	9.75	409.1845703125	71
the side of applicants who were denied access to documents by the EU institutions. Its	71.25	434.9356689453125	9.75	408.73724365234375	71
judgments therefore have “broadened the scope of access rights” (Verhoeven 2000: 9).	71.25	450.6856689453125	9.75	371.37225341796875	71
Another way to reassess the interpretations of the rules of conduct is by complaining to the	71.25	481.4356689453125	9.75	409.26849365234375	72
European Ombudsman. He has been installed to serve as an intermediary between single	71.25	497.1856689453125	9.75	408.52386474609375	72
citizens and the European Union. Transparency and access to information is one of the	71.25	512.1856689453125	9.75	411.0598449707031	72
major tasks of the Ombudsman. His own-initiated inquiry aimed to close the loophole in	71.25	527.9356689453125	9.75	408.3934020996094	72
Article 255, which covers only the Commission, the Council, and the European Parliament.	71.25	543.6856689453125	9.75	409.5726318359375	72
The Ombudsman’s inquiry included 15 EU institutions and bodies and suggested	71.25	558.6856689453125	9.75	411.0142517089844	72
improvements regarding access to documents. Although his inquiries lack the virtue of law	71.25	574.4356689453125	9.75	408.6735534667969	72
the conclusions of the Ombudsman have some impact given the very nature of the office.	71.25	590.1856689453125	9.75	409.17950439453125	72
Complaints to the Ombudsman on transparency concern most of all the infringement	71.25	605.1856689453125	9.75	411.0226135253906	72
procedure, recruitment procedures and access to documents (see Söderman 2000). The	71.25	620.9356689453125	9.75	411.0437316894531	72
Ombudsman was also used to defy the Council’s restrictive dealing with documents	71.25	636.6856689453125	9.75	411.0201721191406	72
concerning the Third Pillar. Frequent requests on documents made by a British Journalist on	71.25	651.6856689453125	9.75	409.5421142578125	72
behalf of the human rights organization “StateWatch” had frequently been refused.	71.25	667.4356689453125	9.75	353.31591796875	72
Since the emergence of the transparency theme access to information on EU politics has	71.25	698.9356689453125	9.75	409.2897033691406	73
substantially improved. Thanks to the use of electronic media, the lack of information on the	71.25	713.9356689453125	9.75	409.347900390625	73
EU bodies and their working has been enormously reduced. Many bodies and institutions	71.25	729.6856689453125	9.75	409.0714111328125	73
nowadays offer registers of documents. Press releases, minutes and previews of the agenda	71.25	745.4356689453125	9.75	411.1709899902344	73

are readily available. However, comprehensive information on the working of the EU at large	113.25	109.4356689453125	9.75	409.03662109375	75
or thematic information sheets rather highlight the service-orientated character of an	113.25	125.1856689453125	9.75	411.07415771484375	75

transparency. Likewise, the very idea of broadcasting Council meetings may promote the	113.25	155.9356689453125	9.75	411.0390625	75
understanding of EU policy-making, the actual programs are rather uninformative and	113.25	171.6856689453125	9.75	411.0848388671875	75
moreover, “flavored with propaganda” (Guggenbühl 1998: 24). “Enlightened understanding”	113.25	186.6856689453125	9.75	411.09173583984375	75
as a democratic criteria channeled through the intermediaries of an active civil society will	113.25	202.4356689453125	9.75	409.26507568359375	75
not be achieved by this means.	113.25	218.1856689453125	9.75	135.03285217285156	75
4. Transparency and openness in comparison	113.25	261.481201171875	15.75	346.4248352050781	76
The debate on the new regulation regarding public access to European Parliament, Council	113.25	299.1856689453125	9.75	410.24884033203125	77
and Commission documents gave the opportunity to analyze the current positions of the	113.25	314.1856689453125	9.75	411.029296875	77
three EU-bodies with regard to transparency and openness. The comparison works on the	113.25	329.9356689453125	9.75	408.6181640625	77
assumption that access to information strengthens democratic legitimacy. If everybody has	113.25	345.6856689453125	9.75	409.9996337890625	77
access to each single document drawn up in the public administration as well as to those	113.25	360.6856689453125	9.75	408.7938232421875	77
documents worked out during legislative policy-making, transparency and openness are	113.25	376.4356689453125	9.75	411.03271484375	77
maximized. Criteria for assessing the differences and similarities between the positions of	113.25	392.1856689453125	9.75	408.77276611328125	77
the EU-bodies are the question of who has access to what documents under which	113.25	407.1856689453125	9.75	411.035888671875	77
conditions. However, the very nature of the EU polity causes scenarios, which go beyond the	113.25	422.9356689453125	9.75	409.6082763671875	77
scope of the analysis. Since legislation on access to information vary among the Member	113.25	438.6856689453125	9.75	409.2362060546875	77
States, an upgrading of access on the EU-level might override provisions on the national	113.25	453.6856689453125	9.75	409.19842529296875	77
level. Extensive access to documents on grounds of the new regulation could then lead to an	113.25	469.4356689453125	9.75	409.6907958984375	77
upgrading of transparency in some Member States while at the same time weakening the	113.25	485.1856689453125	9.75	408.74871826171875	77
right to information in others, namely the Nordic countries. The question of how to deal with	113.25	500.1856689453125	9.75	409.2197265625	77
the so-called “Third party”-documents, which includes those of Member States, will be	113.25	515.9356689453125	9.75	410.992919921875	77
therefore touched, too.	113.25	531.6856689453125	9.75	97.55549621582031	77
Transparency and openness by means of access to information are frequently linked to	113.25	562.4356689453125	9.75	411.0311279296875	78
accountability and participation but actual democratic practice illustrates that access to	113.25	578.1856689453125	9.75	410.9527587890625	78
documents is always limited in one way or the other. Yet, not only the institutional	113.25	593.1856689453125	9.75	411.00213623046875	78
arrangement but also the nature of the institutions itself is shaping the degree of openness	113.25	608.9356689453125	9.75	409.64251708984375	78
and transparency. Along the lines of how much transparency may possibly be granted, the	113.25	624.6856689453125	9.75	408.88641357421875	78
institutional view will define how access is granted under which conditions, what kind of	113.25	639.6856689453125	9.75	408.83551025390625	78
information is accessible and why access is granted or denied. The institution’s culture, its	113.25	655.4356689453125	9.75	409.646728515625	78
self-perception, and its inherent institutional targets will influence the degree of openness,	113.25	671.1856689453125	9.75	408.96954345703125	78
which is consequently defended against conflicting and concurrent positions.	113.25	686.1856689453125	9.75	331.4840087890625	78

In accordance with the EC-Treaty obligations Article 251(2) and 255(2) the Commission	71.25	155.9356689453125	9.75	411.052490234375	81
issued a proposal for public access to documents of the Council, the Commission and the	71.25	171.6856689453125	9.75	409.48089599609375	81
European Parliament. The Commission proposal (COM (2000) 30 final/2) of 21 February	71.25	186.6856689453125	9.75	411.0930480957031	81
2000 was forwarded to both Parliament and Council.	71.25	202.4356689453125	9.75	225.083251953125	81
The European Parliament primarily dealt with the new regulation in several meetings of the	71.25	233.1856689453125	9.75	408.7710876464844	82
Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which considered	71.25	248.9356689453125	9.75	408.84100341796875	82
opinions of other committees, too. The Committee adopted its draft legislative resolution on	71.25	264.6856689453125	9.75	408.9560852050781	82
24 October 2000 by 28 votes to 4, with 2 abstentions and made it available to the public	71.25	279.6856689453125	9.75	411.0533447265625	82
(Doc. No. A5–0318/2000). This draft would have been subject to the vote in plenary session,	71.25	295.4356689453125	9.75	410.15850830078125	82
which was eventually postponed in order to open up informal meetings with both	71.25	311.1856689453125	9.75	411.0743103027344	82
Commission and Council.	71.25	326.1856689453125	9.75	111.00498962402344	82
Somewhat different and highly indicative is the proceeding in the Council, which dealt with	71.25	357.6856689453125	9.75	409.1434631347656	83
the regulation in various sessions of the COREPER working group on information under	71.25	372.6856689453125	9.75	411.0796813964844	83
subsequent the Portuguese, the French and the Swedish presidency. Common positions are	71.25	388.4356689453125	9.75	409.4079895019531	83
much more difficult to find since the positions of each of the 15 Member States has to be	71.25	404.1856689453125	9.75	409.0332946777344	83
considered. Access to documents is subject to a wide range of implementation forms in	71.25	419.1856689453125	9.75	411.0006103515625	83
respective national legislation. Differences with regard to Member States legislation cover	71.25	434.9356689453125	9.75	411.05419921875	83
the whole range between narrow definitions of openness and a very extensive practice in	71.25	450.6856689453125	9.75	408.4095764160156	83
granting access to documents. A review of national legislations shows that e.g. Great Britain	71.25	465.6856689453125	9.75	409.46722412109375	83
makes extensive use of the so-called secrecy act thus withdrawing official documents from	71.25	481.4356689453125	9.75	409.696044921875	83
public scrutiny. On the opposite, the Nordic countries have long times practiced the open	71.25	497.1856689453125	9.75	408.5111389160156	83
government approach. The adoption of a common position at the General Affairs Committee	71.25	512.1856689453125	9.75	409.1168518066406	83
meeting was tabled for the end of November, then postponed to January 2001. The Swedish	71.25	527.9356689453125	9.75	409.3118896484375	83
Presidency’s working paper of that meeting which is the basis for comparison still reflects	71.25	543.6856689453125	9.75	409.3446960449219	83
internally unsettled issues.	71.25	558.6856689453125	9.75	116.19973754882812	83
The obvious difficulties to find a compromise provoked a substantial delay in the adoption of	71.25	590.1856689453125	9.75	409.2248229980469	84
the new legislation. A series of informal “trilogue meetings” started at the end of January	71.25	605.9356689453125	9.75	409.13232421875	84
2001 and was concluded with a compromise. The regulation was finally adopted on 30 May	71.25	620.9356689453125	9.75	409.86187744140625	84
2001 (Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001).	71.25	636.6856689453125	9.75	164.36993408203125	84
The Commission’s proposal stresses in its recitals the necessity to broaden transparency	71.25	667.4356689453125	9.75	409.09967041015625	85
and openness, thus enabling “citizens to participate more closely in the decision-making	71.25	683.1856689453125	9.75	410.98724365234375	85
process, and guarantees that the administration enjoys greater legitimacy and is more	71.25	698.9356689453125	9.75	411.0071716308594	85
effective and more accountable vis-à-vis the citizen in a democratic system” (Comm, recital	71.25	713.9356689453125	9.75	410.9644470214844	85
2). It reaffirms this commitment by reminding of the European Councils of Birmingham,	71.25	729.6856689453125	9.75	411.03631591796875	85
Edinburgh and Copenhagen, which extensively dealt with transparency. The prime	71.25	745.4356689453125	9.75	411.0787353515625	85

addressee of the regulation is therefore “the citizen.” Despite this commitment, the making of	113.25	109.4356689453125	9.75	410.08013916015625	87
the Commission’s proposal has provoked criticism for not involving representatives of civil	113.25	125.1856689453125	9.75	408.76861572265625	87
society. The European Committee of the British House of Lords judged that “[a]n important	113.25	140.1856689453125	9.75	409.542724609375	87
political opportunity was missed. Extensive external consultation would have demonstrated	113.25	155.9356689453125	9.75	409.248291015625	87
commitment to openness. It might have gone some way to restore to the institution some of	113.25	171.6856689453125	9.75	409.4239501953125	87
the legitimacy and credibility it lost with the collapse of the Santer Commission.”1 However,	113.25	183.68621826171875	12.74945068359375	410.99078369140625	87
the draft confirms the will to shape the European Union as a democratic system. The	113.25	202.4356689453125	9.75	411.0189208984375	87
principle of openness shall guarantee civic participation and accountability.	113.25	218.1856689453125	9.75	321.0434265136719	87
Apart from the rights of Member States, the scope of the Parliament’s regulation is much	113.25	248.9356689453125	9.75	408.5123291015625	88
broader than that of the Commission. Specific rules on access only stay in force if they	113.25	264.6856689453125	9.75	408.96026611328125	88
provide more access. The parliament intends an extensive approach including remarks on	113.25	279.6856689453125	9.75	411.06396484375	88
future provisions on access to documents: “On the same basis, the present regulation is the	113.25	295.4356689453125	9.75	409.46197509765625	88
legal framework for existing and future interinstitutional agreements in relation to methods of	113.25	311.1856689453125	9.75	409.431884765625	88
drafting laws, content and format of the Official Journal, managing and storing documents	113.25	326.1856689453125	9.75	408.988525390625	88
with a view to granting access, and guidelines on the rules on modalities for access to	113.25	341.9356689453125	9.75	411.02313232421875	88
documents” (EP, recital 3).	113.25	357.6856689453125	9.75	115.47674560546875	88
With regard to the principal motivation of the regulation on access to documents this draft	113.25	388.4356689453125	9.75	409.37255859375	89
shows other focal points. The proposal makes reference to the acquis communitaire and	113.25	404.1856689453125	9.75	411.03863525390625	89
declaration 17 as well as the Charta of Fundamental Rights. It stresses in its justification to	113.25	419.1856689453125	9.75	409.71771240234375	89
recital 0 that “[a] truly democratic debate cannot develop in the European Union without open	113.25	434.9356689453125	9.75	409.6522216796875	89
institutions” and promotes the right of information. Transparency through access to	113.25	450.6856689453125	9.75	411.0250244140625	89
documents suffices another principle by granting protection “against the arbitrary use of and	113.25	465.6856689453125	9.75	409.4398193359375	89
the abuse of power and against corruption and fraud” (EP, recital 2). The draft is clearly	113.25	481.4356689453125	9.75	408.7471923828125	89
aimed at the citizen and the general public.	113.25	497.1856689453125	9.75	186.76556396484375	89
The Council’s working paper issued under Swedish presidency2 reflects a rapprochement	113.25	524.936279296875	12.7493896484375	411.04803466796875	90
between the Member States and makes some concessions to the European Parliament’s	113.25	543.6856689453125	9.75	408.994873046875	90
draft. The position of the Council diverges however from those of Commission and the	113.25	559.4356689453125	9.75	411.11016845703125	90
European Parliament. The draft confirms in its recitals the principle of openness and	113.25	574.4356689453125	9.75	410.989013671875	90
transparency as a means to achieve greater legitimacy, effectiveness and accountability. It	113.25	590.1856689453125	9.75	409.29193115234375	90
follows the Commission’s wording in saying that “[o]penness enables citizens to participate	113.25	605.9356689453125	9.75	408.9306640625	90
more closely in the decision-making process and guarantees that the administration enjoys	113.25	620.9356689453125	9.75	409.9852294921875	90
greater legitimacy and is more effective and more accountable to the citizen in a democratic	113.25	636.6856689453125	9.75	410.083740234375	90
system” (Council, recital 2). The aim is “to widen access to documents as far as possible”	113.25	652.4356689453125	9.75	408.92974853515625	90

(Council, recital 4). However, the Council makes special reference to Article 255(3) in	71.25	109.4356689453125	9.75	411.0372009277344	94
proclaiming that Council’s documents concerning legislative issues should be more	71.25	125.1856689453125	9.75	411.01263427734375	94
accessible “while at the same time preserving the effectiveness of their decision-making	71.25	140.1856689453125	9.75	410.98724365234375	94
process” (Council, recital 6).	71.25	155.9356689453125	9.75	122.25013732910156	94
4.2. Transparency in perspective	71.25	190.2713623046875	12.0	184.48919677734375	95
Getting information is a way of empowerment in terms of democratic citizenship. Access to	71.25	224.1856689453125	9.75	409.117431640625	96
documents therefore centers on the question how much access is granted. This includes	71.25	239.1856689453125	9.75	408.94073486328125	96
definitions of those who benefit as well as procedures on access. Another important criterion	71.25	254.9356689453125	9.75	410.0376892089844	96
is the scope of access. The accessibility of documents refers both to the stage in the policy-	71.25	270.6856689453125	9.75	411.24676513671875	96
making cycle as well as to policy fields. A rather special case due to the nature of the	71.25	285.6856689453125	9.75	411.0011901855469	96
European Union has to be considered, too. The multi-level system offers multiple points of	71.25	301.4356689453125	9.75	409.1628723144531	96
access, notably the EU-institutions and the Member States. The question of how to deal	71.25	317.1856689453125	9.75	408.9796447753906	96
judicially with this configuration cannot be assessed in terms of more or less access since	71.25	332.1856689453125	9.75	408.9792175292969	96
national provisions vary. Whether Member States have the final say in the disclosure of	71.25	347.9356689453125	9.75	411.03857421875	96
documents originating from a nation state or not rather touches the question of weakening	71.25	363.6856689453125	9.75	408.6847839355469	96
the Member States or strengthening the European Union’s impact.	71.25	378.6856689453125	9.75	287.2720642089844	96
4.2.1. Beneficiaries of the regulation	71.25	415.59552001953125	9.75	171.70724487304688	97
The provision on who should be entitled to access shows little divergences. Beneficiaries	71.25	446.9356689453125	9.75	408.8504638671875	98
shall be all Union citizens, all enterprises having their office within the territory of the EU, and	71.25	462.6856689453125	9.75	409.716552734375	98
all legal residents. The Parliament’s as well as the Council’s drafts exceed this right to non-	71.25	477.6856689453125	9.75	411.24676513671875	98
EU natural or legal persons although the wording indicates that this right is not enforceable.	71.25	493.4356689453125	9.75	409.9403076171875	98
This is a slight but however important improvement towards more openness since namely	71.25	509.1856689453125	9.75	409.101806640625	98
accession states may have a strong interest to get hold of certain EU-documents. All three	71.25	524.1856689453125	9.75	410.21875	98
proposals in principle agree that no reason has to be given by the applicant as far as his	71.25	539.9356689453125	9.75	409.3436584472656	98
specific interest is concerned. However, only the European Parliament’s position is without	71.25	555.6856689453125	9.75	409.3343811035156	98
reservation: “The institution concerned may ask the applicant for further details regarding the	71.25	570.6856689453125	9.75	409.41400146484375	98
application” (Comm, par. 5.1). A similar wording is used in the Councils respective paragraph	71.25	586.4356689453125	9.75	409.51385498046875	98
(Council, par. 3A(2)). The wording of both the Commission’s and the Council’s proposal open	71.25	602.1856689453125	9.75	411.07696533203125	98
a backdoor to revise this principle, whereas the Parliament’s draft defines rather narrowly	71.25	617.1856689453125	9.75	408.8707580566406	98
that asking back is only possible “for the purposes of identifying the documents” (EP, par.	71.25	632.9356689453125	9.75	410.5018005371094	98
5.1). The European Parliament’s draft does not mention large documents or repeated	71.25	648.6856689453125	9.75	411.14007568359375	98
requests whereas both Commission and Council consider these cases and make specific	71.25	663.6856689453125	9.75	409.00439453125	98
provisions. A specific rule applies in case of large documents or repeated requests. The	71.25	679.4356689453125	9.75	411.0516357421875	98
Council follows the suggestions of the Commission saying that “[i]n the event of general and	71.25	695.1856689453125	9.75	410.0068359375	98
repetitive applications or applications relating to very large documents or a very large	71.25	710.1856689453125	9.75	411.07257080078125	98
number of documents, the institution concerned may confer with the applicant informally,	71.25	725.9356689453125	9.75	408.6566467285156	98
with a view to finding a fair solution” (Council, par. 3a(3)).	71.25	741.6856689453125	9.75	242.50726318359375	98

Speeding up the process of application is seen as a citizen-orientated approach by the	113.25	109.4356689453125	9.75	408.8087158203125	100
Parliament. Whereas the Commission sets a time limit of one month to reply to an initial	113.25	125.1856689453125	9.75	409.2071533203125	100
application, the Parliament’s approach reduces the answering time to two weeks and	113.25	140.1856689453125	9.75	411.0494384765625	100
demands to hand over at the same time the requested documents in case of a positive	113.25	155.9356689453125	9.75	411.05731201171875	100
decision (EP, par. 5.2). The Council’s draft expresses its commitment that applications “shall	113.25	171.6856689453125	9.75	410.20001220703125	100
be handled promptly” (Council, par 5.1), but leans on the Commission’s position of a	113.25	186.6856689453125	9.75	411.026123046875	100
deadline for response limited to one month.	113.25	202.4356689453125	9.75	186.0714111328125	100
As far as requests for documents are concerned, each draft foresees in its paragraph 5 a	113.25	233.1856689453125	9.75	408.61773681640625	101
fairly similar procedure. If the application is not accepted, the applicant is entitled to make a	113.25	248.9356689453125	9.75	409.415771484375	101
confirmatory request. If this request is turned down, the institution has to inform about	113.25	264.6856689453125	9.75	411.02215576171875	101
possible remedies, namely a complaint to the Ombudsman or the lodging of the complaint	113.25	279.6856689453125	9.75	409.46795654296875	101
with the European Court of Justice. The Council’s proposal foresees however that	113.25	295.4356689453125	9.75	411.08831787109375	101
“[c]onfirmatory applications for sensitive documents shall be handled only by those persons	113.25	311.1856689453125	9.75	409.65008544921875	101

rules of the institution concerned” (Council, par. 6(1)). The European Parliament takes a	113.25	341.9356689453125	9.75	409.41204833984375	101
somehow different view by demanding, “[p]arliamentary scrutiny of all documents excluded	113.25	357.6856689453125	9.75	408.454345703125	101

In its efforts to shape the regulation on access as an overall guideline on the future access to	71.25	520.4356689453125	9.75	409.7979736328125	126
information, the European Parliament’s proposal embraces the detailed handling of registers,	71.25	536.1856689453125	9.75	410.1195983886719	127
unlike the Commission’s initial draft. Although many bodies and institutions of the European	71.25	551.1856689453125	9.75	409.21563720703125	128
Union already offer registers accessible by the Internet, the European Parliament sets great	71.25	566.9356689453125	9.75	410.2940673828125	129
store of regulating this point specifically and incorporates a proactive approach to information	71.25	582.6856689453125	9.75	409.4960632324219	130
on documents. It suggests therefore the installation of a register for each institution. These	71.25	597.6856689453125	9.75	408.8788757324219	131
have to include at a minimum “all documents created by that institution in the course of a	71.25	613.4356689453125	9.75	409.1434326171875	132
procedure for the adoption of legally binding measures, notably all proposals, opinions,	71.25	629.1856689453125	9.75	411.0443420410156	133
working documents, agendas, documents for discussion at formal meetings, minutes,	71.25	644.1856689453125	9.75	410.99481201171875	134
declarations and positions of Member States” (EP, par. 9a(3)). The register has to list those	71.25	659.9356689453125	9.75	409.6336669921875	135
documents that are excluded from access indicating reasons for exclusion (EP, par. 9a(2)).	71.25	675.6856689453125	9.75	409.593505859375	136
Apart from that, these documents have to be incorporated in the public register from the	71.25	690.6856689453125	9.75	411.046875	137
moment of time a decision has been made or at the moment a document is sent to others	71.25	706.4356689453125	9.75	409.97222900390625	138
like third parties, institutions or internal bodies (EP, par 9a(1)). Whenever possible	71.25	722.1856689453125	9.75	411.0418701171875	139

institutions and citizens.	113.25	125.1856689453125	9.75	105.65730285644531	141
The Council follows this approach by stating that this would “make the citizens’ rights arising	113.25	155.9356689453125	9.75	409.600341796875	142
from this Regulation effective” (Council par. 9a(1)). Differing from the EPs position the	113.25	171.6856689453125	9.75	411.0958251953125	142
Council simply demands a short description of the content. A huge difference shows up in	113.25	186.6856689453125	9.75	409.322509765625	142
the treatment of documents subject to exceptions: “Reference shall not be made if disclosure	113.25	202.4356689453125	9.75	409.726806640625	142
of the reference could undermine the protection of information provided for in Article 4”	113.25	218.1856689453125	9.75	411.10540771484375	142
(Council, par. 9a(2)). Sensitive documents are excluded likewise.	113.25	233.1856689453125	9.75	279.67950439453125	142

The regulation is intended to encompass “all documents held by an institution, that is to say,	113.25	567.6856689453125	9.75	410.33758544921875	152
documents drawn up by it or received from third parties and in its possession, in all areas of	113.25	582.6856689453125	9.75	410.3907470703125	152
activity of the European Union” (Council, par. 1(2)). The European Parliament makes a point	113.25	598.4356689453125	9.75	409.9073486328125	152
in stressing that ‘all areas’ refers to the 2nd and 3rd pillar as well. The Council agrees on that	113.25	614.1856689453125	9.75	410.5330810546875	152
with certain reservations stating that sensitive documents shall get a special treatment.	113.25	629.1856689453125	9.75	376.4574279785156	152
Commission, Parliament and Council are generous as far as the type of medium is	113.25	660.6856689453125	9.75	411.0316162109375	153
concerned. Written as well as electronic or sound, visual or audiovisual-recorded information	113.25	675.6856689453125	9.75	410.35205078125	153
may be requested. Generosity stops here, and the approaches to exceptions vary	113.25	691.4356689453125	9.75	411.04296875	153
significantly in various fields. In case of the future EU-regulation, the European Parliament	113.25	707.1856689453125	9.75	409.92852783203125	153
offers the smallest number of exceptions. The draft foresees that access to documents can	113.25	722.1856689453125	9.75	409.0841064453125	153
be denied if disclosure could significantly undermine public security, monetary stability,	113.25	737.9356689453125	9.75	410.9901123046875	153

defense and military matters, and vital interest relating to the EU’s international relations (EP,	71.25	109.4356689453125	9.75	410.68975830078125	155
par. 4(1a)). Individual privacy is likewise protected. Commercial secrecy is mentioned under	71.25	125.1856689453125	9.75	408.933349609375	155
the European Parliament’s exceptions, too, but has to be balanced against private or public	71.25	140.1856689453125	9.75	409.8960876464844	155
interest in case of disclosure. However, the European Parliament sets certain limits to the	71.25	155.9356689453125	9.75	408.6091613769531	155
protection by demanding that a classification is done immediately and shall be limited in	71.25	171.6856689453125	9.75	409.5426025390625	155
time. If access is denied for an unlimited period of time, the reason for withholding has to be	71.25	186.6856689453125	9.75	409.5134582519531	155
revised regularly (EP, par. 3a(2)).	71.25	202.4356689453125	9.75	140.41351318359375	155
The Commission’s initial proposal gives a much longer and detailed list of exceptions	71.25	233.1856689453125	9.75	411.037353515625	156
including “the effective functioning of the institutions” (Comm, par. 4(1a)). This draft does not	71.25	248.9356689453125	9.75	410.0449523925781	156
require a “balancing test” as the European Parliament’s proposal does. The Council’s	71.25	264.6856689453125	9.75	411.0429382324219	156
position is similar to that of the Commission, but is outstanding in stating “[a]ccess to a	71.25	279.6856689453125	9.75	408.284423828125	156
document which relates to a matter where the decision has not been taken by the Institutions	71.25	295.4356689453125	9.75	410.5596008300781	156
may be denied if its disclosure could seriously undermine the Institution’s decision-making	71.25	311.1856689453125	9.75	410.98724365234375	156
process, unless it is clearly in the public interest to disclose the document” (Council, par.	71.25	326.1856689453125	9.75	410.33416748046875	156
4.2).	71.25	341.9356689453125	9.75	18.901756286621094	156
The Commission suggests likewise excluding “texts for internal use such as discussion	71.25	372.6856689453125	9.75	410.9804992675781	157
documents, opinions of departments, and excluding informal messages” (Comm par. 3a).	71.25	388.4356689453125	9.75	408.5849609375	157
The two other concurrent drafts take also account of the so-called ‘space to think’ clause.	71.25	404.1856689453125	9.75	409.8045959472656	157
The Parliament’s draft limits its exceptions however to documents intended for exchange of	71.25	419.1856689453125	9.75	408.9620056152344	157
idea and brainstorming. The ‘space to think’ is limited to “informal information in the form of	71.25	434.9356689453125	9.75	409.1283874511719	157
written messages which serves the provision of personal opinion or the free exchange of	71.25	450.6856689453125	9.75	408.53741455078125	157
ideas (“brain storming”) within the institutions” (EP, par. 3a). The Council’s proposal	71.25	465.6856689453125	9.75	411.0605773925781	157
resembles the approach of the Commission in its subsequent paragraph, excluding	71.25	481.4356689453125	9.75	411.0279846191406	157
documents “for internal use as part of preliminary consultations and deliberations within the	71.25	497.1856689453125	9.75	409.1380310058594	157
institutions such as discussion documents, unfinished documents or draft documents and	71.25	512.1856689453125	9.75	410.978271484375	157
documents whose content reflects personal opinions” (Council, par. 3a). The European	71.25	527.9356689453125	9.75	411.0627136230469	157
Parliament chooses obviously the most restrictive wording, but leaves broad space for future	71.25	543.6856689453125	9.75	409.5236511230469	157
interpretation, too.	71.25	558.6856689453125	9.75	78.04649353027344	157
Another source of divergence is the definition of those bodies subject to the proposed	71.25	590.1856689453125	9.75	411.0608215332031	158
regulation. Following the obligations of the Amsterdam Treaty, access to documents of the	71.25	605.9356689453125	9.75	408.77362060546875	158
Council, the European Parliament and the Commission has to be considered. The Council’s	71.25	620.9356689453125	9.75	409.8780517578125	158
draft makes no further provisions on that subject. Both Commission and EP define the	71.25	636.6856689453125	9.75	411.0390319824219	158
respective bodies more precisely. The EP mentions the “internal and subsidiary bodies (such	71.25	652.4356689453125	9.75	410.217529296875	158
as Parliament Committees, Council Committees, Working Groups and Commission	71.25	667.4356689453125	9.75	410.9859924316406	158
Directorates-General)” (EP, par. 3b). The Commission’s draft is even more precise, citing	71.25	683.1856689453125	9.75	411.0804138183594	158
each body and the main subbodies (Comm, par. 3c,d,e). It also views the EP’s political	71.25	698.9356689453125	9.75	410.90350341796875	158
groups within the reach of the regulation, a provision that is missing in the EP’s draft.	71.25	713.9356689453125	9.75	366.78057861328125	158

A special point due to the nature of the EU polity is the insertion of provisions concerning	71.25	408.6856689453125	9.75	408.7109069824219	189
third parties. Whereas the definition of third parties remains the same for all three proposals	71.25	424.4356689453125	9.75	410.2953796386719	190
saying that ‘third party’ shall mean “any natural or legal person, or any entity outside the	71.25	440.1856689453125	9.75	408.4391174316406	191
institution, including the Member States, other Community and non-Community institutions	71.25	454.70001220703125	10.23565673828125	410.1830139160156	192
and bodies and non-member countries” (Comm, par. 3f, EP, par. 3f, Council, par. 3c), the	71.25	470.9356689453125	9.75	408.5273132324219	193
question of how to handle documents originating from third parties is contested. The crucial	71.25	486.6856689453125	9.75	409.8042907714844	194
point is, of course, the role of the Member States. The Commission suggests to grant	71.25	501.6856689453125	9.75	408.2588806152344	195
confidentiality according to the preferences of a Member State (Comm, par. 3d) and to apply	71.25	517.4356689453125	9.75	410.1586608886719	196
the regulation only for documents sent to the institutions after entry in force of the regulation	71.25	533.1856689453125	9.75	411.0315246582031	197
(Comm, par. 2 (1)). The European Parliament turns down this approach fearing an	71.25	548.1856689453125	9.75	411.1709899902344	198
undermining of the future regulation. It therefore suggests that Member States and other	71.25	563.9356689453125	9.75	411.05767822265625	199
third parties shall indicate reasons for withholding on the grounds of the exceptions laid	71.25	579.6856689453125	9.75	411.0419616699219	200
down in the EU-regulation on public access. The institution even has the right to decide	71.25	594.6856689453125	9.75	408.7747497558594	201
against the wishes of the third party but is at the same time under obligation to grant a	71.25	610.4356689453125	9.75	408.2314758300781	202
certain space of time to give the opportunity to search for legal intervention (EP, par. 4c). The	71.25	626.1856689453125	9.75	409.6805725097656	203
Council’s definite position on this point was not available for comparative analysis. In the	71.25	641.1856689453125	9.75	411.0937194824219	204
recital it is however laid down that Declaration No 35 attached to the Final Act of the Treaty	71.25	656.9356689453125	9.75	410.0467834472656	205
“will allow a Member State to request the Commission or the Council not to communicate to	71.25	672.6856689453125	9.75	409.4662780761719	206

Another possible scenario for request is not covered by the Commission’s proposal although	113.25	109.4356689453125	9.75	409.368896484375	210
it has proven to be a touchstone between the Community institutions and a Member State.	113.25	125.1856689453125	9.75	409.72393798828125	210
The case of Sweden, releasing more documents under its presidency than the Council, has	113.25	140.1856689453125	9.75	409.8499755859375	210
highlighted the problematic nature of divergent information policies. The European	113.25	155.9356689453125	9.75	411.0830078125	210
Parliament provides in this case that “the Member State shall immediately inform the	113.25	171.6856689453125	9.75	411.017822265625	210
institution” (EP, par. 4d) but leaves it up to the Member State whether to disclose or not on	113.25	186.6856689453125	9.75	409.1802978515625	210
grounds of national legislation. In its justifications the European Parliament however	113.25	202.4356689453125	9.75	411.05352783203125	210
expresses the hope that the Member States respect the “spirit of loyal cooperation.” The	113.25	218.1856689453125	9.75	409.6138916015625	210
Council’s common position with regard to this point remains contested and unclear. The	113.25	233.1856689453125	9.75	411.032470703125	210
wording, which does not get the agreement of all Member States, provides that the Member	113.25	248.9356689453125	9.75	409.25201416015625	210
State “should forward it promptly to this institution for a decision to be taken” (Council, recital	113.25	264.6856689453125	9.75	410.6357421875	210

When assessing the three positions offered by Commission, Parliament and Council, one	113.25	599.1856689453125	9.75	408.60675048828125	223
observes apparent differences in the shaping of openness and transparency. The European	113.25	614.1856689453125	9.75	408.72998046875	223
Parliament clearly takes the most far-reaching position on granting access to documents. It	113.25	629.9356689453125	9.75	409.96319580078125	223
reaffirms the commitment of ready-at-hand information by introducing not only the shortest	113.25	645.6856689453125	9.75	409.42388916015625	223
time limit for answering to requests. It also offers the most detailed provisions concerning	113.25	660.6856689453125	9.75	408.4140625	223
public registers in terms of quick and extensive availability. The proposal is much more	113.25	676.4356689453125	9.75	411.0484619140625	223
generous towards repeated requests than the concurrent drafts. These are treated the same	113.25	692.1856689453125	9.75	409.3389892578125	223
way as all other requests. This is especially important given the aims that are to be fulfilled	113.25	707.1856689453125	9.75	409.1773681640625	223
by transparency and openness. The institutionalization of a European public sphere depends	113.25	722.9356689453125	9.75	410.1072998046875	223
on evolving intermediaries, which work on a regular basis. Interest groups, the media as well	113.25	738.6856689453125	9.75	410.12066650390625	223

as scientific research therefore need the possibility to access information without	71.25	109.4356689453125	9.75	411.00103759765625	225
discrimination.	71.25	125.1856689453125	9.75	62.9534912109375	225
The European Parliament’s draft is also far reaching with regard to the type of document.	71.25	155.9356689453125	9.75	409.6337585449219	226
Though the relevant provisions are somehow vague, the Parliament is clearly more	71.25	171.6856689453125	9.75	411.09893798828125	226
ambitious in granting access to as many documents as possible. This is especially important	71.25	186.6856689453125	9.75	410.4805603027344	226
for those papers drawn up in the initial stages of the policy-making cycle. Public availability	71.25	202.4356689453125	9.75	410.3977966308594	226
of internal documents allows an active participation in policy making as well as	71.25	218.1856689453125	9.75	411.0214538574219	226
accompanying control thus not only relying on ex-post accountability. The proposal is firm in	71.25	233.1856689453125	9.75	409.7430725097656	226
avoiding provisions, which would allow escaping from the regulation by including all three	71.25	248.9356689453125	9.75	408.4316101074219	226
pillars. It therefore denies the setting up of special codes of access granting less access than	71.25	264.6856689453125	9.75	409.919921875	226
once established. Wherever the necessity to withhold documents is conceded by its	71.25	279.6856689453125	9.75	410.98602294921875	226
proposal, the Parliament urges a balancing between conflicting interests. A regular revision	71.25	295.4356689453125	9.75	408.8912658691406	226
of classified documents shall moreover grant the strict commitment to the principle ‘as open	71.25	311.1856689453125	9.75	409.2934265136719	226
as possible’.	71.25	326.1856689453125	9.75	54.68199920654297	226
The Commission’s and the Council’s position are in contrast less open than the European	71.25	357.6856689453125	9.75	411.1709899902344	227
Parliament’s, although different points are highlighted. Both grant a degree of openness and	71.25	372.6856689453125	9.75	409.1070251464844	227
transparency that is not conducive to civic participation and even renders ex post	71.25	388.4356689453125	9.75	411.0467834472656	227
accountability more difficult. The Commission’s proposal encompasses the existing sub-	71.25	404.1856689453125	9.75	411.24676513671875	227
bodies and by doing so, follows the same principles as the Parliament. In deviation from the	71.25	419.1856689453125	9.75	409.3625793457031	227
Council’s position it restricts beneficiaries to legal and natural persons residing in the	71.25	434.9356689453125	9.75	411.0124816894531	227
European Union and is, therefore, less open than the Council. As far as the scope of the	71.25	450.6856689453125	9.75	409.152587890625	227
future regulation is concerned, the Commission stresses the importance of granting	71.25	465.6856689453125	9.75	411.0223083496094	227
confidentiality in order to ensure the effective functioning of the institutions. Internal	71.25	481.4356689453125	9.75	411.052490234375	227
documents are therefore largely covered by exceptions restricting access. A ‘harm test’ to	71.25	497.1856689453125	9.75	409.1832580566406	227
balance the applicants interest in disclosure towards the institution’s interest in confidentiality	71.25	512.1856689453125	9.75	410.421630859375	227
is in no case provided.	71.25	527.9356689453125	9.75	96.82295227050781	227
The Council is even more restrictive than the Commission. The Council is less concerned	71.25	559.4356689453125	9.75	408.4755859375	228
with internal “space to think”-provisions but considers the confidentiality of the decision-	71.25	574.4356689453125	9.75	411.24676513671875	228
making process. Although a ‘harm test’ is foreseen for internal documents concerning issues	71.25	590.1856689453125	9.75	410.2543640136719	228
where a decision has not yet been taken, it is restrictive in another area. It reaffirms its	71.25	605.9356689453125	9.75	409.5349426269531	228
commitment to include documents of all areas but foresees at the same time special	71.25	620.9356689453125	9.75	410.99444580078125	228
procedures for sensitive documents. This attitude is extended to the provisions on public	71.25	636.6856689453125	9.75	408.7254943847656	228
registers. Online registers, which list all documents and provide for direct access to the	71.25	652.4356689453125	9.75	408.535888671875	228
actual paper, would enormously improve opportunities for participation and accountability	71.25	667.4356689453125	9.75	411.0545654296875	228
throughout Europe. The establishment of such registers would allow individuals and interest	71.25	683.1856689453125	9.75	409.61553955078125	228
groups, which are not located at Brussels to bridge the geographic distance and monitor EU	71.25	698.9356689453125	9.75	409.75860595703125	228
politics. Yet, the Council neglects the European Parliament’s considerations on speedy and	71.25	713.9356689453125	9.75	409.06488037109375	228
comprehensive access to registers. Even more important, it restricts the cases to be listed in	71.25	729.6856689453125	9.75	409.74066162109375	228
registers therefore hampering even ex post accountability. The Council is as restricted as the	71.25	745.4356689453125	9.75	409.65130615234375	228

strengthen transparency since Amsterdam, e.g. by involving organized interests. By doing	113.25	171.6856689453125	9.75	408.3839111328125	231
so, it went much further than the Council (Gronbech-Jensen 1998: 191). However, when	113.25	186.6856689453125	9.75	411.188720703125	231
focusing on public access to documents only, these findings have to be reconsidered. It is	113.25	202.4356689453125	9.75	409.52764892578125	231
mainly the European Parliament which acts as a motor for more transparency whereas the	113.25	218.1856689453125	9.75	408.96978759765625	231
Commission’s and the Council’s attitude reflect reservation on public access to documents.	113.25	233.1856689453125	9.75	395.2477111816406	231
5. Conclusion	113.25	277.231201171875	15.75	103.49104309082031	232
Transparency and openness as tools for democratic legitimacy stress the importance of	113.25	314.1856689453125	9.75	409.57073974609375	233
open, simple, and comprehensible policy-making. They are seen as prerequisites to hold	113.25	329.9356689453125	9.75	408.41119384765625	233
political leaders and administrative bodies accountable. Transparency and openness may	113.25	345.6856689453125	9.75	408.4891357421875	233
also prompt civic participation by allowing direct engagement in politics. The most basic	113.25	360.6856689453125	9.75	409.22552490234375	233
instrument to enhance transparency and openness is granting extensive access to	113.25	376.4356689453125	9.75	411.01318359375	233
information. Access to information enables citizens and civic intermediaries to scrutinize the	113.25	392.1856689453125	9.75	409.24200439453125	233
political processes and to engage in them either directly or by means of public debate.	113.25	407.1856689453125	9.75	373.5404052734375	233
Access to information has been one of the means designed to strengthen the legitimacy of	113.25	438.6856689453125	9.75	409.02587890625	234
the EU-polity. Since Amsterdam, this approach has been pursued and improvements in the	113.25	454.4356689453125	9.75	409.0333251953125	234
information policy and accessibility of the European Union through civil society have been	113.25	469.4356689453125	9.75	408.7435302734375	234
achieved.	113.25	485.1856689453125	9.75	40.63639831542969	234
The final shaping of the regulation on access would be subject to yet another paper. 3 In any	113.25	512.936279296875	12.7493896484375	410.61968994140625	235
case, when studying the different suggestions on the regulation regarding public access to	113.25	531.6856689453125	9.75	408.71807861328125	235
European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, current institutional views on	113.25	547.4356689453125	9.75	411.0140380859375	235
transparency and openness turn out to be somehow dissatisfying. The different drafts of	113.25	562.4356689453125	9.75	411.05792236328125	235
Parliament, Commission, and Council reflect the aim to protect the institution’s most vital and	113.25	578.1856689453125	9.75	409.814697265625	235
sensitive areas. The European Parliament is eager to exclude documents concerning party	113.25	593.9356689453125	9.75	409.4293212890625	235
deliberations, the Commission tries to shield internal administrative documents as far as	113.25	608.9356689453125	9.75	408.5111083984375	235
possible and the Council is anxious to protect its decision-making process. The comparison	113.25	624.6856689453125	9.75	411.04974365234375	235
of the drafts on the European Union’s regulation on public access to European Parliament,	113.25	640.4356689453125	9.75	409.54742431640625	235
Council and Commission documents shows that there is no overall perception and	113.25	655.4356689453125	9.75	411.0421142578125	235
conception of democracy, and eventual compromises will continue to reflect these	113.25	671.1856689453125	9.75	411.770263671875	235
ambiguities.	113.25	686.9356689453125	9.75	52.45954895019531	235

Even very open systems like the Swedish one do exclude documents from public scrutiny for	71.25	109.4356689453125	9.75	409.67669677734375	238
various reasons. Taking this into account, the European Parliament’s position is still the most	71.25	125.1856689453125	9.75	410.4649658203125	238
far reaching with regard to an opening up the policy-making process by means of granting	71.25	140.1856689453125	9.75	409.1491394042969	238
access to documents. It suggests a speedy procedure, has no reservations on beneficiaries	71.25	155.9356689453125	9.75	409.9208984375	238
and provides for extensive access to documents in almost all phases of the policy cycle and	71.25	171.6856689453125	9.75	409.5180358886719	238
in many policy fields. It is consequently outstanding in granting opportunities for both	71.25	186.6856689453125	9.75	411.0472717285156	238
accountability and participation. Commission and Council, in contrast, rely more heavily on	71.25	202.4356689453125	9.75	408.75555419921875	238
internal deliberations, which have to be protected up to some degree against the outside	71.25	218.1856689453125	9.75	411.05389404296875	238
world. The Council even renders ex post accountability more difficult. In following the	71.25	233.1856689453125	9.75	411.0242614746094	238
philosophy of diplomat’s secret deliberations, the Council provides for opportunities to hide	71.25	248.9356689453125	9.75	408.54058837890625	238
the very existence of documents. Hopefully, the strengthening of the Parliament’s position	71.25	264.6856689453125	9.75	408.3465576171875	238
has positive effects on better opportunities for civil society. It challenges contrasting views as	71.25	279.6856689453125	9.75	410.2990417480469	238
represented by Commission and Council and may well have some impact on existing power	71.25	295.4356689453125	9.75	409.2806701660156	238
relations, inherent attitudes and final political outcome.	71.25	311.1856689453125	9.75	236.25259399414062	238
Transparency and openness are double-edged weapons. If people use the channels open to	71.25	341.9356689453125	9.75	409.3399963378906	239
them, they may eventually conclude that they do not agree to what is going on in day-to-day	71.25	357.6856689453125	9.75	410.989013671875	239
politics. An upgrading of democratic legitimacy by granting more access to information may	71.25	372.6856689453125	9.75	409.8470764160156	239
then have delegitimizing effects. Output-orientated approaches, stressing that democratic	71.25	388.4356689453125	9.75	408.59228515625	239
legitimacy is best achieved by providing optimal political outcome, namely rules and laws on	71.25	404.1856689453125	9.75	409.4103698730469	239
behalf of the people’s demand, will remain sceptical about the positive effects of participation	71.25	419.1856689453125	9.75	410.0453186035156	239
and accountability through the highest possible degree of transparency and openness.	71.25	434.9356689453125	9.75	411.0326843261719	239
Conversely, one has to put up with possible unintended consequences of transparency if a	71.25	450.6856689453125	9.75	408.8134460449219	239
political system is to be created as a ‘democracy by the people’ instead of a ‘democracy for	71.25	465.6856689453125	9.75	409.8017578125	239
the people’.	71.25	481.4356689453125	9.75	50.29100799560547	239
