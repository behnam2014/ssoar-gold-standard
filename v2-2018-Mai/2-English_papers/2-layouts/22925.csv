parative context. This book represents a very deliberate effort to connect	71.69219970703125	76.5291748046875	9.46405029296875	322.7981262207031	10

and to shake off the mantle of the ‘sui generis’ approach that has frequently	71.69219970703125	102.40631103515625	9.4898681640625	322.7943420410156	10

The overarching argument running through this book is that political	89.62553405761719	128.3350830078125	9.46405029296875	304.8638458251953	10
groups in the European Parliament have become fully institutionalized; they	71.69314575195312	141.28662109375	9.4639892578125	322.8046875	10
dominate decision-making and are very similar animals to their national	71.69314575195312	154.23806762695312	9.4639892578125	322.79620361328125	10
counterparts. The bulk of the book is dedicated to demonstrating that the	71.69314575195312	167.18954467773438	9.4639892578125	322.79248046875	10
political groups have become increasingly cohesive over time and that politics	71.69314575195312	180.14102172851562	9.4639892578125	322.80279541015625	10
in the Parliament has been ‘normalized’, in that party competition is along	71.69314575195312	193.09249877929688	9.4639892578125	322.7990417480469	10
ideological rather than territorial dimensions. An impressive amount of data,	71.69314575195312	206.04397583007812	9.4639892578125	322.798095703125	10
both quantitative and qualitative, is marshalled to convincingly demonstrate	71.69314575195312	218.99545288085938	9.4639892578125	322.7934265136719	10
the validity of these arguments, and the book’s contribution to legislative	71.69314575195312	231.94692993164062	9.4639892578125	322.7952575683594	10
studies and EU politics is indisputable. The book combines theoretical rigour	71.69314575195312	244.89840698242188	9.4639892578125	322.8028869628906	10
with equally rigorous and systematic testing of the main hypotheses and it	71.69314575195312	257.8498840332031	9.4639892578125	322.7962646484375	10
greatly enriches and advances our understanding of the political dynamics	71.69314575195312	270.8013610839844	9.4639892578125	322.8018798828125	10
that operate within the European Parliament.	71.69314575195312	283.7528381347656	9.4639892578125	192.20718383789062	10
The ﬁrst three chapters of the book present the theoretical framework for	89.62553405761719	296.7043151855469	9.4639892578125	304.8628692626953	10
the analysis that follows. Chapter three in particular deserves close reading; it	71.69314575195312	309.6557922363281	9.4639892578125	322.7999572753906	10
is here that the main theoretical argument is developed. The authors theorize	71.69314575195312	322.6072692871094	9.4639892578125	322.7980651855469	10
that, contrary to conventional wisdom, we should not expect to observe terri-	71.69314575195312	335.5587463378906	9.4639892578125	322.78961181640625	10
torial politics in action in the European Parliament. They hypothesize that	71.69314575195312	348.5102233886719	9.4639892578125	322.7952575683594	10
territorial conﬂicts are devolved to lower levels of decision-making within a	71.69314575195312	361.4617004394531	9.4639892578125	322.8028259277344	10
federal structure where they can be resolved most efﬁciently. However, certain	71.69314575195312	374.4131774902344	9.4639892578125	322.81036376953125	10
conﬂicts (particularly economic ones) generate inefﬁciencies if resolved at the	71.69314575195312	387.3646545410156	9.4639892578125	322.8094787597656	10
territorial level and that power in these policy areas is best retained at the	71.69314575195312	400.316162109375	9.464004516601562	322.7914733886719	10
federal level. The theory thus predicts that party competition should be along	71.69314575195312	413.26763916015625	9.464004516601562	322.79998779296875	10
ideological dimensions within federal chambers and the remainder of the book	71.69314575195312	426.2191162109375	9.464004516601562	322.80377197265625	10
is concerned with ﬁnding conﬁrmatory evidence to this effect. Chapters four	71.69314575195312	439.17059326171875	9.464004516601562	322.7952575683594	10
and ﬁve present empirical evidence that participation rates in voting have	71.69314575195312	452.1220703125	9.464004516601562	322.79620361328125	10
increased over time and that cohesion has risen concomitantly with the	71.69314575195312	465.07354736328125	9.464004516601562	322.7999572753906	10
increasing powers of the Parliament itself. Chapter six examines whether or	71.69314575195312	478.0250244140625	9.464004516601562	322.8047180175781	10

pline. Chapter seven considers the tension that may come to bear on members	71.69314575195312	503.927978515625	9.464004516601562	322.79998779296875	10

between their national party and their EP political group. Chapters eight	71.69314575195312	529.8309326171875	9.464004516601562	322.7981262207031	10

study of legislative behaviour has been transformed in the past two decades	48.0171012878418	257.8487548828125	9.4639892578125	322.7981758117676	15
by these analytical techniques. Legislative voting records clearly provide very	48.0171012878418	270.80023193359375	9.4639892578125	322.8000373840332	15
important information about legislative behaviour, voting cohesiveness and	48.0171012878418	283.751708984375	9.4639892578125	322.79997634887695	15
perhaps, though more controversially, ideological preferences. Democratic	48.0171012878418	296.6773681640625	9.48980712890625	322.7895698547363	15
Politics in the European Parliament represents the culmination of an ambitious	48.01708984375	309.62884521484375	9.48980712890625	322.7971496582031	15
and formidable data-collection exercise in this tradition. By collecting all roll	48.01708984375	322.60614013671875	9.4639892578125	322.79998779296875	15
call votes in the European Parliament since 1979 the authors have made an	48.01708984375	335.5576171875	9.4639892578125	322.7877502441406	15
extremely valuable contribution to legislative and EU studies. Already the	48.01708984375	348.50909423828125	9.4639892578125	322.80096435546875	15
data set is being widely used by scholars around the world to various ends.	48.01708984375	361.4605712890625	9.4639892578125	322.7952575683594	15
Our understanding of legislative behaviour in the EP has been and will	48.01708984375	374.41204833984375	9.4639892578125	322.7944030761719	15
continue to be greatly enhanced by the application to this setting of the tech-	48.01708984375	387.363525390625	9.4639892578125	322.798095703125	15
nical tools developed for Congress. But roll call votes also have limitations	48.01708984375	400.31500244140625	9.464004516601562	322.7923889160156	15
and future scholars who make use of this rich data set must be aware of,	48.01708984375	413.2664794921875	9.464004516601562	322.78204345703125	15
acknowledge and correct for the problems associated with their use.	48.01708984375	426.21795654296875	9.464004516601562	289.6560974121094	15
Unlike the US experience, not all votes in the EP are by roll call and this	65.94947814941406	439.16943359375	9.464004516601562	304.8675994873047	15
generates signiﬁcant questions about the representative characteristics of the	48.01708984375	452.12091064453125	9.464004516601562	322.8018798828125	15
samples we observe. Currently roll calls number around one-third of all votes,	48.01708984375	465.0723876953125	9.464004516601562	322.80377197265625	15
and we still know too little about the process by which roll calls are	48.01708984375	478.02386474609375	9.464004516601562	322.78302001953125	15
generated to conclude that this is a random sample from the universe of all	48.01708984375	490.975341796875	9.464004516601562	322.7886657714844	15
votes. Roll calls in the EP may be corrupted by strategic considerations, which	48.01708984375	503.92681884765625	9.464004516601562	322.7895812988281	15
will affect the inferences we can draw from them. Indeed, even where all votes	48.01708984375	516.8782958984375	9.464004516601562	322.8000183105469	15
are recorded by roll call, the range of vote choices and therefore outcomes	48.01708984375	529.8297729492188	9.464004516601562	322.7981262207031	15
will be limited by the inﬂuence of pre-ﬂoor stages of legislative preparation	48.01708984375	542.78125	9.463996887207031	322.798095703125	15
as well as by decisions regarding the ﬂoor agenda (Lawrence et al., 2006).	48.01708984375	555.7327880859375	9.463996887207031	322.7791442871094	15
Thus, even where members have permission to vote according to their	48.01708984375	568.6842651367188	9.463996887207031	322.7943420410156	15

legislative agenda. This issue aside, the more pressing and challenging	71.69219970703125	76.5291748046875	9.46405029296875	322.8028259277344	18
difﬁculty with the use of RCVs in the EP is that the majority of votes go	71.69219970703125	89.480712890625	9.4639892578125	322.782958984375	18
unrecorded.	71.69219970703125	102.43212890625	9.46405029296875	50.664581298828125	18
Hix et al. (2007: 30) hold that it is not unreasonable to assume that roll call	89.62458801269531	115.3836669921875	9.4639892578125	304.85340881347656	18
votes are requested on the most important issues in the EP. But preliminary	71.69219970703125	128.3350830078125	9.46405029296875	322.7943420410156	18
research (Carrubba et al., 2006) on votes in the ﬁfth Parliament (1999–2004)	71.69219970703125	141.28662109375	9.4639892578125	322.767822265625	18
suggest that roll calls are disproportionately called on resolutions rather than	71.69219970703125	154.23806762695312	9.4639892578125	322.79339599609375	18
under the co-decision procedure. Thus, legislatively consequential votes are	71.69219970703125	167.18954467773438	9.4639892578125	322.8075256347656	18
under-sampled, which may run counter to the argument that roll calls are	71.69219970703125	180.14102172851562	9.4639892578125	322.799072265625	18
called on the most important votes. If the assumption of importance is	71.69219970703125	193.09249877929688	9.4639892578125	322.79425048828125	18
weakened, does this affect the inferences we draw? How might this over-	71.69219970703125	206.04397583007812	9.4639892578125	322.79052734375	18
representation of votes on non-legislative issues affect our conﬁdence in	71.69219970703125	218.99545288085938	9.4639892578125	322.80279541015625	18
cohesion indices or NOMINATE scores? With regard to cohesion, the	71.69219970703125	231.94692993164062	9.4639892578125	322.7962341308594	18
direction of bias introduced by the over-sampling of non-legislative votes is	71.69219970703125	244.89840698242188	9.4639892578125	322.8047180175781	18
not by any means obvious. On the one hand, this underrepresentation of	71.69219970703125	257.8498840332031	9.4639892578125	322.7877197265625	18
legislative votes in the roll call sample may bias the levels of cohesion down-	71.69219970703125	270.8013610839844	9.4639892578125	322.8000183105469	18
wards. If most roll call votes are of little legislative consequence, do political	71.69219970703125	283.7528381347656	9.4639892578125	322.7943115234375	18
groups bother expending limited resources on whipping party members into	71.69219970703125	296.7043151855469	9.4639892578125	322.79998779296875	18
line? On the other hand, as the authors demonstrate in chapter four,	71.69219970703125	309.6557922363281	9.4639892578125	322.79620361328125	18
attendance at roll call votes goes up with the legislative importance of the vote.	71.69219970703125	322.6072692871094	9.4639892578125	322.7895202636719	18
Is it the case that only the most loyal, career-minded MEPs turn up for votes	71.69219970703125	335.5587463378906	9.4639892578125	322.79144287109375	18
on resolutions? This may have the effect of inﬂating the actual levels of	71.69219970703125	348.5102233886719	9.4639892578125	322.7905578613281	18
cohesion of political groups in the EP, if such votes are over-sampled. Yet	71.69219970703125	361.4617004394531	9.4639892578125	322.79058837890625	18
another possibility is that the lower turnout on resolutions reﬂects the fact that	71.69219970703125	374.4131774902344	9.4639892578125	322.7981262207031	18
only those truly interested turn up, and that the subset of votes thus reﬂects	71.69219970703125	387.3646545410156	9.4639892578125	322.79052734375	18
the interests of preference outliers. We do not know the answers to such	71.69219970703125	400.316162109375	9.464004516601562	322.7961730957031	18
questions; it may very well be that attendance rates or legislative signiﬁcance	71.69219970703125	413.26763916015625	9.464004516601562	322.7905578613281	18
are not related systematically to levels of cohesion. The countervailing	71.69219970703125	426.2191162109375	9.464004516601562	322.7981262207031	18
dynamics that potentially exist here suggest some interesting questions that	71.69219970703125	439.17059326171875	9.464004516601562	322.798095703125	18
future analysts mining this data set will need to consider.	71.69219970703125	452.1220703125	9.464004516601562	241.23635864257812	18
The authors further document that the number of roll calls has increased	89.62458801269531	465.07354736328125	9.464004516601562	304.8713836669922	18
dramatically over time, which may in part diminish the importance of the	71.69219970703125	478.0250244140625	9.464004516601562	322.798095703125	18
above questions; as the number of votes increases, their representative nature	71.69219970703125	490.97650146484375	9.464004516601562	322.8047790527344	18
is likely to improve. But do these varying levels of roll calls give rise to	71.69219970703125	503.927978515625	9.464004516601562	322.7952880859375	18
additional concerns about cross-parliamentary comparisons? There were	71.69219970703125	516.8794555664062	9.464004516601562	322.8038024902344	18
fewer than 900 roll calls in the ﬁrst Parliament (1979–84), compared with over	71.69219970703125	529.8309326171875	9.464004516601562	322.78863525390625	18
5000 in the ﬁfth (1999–2004). Can we have the same conﬁdence in the results	71.69219970703125	542.7824096679688	9.463996887207031	322.7763671875	18
drawn from the much smaller samples in the early Parliaments as we do in	71.69219970703125	555.73388671875	9.463996887207031	322.8000793457031	18
those from the fourth and ﬁfth Parliaments?	71.69219970703125	568.6853637695312	9.463996887207031	187.333251953125	18
A more general shortcoming of the NOMINATE procedure is that it does	89.62458801269531	581.6368408203125	9.463996887207031	304.8704376220703	18
not typically provide uncertainty estimates (such as standard errors and	71.69219970703125	594.5883178710938	9.464000701904297	322.7886962890625	18

conﬁdence intervals). This may lead to a false sense of precision for those who	48.0171012878418	63.5777587890625	9.4639892578125	322.8010139465332	21

vote a mere handful of times. This reﬂects high absentee rates, comparatively	48.016822814941406	128.3349609375	9.46405029296875	322.7961959838867	21

perhaps, strategic absences (not to be confused with ofﬁcial abstentions). For	48.016822814941406	154.23794555664062	9.4639892578125	322.79332733154297	21

and judiciously, shy away from this particular interpretation in the context of	48.016822814941406	283.7527160644531	9.4639892578125	322.7971725463867	21

mated if we are to test theories of legislative decision-making or address	48.016822814941406	348.5101013183594	9.4639892578125	322.79528045654297	21
questions about whether or not key parliamentary bodies such as committees	48.016822814941406	361.4615783691406	9.4639892578125	322.7953109741211	21
are representative agents of their principal (Parliament). Alternative measures	48.016822814941406	374.4130554199219	9.4639892578125	322.81139373779297	21
such as elite surveys suffer from serious sample response issues, and even	48.016822814941406	387.3645324707031	9.4639892578125	322.8056869506836	21
this aside there is no actual obligation on those who respond to be truthful.	48.016822814941406	400.3160400390625	9.464004516601562	322.7924118041992	21
Measures based on constituency characteristics , which have proved popular	48.016822814941406	413.26751708984375	9.464004516601562	322.80089569091797	21
in the USA, are also problematic given the very vague notion of constituency	48.016822814941406	426.218994140625	9.464004516601562	322.78954315185547	21

bipolarity (Snyder, 1992). There is clearly no silver bullet solution to the	48.016822814941406	478.02490234375	9.464004516601562	322.79244232177734	21

Similarly, testing spatial models of legislative behaviour fundamentally	65.94921112060547	516.8793334960938	9.464004516601562	304.8704605102539	21

cal dimensions on which parties compete. The authors’ analysis of roll call	48.016822814941406	542.7822875976562	9.463996887207031	322.79991912841797	21
voting in chapter nine demonstrates that there are broadly two dimensions on	48.016822814941406	555.7337646484375	9.463996887207031	322.79805755615234	21
which the political groups compete and that these dimensions have been	48.016822814941406	568.6852416992188	9.463996887207031	322.7999801635742	21
relatively stable over time. The ﬁrst dimension fairly conclusively maps a	48.016822814941406	581.63671875	9.463996887207031	322.7942428588867	21
general left–right policy dimension, which lends weight to the overall	48.016822814941406	594.5881958007812	9.464000701904297	322.80379486083984	21

torially. But the second dimension, the authors readily admit, is more difﬁcult	71.69219970703125	76.5291748046875	9.46405029296875	322.7914733886719	24

integration dimension. The interpretation of dimensions relies primarily on a	71.69219970703125	115.3836669921875	9.4639892578125	322.8094482421875	24
researcher’s substantive knowledge but may be complicated in the case of the	71.69219970703125	128.3350830078125	9.46405029296875	322.7970886230469	24
EP if selection biases are evident in roll call votes. Again the question of the	71.69219970703125	141.28662109375	9.4639892578125	322.79241943359375	24
representativeness of roll calls is fundamental here. If RCVs are not repre-	71.69219970703125	154.23806762695312	9.4639892578125	322.8009948730469	24
sentative by issue area, this may affect the conclusions we draw about the	71.69219970703125	167.18954467773438	9.4639892578125	322.783935546875	24
nature of the policy space. If roll calls are called disproportionately in certain	71.69219970703125	180.14102172851562	9.4639892578125	322.7952880859375	24
policy domains, this may lead to the overemphasis of particular dimensions	71.69219970703125	193.09249877929688	9.4639892578125	322.796142578125	24
of conﬂict in NOMINATE-type analysis.	71.69219970703125	206.04397583007812	9.4639892578125	168.7478485107422	24
Carrubba et al. (2006) suggest that a degree of caution is required in the	89.62458801269531	218.99545288085938	9.4639892578125	304.84776306152344	24
interpretation of and generalization from roll calls in the European Parliament.	71.69219970703125	231.94692993164062	9.4639892578125	322.8028259277344	24
Overall, their work ﬁnds evidence for pooling concerns, the asymmetric use	71.69219970703125	244.89840698242188	9.4639892578125	322.79522705078125	24
of roll calls under different legislative procedures and the calling of RCVs	71.69219970703125	257.8498840332031	9.4639892578125	322.8009338378906	24
disproportionately by particular political groups (notably the Greens) and in	71.69219970703125	270.8013610839844	9.4639892578125	322.8000183105469	24
particular issue areas. More work on disaggregated votes may lead to in-	71.69219970703125	283.7528381347656	9.4639892578125	322.7867126464844	24
teresting ﬁndings; pooling RCVs on co-decisions with those on resolutions	71.69219970703125	296.7043151855469	9.4639892578125	322.7980651855469	24
may not be ideal without ﬁrst knowing for certain that they are generated by	71.69219970703125	309.6557922363281	9.4639892578125	322.7877502441406	24
the same processes and whether they experience the same degree of whipping.	71.69219970703125	322.6072692871094	9.4639892578125	322.8046569824219	24
None of this is to argue that the use of roll calls should be abandoned but	71.69219970703125	335.5587463378906	9.4639892578125	322.7914733886719	24
rather their use necessitates explicit consideration of the process by which roll	71.69219970703125	348.5102233886719	9.4639892578125	322.80657958984375	24
calls are produced. In addition, disaggregating votes by issue area might prove	71.69219970703125	361.4617004394531	9.4639892578125	322.7981262207031	24
a fruitful exercise: for instance, does the subsample of votes on environmental	71.69219970703125	374.4131774902344	9.4639892578125	322.7971496582031	24
issues lead to a clear green policy dimension emerging? More work on compar-	71.69219970703125	387.3646545410156	9.4639892578125	322.8076171875	24
ing the sample of roll calls to the universe of actual (and indeed potential)	71.69219970703125	400.316162109375	9.464004516601562	322.8047180175781	24
votes would greatly enhance our conﬁdence in the inferences we draw. Overall	71.69219970703125	413.26763916015625	9.464004516601562	322.8019104003906	24
these issues suggest that the analysis of roll call votes has much potential.	71.69219970703125	426.2191162109375	9.464004516601562	322.7914733886719	24
There is clearly scope for further development of roll call analyses through the	71.69219970703125	439.17059326171875	9.464004516601562	322.8094787597656	24
use of more sophisticated techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain	71.69219970703125	452.1220703125	9.464004516601562	322.7914733886719	24
(MCMC) modelling, which also generates uncertainty estimates. In conclusion,	71.69219970703125	465.07354736328125	9.464004516601562	322.8009338378906	24

Despite the particular issues that arise with the use of RCVs in the EP, it is	71.69219970703125	555.7304077148438	9.463996887207031	322.7895202636719	26
convincingly demonstrated over the course of this book that the political	71.69219970703125	568.681884765625	9.463996887207031	322.7962646484375	26

time. A crucial question that the work thus motivates is how such unity is	48.0171012878418	63.5777587890625	9.4639892578125	322.7933540344238	29
created. Political parties in established democracies typically exhibit such	48.0171012878418	76.5291748046875	9.46405029296875	322.8038215637207	29
high levels of cohesion that the question of how such discipline has arisen	48.0171012878418	89.480712890625	9.4639892578125	322.8056831359863	29
has, until recently, received little attention (Bowler et al., 1999). In emerging	48.0171012878418	102.43212890625	9.46405029296875	322.7972297668457	29

to achieve this end? How party discipline arises and how it is maintained are	48.0171012878418	141.28662109375	9.4639892578125	322.7896614074707	29
central questions of interest in legislative studies. Our knowledge of these	48.0171012878418	154.23806762695312	9.4639892578125	322.8038215637207	29

If we are fully to disentangle the concepts of ideological afﬁnity and party	65.9494857788086	206.04397583007812	9.4639892578125	304.86856842041016	29
discipline, we need to look beyond the voting behaviour of MEPs. A party	48.01709747314453	218.99545288085938	9.4639892578125	322.78768157958984	29
that is cohesive because of an afﬁnity of ideological viewpoints and a	48.01709747314453	231.94692993164062	9.4639892578125	322.7933578491211	29

Krehbiel (1993) has put the argument for afﬁnity mostly forcefully, arguing	48.01709747314453	270.8013610839844	9.4639892578125	322.8019027709961	29
that parties merely reﬂect their members’ preferences; they provide neither	48.01709747314453	283.7528381347656	9.4639892578125	322.80944061279297	29
structure nor constraint. He posits that legislative outcomes (via voting) are	48.01709747314453	296.7043151855469	9.4639892578125	322.7952194213867	29

Parliament provides a particularly interesting case study because these	48.01709747314453	374.4131774902344	9.4639892578125	322.7981185913086	29
inducements are very weak, if not entirely missing. To the extent that	48.01709747314453	387.3646545410156	9.4639892578125	322.80004119873047	29

when compared with their national counterparts. They do not control access	48.01709747314453	426.2191162109375	9.464004516601562	322.79805755615234	29

will force early elections. Although the prospects for cohesion appear quite	48.01709747314453	465.07354736328125	9.464004516601562	322.8047409057617	29
bleak, the book by Hix et al. (2007) demonstrates quite persuasively that this	48.01709747314453	478.0250244140625	9.464004516601562	322.7820358276367	29
has not been the experience of the political groups in the EP. Given the highly	48.01709747314453	490.97650146484375	9.464004516601562	322.8075180053711	29

behaviour. The European Parliament offers scholars a particularly good case	71.69219970703125	154.23806762695312	9.4639892578125	322.7971496582031	32

electoral connection is not clearly dominant. One obvious avenue of research	71.69219970703125	193.09249877929688	9.4639892578125	322.8047790527344	32
is to examine whether or not those who vote against the party are sanctioned	71.69219970703125	206.04397583007812	9.4639892578125	322.78863525390625	32
via the loss of valuable ofﬁces within the Parliament or the political group	71.69219970703125	218.99545288085938	9.4639892578125	322.7933654785156	32
structure. Does the committee system, for instance, provide the political	71.69219970703125	231.94692993164062	9.4639892578125	322.8038024902344	32
groups with an important source of patronage, in addition to acting as a	71.69219970703125	244.89840698242188	9.4639892578125	322.7810363769531	32

lifeblood of the European Parliament. The political groups have played a	71.69219970703125	283.7528381347656	9.4639892578125	322.79998779296875	32

committees from the outset. In particular, the committee assignment process	71.69219970703125	309.6557922363281	9.4639892578125	322.80096435546875	32
is controlled by political groups rather than through a seniority-type norm as	71.69219970703125	322.6072692871094	9.4639892578125	322.7962341308594	32
in the US Congress. In addition, there is a clear hierarchy of committees, with	71.69219970703125	335.5587463378906	9.4639892578125	322.7952575683594	32
committee prestige largely determined by the degree of legislative powers the	71.69219970703125	348.5102233886719	9.4639892578125	322.8047180175781	32

committees are very much sought after by ambitious MEPs. This hierarchy	71.69219970703125	374.4131774902344	9.4639892578125	322.8000183105469	32
of prestige and control of the assignment process grants the party leaders	71.69219970703125	387.3646545410156	9.4639892578125	322.79150390625	32
some power vis-à-vis individual MEPs. Not only has the committee system	71.69219970703125	400.316162109375	9.464004516601562	322.7981262207031	32
expanded to provide ‘jobs for the boys’, but control over the committee	71.69219970703125	413.26763916015625	9.464004516601562	322.7952880859375	32

the years. In general, the career trajectories of MEPs and how these relate to	71.69219970703125	439.17059326171875	9.464004516601562	322.79620361328125	32

tunities for future legislative scholars. How do MEPs’ career expectations	71.69219970703125	465.07354736328125	9.464004516601562	322.8047180175781	32
inﬂuence their legislative behaviour and, in turn, how does this behaviour	71.69219970703125	478.0250244140625	9.464004516601562	322.7952575683594	32

On a related note, the question of who controls the MEPs – national	89.62458801269531	503.927978515625	9.464004516601562	304.8638153076172	32
parties or political groups – is addressed in chapter seven. The evidence here	71.69219970703125	516.8794555664062	9.464004516601562	322.80377197265625	32
suggests that members vote with their political group most of the time, but	71.69219970703125	529.8309326171875	9.464004516601562	322.7895812988281	32
there is also evidence of voting against the political group in favour of a	71.69219970703125	542.7824096679688	9.463996887207031	322.79144287109375	32

statistical note, it is worth considering that in any group versus subgroup	71.69219970703125	568.6853637695312	9.463996887207031	322.7933654785156	32

small, as is the case with many national delegations. The overall result that	48.0171012878418	76.5291748046875	9.46405029296875	322.7962532043457	35

cohesion scores taken at face value might indicate. Interesting questions arise	48.0171012878418	115.3836669921875	9.4639892578125	322.8028450012207	35

cal group structure, perhaps as a function of size? Can fully institutionalized	48.0171012878418	167.18954467773438	9.4639892578125	322.7970771789551	35
national political parties be conceived of as similar to factions within the	48.0171012878418	180.14102172851562	9.4639892578125	322.7923774719238	35
supranational political group? One obvious question that needs to be	48.0171012878418	193.09249877929688	9.4639892578125	322.7924690246582	35
addressed further is whether or not national delegations are given	48.0171012878418	206.04397583007812	9.4639892578125	322.79814529418945	35
exemptions by their political group on certain votes. This may occur for	48.0171012878418	218.99545288085938	9.4639892578125	322.7943000793457	35

of agenda-setting powers will be conditional on party size, though clearly the	48.0171012878418	452.12005615234375	9.464004516601562	322.79338455200195	37
two issues are conceptually distinct. The results in chapter six are on the whole	48.0171012878418	465.071533203125	9.464004516601562	322.8075752258301	37

or do we accept the ancillary hypothesis that the measures for such complex	48.0171012878418	555.7318725585938	9.463996887207031	322.7933235168457	37

of the past 30 years, which would indicate that agenda-setting powers are not	71.69204711914062	244.89739990234375	9.4639892578125	322.7820129394531	40
perceived as irrelevant by the main actors. Procedural matters may not be of	71.69204711914062	257.848876953125	9.4639892578125	322.78485107421875	40

(Binder, 1997), but where such conditions are absent, as in the EP, legislative	71.69204711914062	283.7518310546875	9.4639892578125	322.7962951660156	40

with a non-partisan account of procedural choice. As Willi Rothley	71.69204711914062	348.50921630859375	9.4639892578125	322.7886657714844	40

cohesion? Is a rule that limits the speaking rights of individual members	71.69204711914062	503.92694091796875	9.464004516601562	322.80377197265625	40
simply an attempt to use a limited parliamentary schedule more efﬁciently,	71.69204711914062	516.87841796875	9.464004516601562	322.79058837890625	40
or does it signal an attempt to reduce the rights of individual parliamen-	71.69204711914062	529.8298950195312	9.464004516601562	322.79718017578125	40

even if intended for some more partisan purpose; it is in the interests of the	71.69204711914062	555.73291015625	9.463996887207031	322.8019104003906	40
proposer to cloak them in neutral language. In addition, it is possible that	71.69204711914062	568.6843872070312	9.463996887207031	322.7886962890625	40

agenda powers. Much of the debate hinged on the rights of big groups versus	48.01709747314453	180.14102172851562	9.4639892578125	322.7896041870117	43
small groups, but it was also asserted that the proposed revisions aimed to	48.01709747314453	193.09249877929688	9.4639892578125	322.79341888427734	43
quell dissent within the large political groups themselves. Mario Capanna,	48.01709747314453	206.04397583007812	9.4639892578125	322.79903411865234	43

Else Hammerick, of the small left-wing Rainbow coalition (ARC), reiterated	48.0171012878418	296.70269775390625	9.4639892578125	322.79899978637695	45

pecking orders and hierarchies, and correspondingly weaken those who do not	65.94979858398438	406.5562744140625	8.468002319335938	304.87255859375	46

from individual members. For instance, the right to table amendments in	48.01741027832031	516.8768310546875	9.464004516601562	322.79908752441406	47

these revisions, individual members have been emasculated. Speaking time	48.01741027832031	581.6342163085938	9.463996887207031	322.7981719970703	47

has also been drastically reduced over the years. In April 1979 there was	71.69219970703125	63.5777587890625	9.4639892578125	322.7867431640625	50

adjournment rights in the EP, and what rights they did have, have been	71.69219970703125	206.04397583007812	9.4639892578125	322.7829895019531	50
severely circumscribed over the course of the past 25 years. Over the years,	71.69219970703125	218.99545288085938	9.4639892578125	322.7857971191406	50
political groups have become the gatekeepers of legislative amendments and	71.69219970703125	231.94692993164062	9.4639892578125	322.7951965332031	50

analysis of the debates on this matter suggest that the two largest political	71.69219970703125	257.8498840332031	9.4639892578125	322.78289794921875	50
groups consciously undertook these rule changes. Before we dismiss the role	71.69219970703125	270.8013610839844	9.4639892578125	322.8076171875	50
of agenda-setting powers in creating political group cohesion we should	71.69219970703125	283.7528381347656	9.4639892578125	322.79620361328125	50
examine rule evolution in this institution in greater detail.	71.69219970703125	296.7043151855469	9.4639892578125	243.47274780273438	50

Parties form, fail, merge and divide on a staggering basis in the EP. Simply	71.69219970703125	361.4596252441406	9.4639892578125	322.7942810058594	52
keeping track of which MEPs are in which political groups and which national	71.69219970703125	374.4111022949219	9.4639892578125	322.8009948730469	52
parties are afﬁliated with which of the supranational groups is no mean feat.	71.69219970703125	387.3625793457031	9.4639892578125	322.79150390625	52
It is generally the case that in the literature on political parties far too little	71.69219970703125	400.3140869140625	9.464004516601562	322.79339599609375	52
attention is paid ‘to the evolution of party systems between elections’ (Laver	71.69219970703125	413.26556396484375	9.464004516601562	322.7906494140625	52
and Benoit, 2003). The authors of this book argue that there are ‘six main	71.69219970703125	426.217041015625	9.464004516601562	322.783935546875	52
political “families” which have remained relatively consistent across all six	71.69219970703125	439.16851806640625	9.464004516601562	322.79901123046875	52
elected parliaments’ (Hix et al., 2007: 23) and they identify these as social	71.69219970703125	452.1199951171875	9.464004516601562	322.7887268066406	52
democrat, centre-right, liberal, radical left, green and anti-European. This is	71.69219970703125	465.07147216796875	9.464004516601562	322.79998779296875	52
not a controversial claim, but the use of six party ‘families’ as the basic unit	71.69219970703125	478.02294921875	9.464004516601562	322.7943420410156	52
of analysis in parts of the book may not capture the full extent of dynamism	71.69219970703125	490.97442626953125	9.464004516601562	322.78863525390625	52
that exists in the EP. This dynamism in party group formation is also of	71.69219970703125	503.9259033203125	9.464004516601562	322.7877197265625	52
interest to the very question of cohesion. Party families do not whip members	71.69219970703125	516.8773803710938	9.464004516601562	322.7953186035156	52
into line and this choice of analytical unit may depress the cohesion scores	71.69219970703125	529.828857421875	9.464004516601562	322.7991027832031	52
for the smaller political groups, which appear at times to have been merged	71.69219970703125	542.7803344726562	9.463996887207031	322.79437255859375	52
by the authors into one family. As the authors openly acknowledge, the	71.69219970703125	555.7318115234375	9.463996887207031	322.7962341308594	52
radical left comprised several different political groups until well into the	71.69219970703125	568.6832885742188	9.463996887207031	322.80572509765625	52
third Parliament. Even excluding independents, there were 10 separate	71.69219970703125	581.634765625	9.463996887207031	322.8066711425781	52

political groups in the EP for most of the third legislative session, not six. The	48.0171012878418	63.5777587890625	9.4639892578125	322.80376052856445	55
number of political groups in the EP varies over time and only the three main	48.0171012878418	76.5291748046875	9.46405029296875	322.7980842590332	55
political groups can be thought of as party families in the traditional sense	48.0171012878418	89.480712890625	9.4639892578125	322.7971382141113	55

As a general explanatory variable, party family has shortcomings when	65.9494857788086	115.3836669921875	9.4639892578125	304.85819244384766	55
it comes to explaining the dynamic nature of political groups in the EP.	48.01709747314453	128.3350830078125	9.46405029296875	322.79524993896484	55

groupings originally formed, the party family explanation inadequately	48.01709747314453	154.23806762695312	9.4639892578125	322.80098724365234	55
explains national party afﬁliation with EP party groups. First, party family is	48.01709747314453	167.18954467773438	9.4639892578125	322.78771209716797	55
an essentially static characterization, based on long-standing, ‘essential and	48.01709747314453	180.14102172851562	9.4639892578125	322.79161834716797	55
indelible’ (Klingemann et al., 1994: 24) issue associations and positions,	48.01709747314453	193.09249877929688	9.4639892578125	322.78966522216797	55
whereas national parties frequently and regularly switch EP party groups.	48.01709747314453	206.04397583007812	9.4639892578125	322.80001068115234	55
Second, many national parties do not belong to clearly deﬁnable party	48.01709747314453	218.99545288085938	9.4639892578125	322.7905807495117	55
families, either because their organizational basis does not correspond to the	48.01709747314453	231.94692993164062	9.4639892578125	322.7933578491211	55
classic cleavages or because they are formed primarily around new (single)	48.01709747314453	244.89840698242188	9.4639892578125	322.79808807373047	55
issues such as Europe or immigration. This situation characterizes many of	48.01709747314453	257.8498840332031	9.4639892578125	322.79625701904297	55
the parties from the eight post-communist member states.	48.01709747314453	270.8013610839844	9.4639892578125	245.64855194091797	55
A general problem with the concept of party family as an operational	65.9494857788086	283.7528381347656	9.4639892578125	304.85157012939453	55
variable is that, despite its wide use, the classiﬁcation of party family remains	48.01709747314453	296.7043151855469	9.4639892578125	322.79524993896484	55
underspeciﬁed. Even after years of research, there exists no golden index of	48.01709747314453	309.6557922363281	9.4639892578125	322.8075485229492	55
party family afﬁliations. This problem is exacerbated when one attempts to	48.01709747314453	322.6072692871094	9.4639892578125	322.78768157958984	55
extend the concept of party family beyond its West European base. For	48.01709747314453	335.5587463378906	9.4639892578125	322.78963470458984	55
instance, there are large numbers of parties in Eastern Europe that cannot	48.01709747314453	348.5102233886719	9.4639892578125	322.7971725463867	55
easily be classiﬁed in terms of party families because they do not share either	48.01709747314453	361.4617004394531	9.4639892578125	322.7877426147461	55
an ideological heritage or associational links with their West European	48.01709747314453	374.4131774902344	9.4639892578125	322.7971420288086	55
counterparts. Even advocates of the party family approach and experts in the	48.01709747314453	387.3646545410156	9.4639892578125	322.79247283935547	55
politics of Eastern Europe cannot place these political parties deﬁnitively into	48.01709747314453	400.316162109375	9.464004516601562	322.7999801635742	55
party families. For instance, Taggart and Szczerbiak (2004) place many parties	48.01709747314453	413.26763916015625	9.464004516601562	322.78389739990234	55
such as the Czech Civic Democratic Party, the Slovak Christian Democratic	48.01709747314453	426.2191162109375	9.464004516601562	322.7896041870117	55
Movement and the Polish Union of Real Politics into both the Liberal and	48.01709747314453	439.17059326171875	9.464004516601562	322.79329681396484	55
Conservative party family in their study. There is much disagreement on what	48.01709747314453	452.1220703125	9.464004516601562	322.80477142333984	55
even constitutes a party family. For example, do agrarian and centre parties	48.01709747314453	465.07354736328125	9.464004516601562	322.79048919677734	55
form one party family or two party families? Nonetheless, the association	48.01709747314453	478.0250244140625	9.464004516601562	322.79622650146484	55
between party family and policies towards European integration has been	48.01709747314453	490.97650146484375	9.464004516601562	322.79430389404297	55
used to conclude that political contestation in the European arena is largely	48.01709747314453	503.927978515625	9.464004516601562	322.7943344116211	55
driven by cleavage patterns (Marks and Wilson, 2000; Marks et al., 2002).	48.01709747314453	516.8794555664062	9.464004516601562	310.7542037963867	55
The dynamics and evolution of the party system within the EP offer a	65.9494857788086	529.8309326171875	9.464004516601562	304.85437774658203	55

dynamism offers interesting possibilities. Are national parties or MEPs who	48.01709747314453	555.73388671875	9.463996887207031	322.80098724365234	55

of changing party afﬁliation? If they fail to do so, we may have evidence of	71.69219970703125	63.5777587890625	9.4639892578125	322.79058837890625	58
partyless voting behaviour and perhaps have more conﬁdence in the use of	71.69219970703125	76.5291748046875	9.46405029296875	322.7952880859375	58
NOMINATE scores as ideological proxies. If, however, we witness change	71.69219970703125	89.480712890625	9.4639892578125	322.798095703125	58
this may be further evidence of party discipline. If legislators switch from a	71.69219970703125	102.43212890625	9.46405029296875	322.80279541015625	58
more to a less disciplined party (or vice versa) and thus become subject to	71.69219970703125	115.3836669921875	9.4639892578125	322.7915344238281	58
shifting degrees of party instruction across roll calls, the matter becomes even	71.69219970703125	128.3350830078125	9.46405029296875	322.80853271484375	58
more complex (Rosenthal and Voeten, 2004). In future work one could address	71.69219970703125	141.28662109375	9.4639892578125	322.7971496582031	58

These are exciting times for EP scholars. Better data and analytical tools have	71.69219970703125	244.89712524414062	9.4639892578125	322.7857360839844	60
become available in recent years that allow for much more systematic analysis	71.69219970703125	257.8486022949219	9.4639892578125	322.7877197265625	60
of legislative behaviour. In Democratic Politics in the European Parliament, Hix,	71.69219970703125	270.7742614746094	9.48980712890625	322.7876892089844	60
Noury and Roland ask many fundamental questions about the nature of	71.69219970703125	283.7515563964844	9.4639892578125	322.7839050292969	60

answers. Perhaps even more importantly, this book challenges and motivates	71.69219970703125	309.6545104980469	9.4639892578125	322.7923889160156	60
a whole host of new puzzles, in the ﬁnest traditions of scientiﬁc research, and	71.69219970703125	322.6059875488281	9.4639892578125	322.78955078125	60

On a ﬁnal note, this book has fulﬁlled its mission to connect research on	89.62458801269531	348.5089416503906	9.4639892578125	304.85337829589844	60

institutions in political science. The true promise and potential of EU scholar-	71.69219970703125	374.4118957519531	9.4639892578125	322.8018798828125	60
ship is that it provides a testing ground for extant theories of legislative	71.69219970703125	387.3633728027344	9.4639892578125	322.79718017578125	60
behaviour, reinforcing what we already know and offering the possibility of	71.69219970703125	400.31488037109375	9.464004516601562	322.7990417480469	60
falsiﬁcation and, most importantly, the opportunity to broaden the trends in	71.69219970703125	413.266357421875	9.464004516601562	322.7886962890625	60
legislative studies in general. It is remarkable that our understanding of	71.69219970703125	426.21783447265625	9.464004516601562	322.7961730957031	60
legislative politics is largely dictated by the experience of the US House of	71.69219970703125	439.1693115234375	9.464004516601562	322.79718017578125	60
Representatives. The similarities with the EP make for relatively easy	71.69219970703125	452.12078857421875	9.464004516601562	322.8009338378906	60
comparison, but it is perhaps the differences, such as the lack of an electoral	71.69219970703125	465.072265625	9.464004516601562	322.79998779296875	60
connection, that will be most instructive. How such differences inﬂuence	71.69219970703125	478.02374267578125	9.464004516601562	322.80194091796875	60
