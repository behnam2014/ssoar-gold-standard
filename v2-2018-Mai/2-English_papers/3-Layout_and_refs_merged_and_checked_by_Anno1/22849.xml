equally among all group members; hence, the hypotheses concerning the relationship between	49.60609436035156	455.5010986328125	9.004547119140625	382.67494201660156	32
equality principle is followed in the distribution PWE and the sucker effect are considered. First,	49.60609436035156	466.50091552734375	9.0045166015625	382.6822052001953	32

Furnham,1990b; Heaven, 1989), we anticipated	246.94480895996094	224.50225830078125	9.0	185.3198699951172	96
that the global construct was a combination	246.94480895996094	235.50204467773438	9.0	185.32798767089844	96
of at least three components: belief that work	246.94480895996094	246.5018310546875	9.0	185.33702087402344	96

(equity component). We constructed the gobal	246.94480895996094	301.5007629394531	9.0	185.3721160888672	96

added additional items designed to measure	246.94480895996094	334.5001220703125	9.0	185.2875518798828	96
more preferences for equity in the distribution of	246.94480895996094	345.4999084472656	9.0	185.34779357910156	96
resources. We factor analyzed responses to items	246.94480895996094	356.49969482421875	9.0	185.35231018066406	96
from this global measure and obtained distinct	246.94480895996094	367.4994812011719	9.0	185.34059143066406	96
factors that corresponded to the anticipated	246.94480895996094	378.499267578125	9.0	185.2856903076172	96
components of belief in the ethical value of work,	246.94480895996094	389.4990539550781	9.0	185.3433074951172	96

empirically, the factors are strongly correlated	246.94480895996094	433.4981994628906	9.0	185.33702087402344	96
with the traditional measures of PWE. For	246.94480895996094	444.49798583984375	9.0	185.32798767089844	96

Garrett (1971). The ethical factor also correlated	246.94480895996094	488.4971923828125	9.0	185.33250427246094	96

(r = .27). The equity factor, not surprisingly given	246.9438934326172	521.49658203125	9.0	185.3153839111328	96
that it consisted largely of items not contained in	246.9429931640625	532.4963989257812	9.0	185.35501098632812	96

We expected that these components of PWE	254.943115234375	576.49560546875	9.0	177.33779907226562	96

in different ways. Concerning the sucker-effect	246.94300842285156	598.4952392578125	9.0	185.34239196777344	96

and a potential moderating role of the PWE,	49.606300354003906	70.50732421875	9.0	185.3379135131836	99
we had two contrasting hypotheses. On the one	49.606300354003906	81.50714111328125	9.0	185.37749481201172	99
hand, we speculated that people high in the	49.606300354003906	92.5069580078125	9.0	185.33882904052734	99

not show the sucker-effect because of their belief	49.606300354003906	114.506591796875	9.0	185.33609771728516	99
that hard work pays off in the long run. On the	49.606300354003906	125.50640869140625	9.0	185.34600067138672	99
other hand, people who subscribe strongly to	49.606300354003906	136.5062255859375	9.0	185.34058380126953	99
an equity norm should show the sucker-effect	49.606300354003906	147.50604248046875	9.0	185.33704376220703	99
in that they would react to the violation of the	49.606300354003906	158.505859375	9.0	185.32530975341797	99
equity norm in a situation where a partner is, by	49.606300354003906	169.505615234375	9.000030517578125	185.32711029052734	99
choice, coasting. Thus, we did not expect that	49.606300354003906	180.50543212890625	9.0	185.3352279663086	99
the global measure of PWE would moderate the	49.606300354003906	191.50521850585938	9.0	185.32891082763672	99

Our expectation regarding the moderating	57.60639953613281	213.50479125976562	9.0	177.33782958984375	99
inﬂuence of the instrumental component on the	49.606300354003906	224.50457763671875	9.0	185.34870147705078	99
sucker-effect was conﬁrmed. Participants who	49.606300354003906	235.50436401367188	9.0	185.33881378173828	99
believed in the long-range instrumental value of	49.60630798339844	246.504150390625	9.0	185.35140991210938	99
work were not affected by the reasons for their	49.60630798339844	257.5039367675781	9.0	185.3388214111328	99

less than the participant due to lack of ability	49.60630798339844	279.5035095214844	9.0	185.34059143066406	99
or to lack of motivation did not seem to matter	49.60630798339844	290.5032958984375	9.0	185.34332275390625	99
to them. In contrast, participants who did not	49.60630798339844	301.5030822753906	9.0	185.3397216796875	99
endorse the instrumental value of work exerted	49.60630798339844	312.50286865234375	9.0	185.3334197998047	99

rather than lazy. Somewhat surprisingly, these	49.60630798339844	334.50244140625	9.0	185.33700561523438	99
participants who were low on the instrumental	49.60630798339844	345.5022277832031	9.0	185.34243774414062	99

paired with an incapable partner than did the	49.60630798339844	367.5018005371094	9.0	185.34153747558594	99

component. Thus, it seems that people who	49.60630798339844	389.5013732910156	9.0	185.32797241210938	99
do not subscribe to the instrumental value of	49.60630798339844	400.50115966796875	9.0	185.33880615234375	99

ate incentives for high production. That is, for	49.60630798339844	433.5005187988281	9.0	185.34783935546875	99

compensate for less capable coworkers.	49.60630798339844	477.4997253417969	9.0	157.68899536132812	99
As predicted, participants who endorsed the	57.606407165527344	488.49951171875	9.0	177.34052276611328	99

a more self-focused belief in the long-range	246.94459533691406	70.49761962890625	9.0	185.34596252441406	104
beneﬁts of working hard and thus less responsive	246.94459533691406	81.4974365234375	9.0	185.32981872558594	104
to the social context. A strong endorsement	246.94461059570312	92.49725341796875	9.0	185.34420776367188	104
of the equity principle makes one particularly	246.94461059570312	103.4970703125	9.0	185.335205078125	104
vulnerable to the sucker-effect. Seemingly, the	246.94461059570312	114.49688720703125	9.0	185.33795166015625	104
psychological costs of exploitation are perceived	246.94461059570312	125.4967041015625	9.0	185.33071899414062	104
as high by people who believe in equity, and	246.94461059570312	136.49652099609375	9.0	185.3370361328125	104
thus they avoid being the sucker. Interestingly	246.94461059570312	147.496337890625	9.0	185.33880615234375	104
a strong belief in the ethical value of work also	246.94461059570312	158.49615478515625	9.0	185.34869384765625	104
makes one especially vulnerable to the sucker	246.94461059570312	169.49591064453125	9.000030517578125	185.34063720703125	104
effect, suggesting that the cost of compensating	246.94461059570312	180.4957275390625	9.0	185.337890625	104
for another’s laziness is too costly.	246.94461059570312	191.49551391601562	9.0	135.71102905273438	104
The free-rider effect does not seem to be	254.94471740722656	202.49530029296875	9.0	177.31800842285156	104
affected so strongly by the PWE components.	246.94461059570312	213.49508666992188	9.0	185.34060668945312	104
Although it appears that belief in the instrumental	246.94461059570312	224.494873046875	9.0	185.32888793945312	104
value of work may reduce free-riding, this	246.94461059570312	235.49465942382812	9.0	185.32080078125	104
evidence in our data is statistically weak. More-	246.94461059570312	246.49444580078125	9.0	185.34332275390625	104
over, we obtained no evidence that the ethical	246.94461059570312	257.4942321777344	9.0	185.34149169921875	104

riding. One possible reason is that people may	246.94461059570312	279.4938049316406	9.0	185.34420776367188	104

label free-riding. If they are not aware that they	246.94461059570312	301.4933776855469	9.0	185.3397216796875	104
are working less hard in a collective effort, their	246.94461059570312	312.4931640625	9.0	185.3621826171875	104
beliefs about the work and equity may not be	246.94461059570312	323.4929504394531	9.0	185.34060668945312	104
relevant. Moreover, it is clear that motivation	246.94461059570312	334.49273681640625	9.0	185.3424072265625	104
loss in a free-rider situation is less of an affective	246.94461059570312	345.4925231933594	9.0	185.3370361328125	104
reaction than in a sucker effect condition. From	246.94461059570312	356.4923095703125	9.0	185.3477783203125	104
a certain perspective, free-riding seems rational.	246.94461059570312	367.4920959472656	9.0	185.34060668945312	104
That is, reducing effort in team situations after	246.94461059570312	378.49188232421875	9.0	185.34600830078125	104

well could be an adaptive approach to collective	246.94461059570312	400.491455078125	9.0	185.326171875	104
endeavors. In the long run, it is functional to	246.94461059570312	411.4912414550781	9.0	185.33880615234375	104

In conclusion, we examined individual dif-	254.94471740722656	466.490234375	9.0	177.3360137939453	104

sucker. There is also a tendency for these people	246.94461059570312	565.4884033203125	9.0	185.34954833984375	104
