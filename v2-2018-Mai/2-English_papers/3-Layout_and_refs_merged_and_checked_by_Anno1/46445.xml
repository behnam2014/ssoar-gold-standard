Social support is often described as an exclusively positively acting factor. Its absence is said	73.68000030517578	252.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	447.5168991088867	10
to mean negative consequences for individuals. This article shows that the supply and	73.68000030517578	280.38360595703125	12.00042724609375	411.4997787475586	10
dependence of intergenerational social support can have negative consequences and pertains	73.68000030517578	307.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	443.14952850341797	10
to persisting unequal gender roles and a gendered division of labor in relationships. Based on	73.68000030517578	335.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	446.78099822998047	10

Regarding studies of family and gender sociology, Germany is a special case. Its division	73.68000030517578	112.383544921875	12.00042724609375	428.8499984741211	20
after WWII induced the establishment of two different social and economic systems. The	73.68000030517578	139.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	428.2380905151367	20
territory of eastern Germany was the sovereign, socialist state of the German Democratic	73.68000030517578	167.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	427.40486907958984	20
Republic (GDR), the western German parts formed the sovereign democratic state of the	73.68000030517578	195.18353271484375	12.00042724609375	425.52831268310547	20
Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), which implemented market economy. After the	73.68000030517578	222.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	410.47737884521484	20
collapse of the Communist states in 1989/90 the existing political and economic structure of	73.68000030517578	250.38360595703125	12.00042724609375	442.18041229248047	20
the FRG was superimposed on the territory of the GDR. This is important for studying	73.68000030517578	277.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	415.73668670654297	20
gender relationships because the FRG and the GDR were different and contrary concerning	73.68000030517578	305.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	438.55101776123047	20
family regimes, gender relations and state policies towards marriage and fertility (Pfau-	73.68000030517578	333.1835632324219	12.00042724609375	419.86962127685547	20
Effinger and Geissler 2002; Salles 2006). Even today social science research finds	73.68000030517578	360.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	395.15108489990234	20
remarkable differences between both regions (Huinink, Kreyenfeld and Trappe 2012; Krause	73.68000030517578	388.383544921875	12.00042724609375	446.75743865966797	20
and Ostner 2010), e.g. women from eastern Germany are much younger at their first	73.68000030517578	415.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	404.4380111694336	20
childbirth, childlessness is less common for them, being unmarried and single mothers are	73.68000030517578	443.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	432.38362884521484	20
more common (Konietzka and Kreyenfeld 2010). Also differences in the gender-specific	73.68000030517578	471.1835632324219	12.00042724609375	426.0009078979492	20
division of labor in families are still obvious, but whether underlying gender roles	73.68000030517578	498.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	392.9045639038086	20
differences have persisted or even intensified after the reunification – or whether	73.68000030517578	526.383544921875	12.00042724609375	387.44747161865234	20
equalization between East and West is happening, remains disputed (Kahlert 2010).	73.68000030517578	554.1035766601562	12.00042724609375	401.8817672729492	20
Explanations for persisting and changing conceptions of gender roles and the division of	73.68000030517578	591.54345703125	12.000457763671875	424.77819061279297	21
labor in relationships in eastern and western Germany mostly involve basic political	73.68000030517578	619.1435546875	12.000457763671875	403.6146469116211	21
conditions, changes to the labor market and different cultural concepts or socialization	73.68000030517578	646.7435302734375	12.000457763671875	414.55428314208984	21
experiences. Our article discusses a further factor, which we feel has not been considered	73.68000030517578	674.343505859375	12.000457763671875	428.0796432495117	21
sufficiently: the different structure, availability and claiming of intergenerational support.	73.68000030517578	701.9435424804688	12.000450134277344	429.5884323120117	21
Accordingly, the organization of intergenerational relationships of young adults in their	73.68000030517578	729.5435180664062	12.000450134277344	420.4252243041992	21

arrangements are of our particular interest. We assume, that the bigger supply of	73.68000030517578	102.423583984375	12.00042724609375	385.81529998779297	23
intergenerational support of grandparents for their children and grandchildren and an alleged	73.68000030517578	130.0235595703125	12.00042724609375	444.9557418823242	23
dependence on these transfers in western Germany is especially responsible for the	73.68000030517578	157.62359619140625	12.00042724609375	398.21944427490234	23
transmission of traditional gender roles. Qualitative interviews with young adults and their	73.68000030517578	185.22357177734375	12.00042724609375	434.5303268432617	23
parents, which were conducted 2004/5, constitute the basis of our investigation.	73.68000030517578	212.94354248046875	12.00042724609375	382.35631561279297	23
Next we introduce the different family models in eastern and western Germany and	73.68000030517578	250.38360595703125	12.00042724609375	400.4012680053711	24
subsequently examine explanatory approaches concerning the emergence and development	73.68000030517578	277.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	437.0599594116211	24
of these models. Then we explain the theoretical concept of intergenerational exchange	73.68000030517578	305.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	418.49092864990234	24

question regarding the connection between intergenerational support and reproduction of	73.68000030517578	360.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	426.9424362182617	24
gender inequalities. Our data and methods are introduced in the empirical section.	73.68000030517578	388.383544921875	12.00042724609375	392.9351119995117	24
Subsequently we present summarized results and two case studies from eastern and western	73.68000030517578	415.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	440.4785690307617	24

Concerning family models, the GDR and the FRG exhibited until the 1980s a development	73.68000030517578	556.383544921875	12.00042724609375	436.56383514404297	26

The supply of nationwide full-day childcare enabled many eastern German mothers to	73.68000030517578	240.423583984375	12.00042724609375	413.5556869506836	37

Additionally to these explanations we would like to examine persistence and processes of	73.68000030517578	315.66357421875	12.00042724609375	429.7502975463867	43

in some areas, where hence the younger generation probably communicates orientational	73.68000030517578	581.5835571289062	12.000442504882812	426.8429183959961	61
knowledge to the elders. Concerning East-West comparison two things seem conceivable: a	73.68000030517578	609.1834716796875	12.000457763671875	440.42650604248047	61

attitudes and behavior from GDR times (many employed mothers, compatibility of family	73.68000030517578	691.9835205078125	12.000457763671875	432.67760467529297	61

According to Masche a higher family orientation as a GDR relic is not necessarily the cause	73.68000030517578	277.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	441.3429489135742	64
for stronger generational bonds, but the higher concentration of problems (e.g.	73.68000030517578	305.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	376.2301559448242	64

Regarding family models and gender roles our knowledge about precise transmissions	73.68000030517578	370.8635559082031	12.00042724609375	414.17733001708984	65

Further, there is little knowledge, regarding the role of (expected) support, of how these	73.68000030517578	426.0635986328125	12.00042724609375	421.17623138427734	65

To answer these questions we revert to qualitative interviews with young adults from eastern	73.68000030517578	112.383544921875	12.00042724609375	445.5507125854492	68

division of labor is not necessarily completely egalitarian though. However, both partners	73.68000030517578	556.383544921875	12.00042724609375	430.14192962646484	88

Contrary to this material support plays an irregular role with the interviewees from Rostock.	73.68000030517578	139.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	442.46410369873047	110
They benefit less from parental support. Access to material support is also unimportant when	73.68000030517578	167.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	446.5862350463867	110

There are also important differences concerning the availability of practical support. The	73.68000030517578	232.86358642578125	12.00042724609375	425.78096771240234	111

Many childless Lübeck interviewees thinking about parenthood expect their potential	73.68000030517578	528.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	409.5739059448242	113

The Rostock interviewees assume that grandparents’ support alone is insufficient to enable	73.68000030517578	167.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	436.16841888427734	118
an employment for the mother. They do not expect regular support; oftentimes they do not	73.68000030517578	195.18353271484375	12.00042724609375	434.1144332885742	118
receive it since both grandparents work full-time or live far away. Even if a grandparent is	73.68000030517578	222.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	433.0992660522461	118
early-retired or unemployed, regular help with childcare is not expected. However, parents	73.68000030517578	250.38360595703125	12.00042724609375	434.9891891479492	118
can rely on their parents’ help in emergencies if those live nearby and the relationship to	73.68000030517578	277.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	424.36287689208984	118

Cognitive support for instance refers to children orienting their own behavior by the	73.68000030517578	343.2635498046875	12.00042724609375	403.1528549194336	119
attitudes, behavior, values and experiences of their parents. This is particularly apparent with	73.68000030517578	370.8635559082031	12.00042724609375	446.17931365966797	119
the western German interviewees. They explicitly justify their positive evaluation of the	73.68000030517578	398.46356201171875	12.00042724609375	422.52571868896484	119

Concerning this issue and the perception of children as “calculated risk”, the attitudes and	73.68000030517578	611.58349609375	12.000457763671875	431.1711959838867	121
behavior of the interviewed young adults and their parents coincide strongly. Children are	73.68000030517578	639.1834716796875	12.000457763671875	431.45223236083984	121
considered potentially threatening to material wealth if there was not a certain standard of	73.68000030517578	666.7835693359375	12.000457763671875	430.82433319091797	121
material security established beforehand. Before starting a family, parents (G1) from Lübeck	73.68000030517578	694.383544921875	12.000457763671875	445.5078659057617	121
expect from their children first to finish vocational training, enter into employment, for the	73.68000030517578	721.9835815429688	12.000450134277344	435.3846664428711	121
husband to find a reliable employment and earn a certain material basis. This attitude is	73.68000030517578	749.5835571289062	12.000450134277344	419.6723861694336	121

shared by the children (G2), who thus mostly have specific ideas about how and when to	73.68000030517578	74.82354736328125	12.00042724609375	425.7977828979492	123
start a family. Shared is also the ideal of a mother who above all cares for their children and	73.68000030517578	102.423583984375	12.00042724609375	440.7816696166992	123
a rather negative evaluation of full-time employed “career-obsessed” mothers.	73.68000030517578	130.0235595703125	12.00042724609375	375.5546188354492	123
Conspicuously, interviewees from Lübeck hardly challenge “traditional” gender roles and	73.68000030517578	157.62359619140625	12.00042724609375	431.08797454833984	123

Only some interviewees from Lübeck refer to societal change (e.g. educational expansion,	73.68000030517578	222.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	433.2675094604492	124
pluralism of lifestyles and family structures, increase of instable employment) and resulting	73.68000030517578	250.38360595703125	12.00042724609375	439.9045944213867	124
differences to their parents.The Rostock interviewees and their parents show congruence	73.68000030517578	277.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	425.48897552490234	124
concerning the attitude that parenthood is natural and can be arranged flexibly. Both also	73.68000030517578	305.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	426.4305953979492	124
view employment of mothers positively. Partially, the own parents are also seen as role	73.68000030517578	333.1835632324219	12.00042724609375	418.7072982788086	124

My parents both have their career, have made arrangements. And they have	109.08000183105469	398.46356201171875	12.00042724609375	362.6879119873047	125
divided the work. That’s my requirement to a relationship…Well, sure, my	109.08000183105469	426.0635986328125	12.00042724609375	360.5153045654297	125

Oftentimes the issue is raised that things common in the GDR are not transferrable to today’s	73.68000030517578	546.423583984375	12.00042724609375	447.68859100341797	126

It’s not like people “take their time“, they are forced to get children later. At	109.08000183105469	611.58349609375	12.000457763671875	365.94993591308594	127

finish vocational training first, before one can take the time for children. Then	109.08000183105469	666.7835693359375	12.000457763671875	374.5045928955078	127
they say, especially with any academic higher degrees, I have to make my	109.08000183105469	694.383544921875	12.000457763671875	355.27708435058594	127
career first, get used to working first, it’s the women after all who get the	109.08000183105469	721.9835815429688	12.000450134277344	351.1230010986328	127

Insofar “they don’t take their time” – they are forced to organize time	109.08000183105469	74.82354736328125	12.00042724609375	333.80039978027344	129

This quote implies that the eastern German interviewees also experience the necessity to	73.68000030517578	139.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	424.4811019897461	130
consider a stronger sequencing of life events – first career, then children. However, speaking	73.68000030517578	167.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	445.3434371948242	130
of “West-Germanization” here would be wrong. Neither intrinsic motivation nor the inner	73.68000030517578	195.18353271484375	12.00042724609375	431.83495330810547	130
need for security – which apply to the western German interviewees – make such sequencing	73.68000030517578	222.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	447.1636276245117	130
desirable. It is rather an externally imposed “enforcement” which makes an orientation	73.68000030517578	250.38360595703125	12.00042724609375	416.50460052490234	130
towards occupational careers appear necessary, since otherwise mothers cannot realize full-	73.68000030517578	277.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	439.56554412841797	130
time employment, which is taken for granted. Hence, longer career breaks after giving birth	73.68000030517578	305.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	439.6947555541992	130
or part-time employment do not indicate a voluntary approximation to a “western German	73.68000030517578	333.1835632324219	12.00042724609375	432.5348129272461	130

concerning all other types. Material help and practical support regarding childcare are	73.68000030517578	453.66357421875	12.00042724609375	411.85201263427734	131
increasingly provided or expected by the western German interviewees. Cognitive support is	73.68000030517578	481.2635498046875	12.00042724609375	444.5408248901367	131
received by interviewees from both towns, contents differ entirely though. In Lübeck	73.68000030517578	508.86358642578125	12.00042724609375	408.2016830444336	131
children are ill-reputed by both generations as calculated risk and the male breadwinner	73.68000030517578	536.4635620117188	12.00042724609375	420.5007553100586	131
model alongside the ideal of the caring mother is passed on. In Rostock parents pass on the	73.68000030517578	564.0635986328125	12.00042724609375	436.90026092529297	131

To examine how intergenerational relationships and support affect the conveying of gender	73.68000030517578	656.823486328125	12.000457763671875	438.14891815185547	132
roles, we have contrasted the narratives of female egos (G2) with the ones of their mothers	73.68000030517578	684.423583984375	12.000457763671875	435.1613082885742	132
(G1). Two case examples featuring young women from Lübeck and Rostock illustrate	73.68000030517578	712.0235595703125	12.000450134277344	413.17134857177734	132

Both cases feature young women with each one child. The case illustration focuses primarily	73.68000030517578	177.66357421875	12.00042724609375	445.9017868041992	136
on narratives (from G2) concerning the decision for parenthood, labor division in the	73.68000030517578	205.2635498046875	12.00042724609375	407.7408981323242	136

analyzed the narratives of the respective mother concentrating on statements concerning	73.68000030517578	260.46356201171875	12.00042724609375	423.2928695678711	136

Lisa is 29 years old at the time of the interview, has a nine month old child and is on	73.68000030517578	390.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	405.3062973022461	138
maternity leave. Concerning her lifestyle and thoughts she represents a typical case from	73.68000030517578	418.383544921875	12.00042724609375	425.3187789916992	138
Lübeck. She is married to a public officer older by four years, has a higher qualification and	73.68000030517578	445.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	441.70726776123047	138
is just starting her civil service career. She maintains a good relationship to her parents and	73.68000030517578	473.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	436.62828826904297	138
mother-in-law, who live in the same town, including close and frequent contact.	73.68000030517578	501.3035888671875	12.00042724609375	383.68636322021484	138
Lisbeth, Lisa’s mother, is 55 years old, housewife, mother of two and also married to a	73.68000030517578	538.8635864257812	12.00042724609375	416.7830123901367	139
public officer. After completing her vocational training and working shortly in her job she	73.68000030517578	566.4635620117188	12.00042724609375	432.5365219116211	139
became pregnant at age 21. Her husband was already 31 and public officer. As planned they	73.68000030517578	594.0635986328125	12.000457763671875	442.2830123901367	139
married first and had the first child, Lisa’s older sister then. Lisbeth has been a housewife	73.68000030517578	621.54345703125	12.000457763671875	429.50606536865234	139
until Lisa was three years old, then she worked part-time for 12 hours a week.	73.68000030517578	649.2635498046875	12.000457763671875	373.9222946166992	139
Lisa was a lot older than her mother at her first pregnancy, but she and her partner were in	73.68000030517578	686.823486328125	12.000457763671875	432.5431137084961	140
the same biographic phase: Lisa and partner got their first child after completing vocational	73.68000030517578	714.423583984375	12.000450134277344	438.9631881713867	140
training and achieving a reliable occupation. Their division of labor was mostly egalitarian	73.68000030517578	742.0235595703125	12.000450134277344	435.5223617553711	140

before the child. Ever since Lisa is responsible for child and household and her husband acts	73.68000030517578	74.82354736328125	12.00042724609375	443.9148483276367	142
as main breadwinner. Unlike her mother, Lisa seeks part-time employment once the child	73.68000030517578	102.423583984375	12.00042724609375	429.6622543334961	142
turns one. Full-time employment is out of question in the near future.	73.68000030517578	130.1435546875	12.00042724609375	332.3218307495117	142
Lisbeth supports Lisa’s attitude. It is important for her that mothers “are there for their	73.68000030517578	167.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	415.0667037963867	143
children”, but also that women earn their own living in emergencies (she particularly thinks	73.68000030517578	195.18353271484375	12.00042724609375	439.8189010620117	143
of risk to divorce) and thus should learn a good profession and refrain from interrupting	73.68000030517578	222.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	421.2478256225586	143
work for too long. Therefore she has offered regular support in childcare and they have	73.68000030517578	250.38360595703125	12.00042724609375	418.14183807373047	143
arranged that she and Lisa’s mother-in-law will share providing this support, once Lisa	73.68000030517578	277.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	417.56356048583984	143
returns to work:	73.68000030517578	305.70355224609375	12.00042724609375	76.55123138427734	143
With Lisa, her mother-in-law and I want to share it, Lisa wants to return to	109.08000183105469	343.2635498046875	12.00042724609375	358.39295959472656	144
work in May, twelve hours, then one day the one mother takes and another	109.08000183105469	370.8635559082031	12.00042724609375	358.92921447753906	144
day the other mother, that’s okay, nowadays without grandma and grandpa	109.08000183105469	398.46356201171875	12.00042724609375	359.19850158691406	144
one can’t get children anymore. (Lisbeth)	109.08000183105469	426.1835632324219	12.00042724609375	199.2209014892578	144
Thus Lisbeth clings to traditional gender roles, but also enables, due to her childcare	73.68000030517578	463.62353515625	12.00042724609375	404.8950424194336	145
commitment, a modernization of this family arrangement. Providing support is also	73.68000030517578	491.22357177734375	12.00042724609375	400.66390228271484	145
connected to propagating attitudes and values. Lisbeth describes her mother image:	73.68000030517578	518.9435424804688	12.00042724609375	399.64537811279297	145
I favor, that mothers are there for their children, but they should also work, if	109.08000183105469	556.383544921875	12.00042724609375	370.16758728027344	146
possible not the whole day. As for me children come first before work.	109.08000183105469	583.9835815429688	12.000442504882812	339.86607360839844	146
(Lisbeth)	109.08000183105469	611.7034912109375	12.000457763671875	43.94169616699219	146
Thanks to the social support via her parents, Lisa seemingly takes this combination of family	73.68000030517578	649.1435546875	12.000457763671875	446.4530563354492	147
and work for granted. She refuses extra-familial and institutional childcare, because the	73.68000030517578	676.7435302734375	12.000457763671875	419.4482955932617	147
family provides “better” care and ought to be preferred, an attitude shared by many western	73.68000030517578	704.3435668945312	12.000450134277344	439.49181365966797	147
German interviewees. She also senses certain social pressure and knows,	73.68000030517578	732.0635986328125	12.000450134277344	349.48668670654297	147

If one chooses a nanny, the parents would feel offended. (Lisa)	109.08000183105469	74.94354248046875	12.00042724609375	302.60523986816406	149
Hence, the parents offering social help is also linked to expectations in return, specifically	73.68000030517578	112.383544921875	12.00042724609375	432.20516204833984	150
refraining from “giving away” the own child to “external care”, as well as from working	73.68000030517578	139.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	424.2444076538086	150
fulltime and havint to rely on all-day care.	73.68000030517578	167.70355224609375	12.00042724609375	202.3947982788086	150

Ronja is 29 years old and has a four year old child. She achieved a higher qualification and	73.68000030517578	242.82354736328125	12.00042724609375	436.4950180053711	152
has a full-time, although temporary, employment. She is unmarried, but is in a partnership	73.68000030517578	270.423583984375	12.00042724609375	432.9879379272461	152
with the child’s father. He also achieved a higher qualification and has a permanent full-time	73.68000030517578	298.0235595703125	12.00042724609375	445.6639938354492	152
contract. Renate, Ronja’s mother, is 54 years old, married, has two children and works full-	73.68000030517578	325.62353515625	12.000457763671875	438.8043746948242	152
time in a well-paid ambitious job which corresponds to her university degree.	73.68000030517578	353.34356689453125	12.00042724609375	371.7975082397461	152
When speaking about organizing childcare Ronja’s parents are not mentioned. Ronja and her	73.68000030517578	390.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	446.2588424682617	153
husband take turns. The rather egalitarian role allocation has prevailed since childbirth. They	73.68000030517578	418.383544921875	12.00042724609375	446.0836715698242	153
practice the two-income model and trust public childcare facilities. Ronja says: “My son has	73.68000030517578	445.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	443.25096893310547	153
gone to kindergarten since he turned one”. They are independent from their parent’s support	73.68000030517578	473.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	442.4768600463867	153
and do not expect it.	73.68000030517578	501.3035888671875	12.00042724609375	97.64427947998047	153
There are remarkable similarities between Renate and Ronja concerning labor division in a	73.68000030517578	538.8635864257812	12.00042724609375	436.60323333740234	154
partnership. Answering the interviewer’s question if she could generally understand that	73.68000030517578	566.4635620117188	12.00042724609375	423.6320114135742	154
highly educated people are fixed on their occupational career and voluntarily relinquish	73.68000030517578	594.0635986328125	12.000457763671875	420.14681243896484	154
having children, Renate says she has “always worked (…), I have never stayed at home”, she	73.68000030517578	621.54345703125	12.000457763671875	447.02257537841797	154
“did not take maternity leave”, and still they shared the remaining time with the children.	73.68000030517578	649.1435546875	12.000457763671875	427.83785247802734	154
Accordingly, both her children did not suffer from her occupational life and she is pleased	73.68000030517578	676.7435302734375	12.000457763671875	432.73876190185547	154
with how her children grew up and how they are living. This also applies when she had to	73.68000030517578	704.3435668945312	12.000450134277344	431.10396575927734	154
travel in her job and was often absent at home – then her husband took over: “When I wasn’t	73.68000030517578	731.9435424804688	12.000450134277344	445.82518768310547	154

there, he was for the children. That’s somewhere manageable, if one wants to”. Renate’s and	73.68000030517578	74.82354736328125	12.00042724609375	445.0757369995117	156
her husband’s parents were unable to help, because all four were working. The availability of	73.68000030517578	102.423583984375	12.00042724609375	447.82994842529297	156
public childcare facilities helped them a lot. Ronja and her partner have a similar	73.68000030517578	130.0235595703125	12.00042724609375	387.9493637084961	156
arrangement. Both work and equally care for their child. Renate’s influence on Ronja and	73.68000030517578	157.62359619140625	12.00042724609375	430.1968002319336	156
her support is rather emotional and cognitive. Ronja adopted her quasi-natural attitude	73.68000030517578	185.22357177734375	12.00042724609375	413.9719467163086	156
towards children from Renate, i.e. children are part of life. The cognitive orientation exceeds	73.68000030517578	212.82354736328125	12.00042724609375	445.34410858154297	156
the propagation of functioning, inelastic behavioral patterns and role models. It is more	73.68000030517578	240.423583984375	12.00042724609375	418.5378952026367	156
flexible and manifests itself in a type of arranging ability:	73.68000030517578	268.1435546875	12.00042724609375	276.06417083740234	156
Fortunately, [Ronja] completed her studies almost in the standard period,	109.08000183105469	305.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	350.83692932128906	157
which was tough, but couldn’t get her traineeship then, that takes long, before	109.08000183105469	333.1835632324219	12.00042724609375	373.68544006347656	157
it’s your turn. She said, then she gets her child in between, I thought that was	109.08000183105469	360.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	369.8913116455078	157
great. I think we partially exemplified this, that it’s not that difficult with a	109.08000183105469	388.383544921875	12.00042724609375	358.3249053955078	157
child. They have other problems than us, with security. Housing is not an	109.08000183105469	415.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	351.55030822753906	157
issue, but work, career opportunities…but both are, my son-in-law, well they	109.08000183105469	443.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	370.13917541503906	157
are not married, today it’s also not that anymore…but they both got a job, and	109.08000183105469	471.1835632324219	12.00042724609375	374.6011199951172	157
this without problems after studying. (Renate)	109.08000183105469	498.903564453125	12.00042724609375	221.21095275878906	157
This reveals that Renate consciously tries to pass on the cognitive certainty to be able to	73.68000030517578	536.4635620117188	12.00042724609375	422.0961227416992	158
actually overcome such difficulties and trust that this harms neither parents nor children.	73.68000030517578	564.1835327148438	12.00042724609375	424.78234100341797	158
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION	212.8800048828125	639.54345703125	12.000457763671875	169.50216674804688	159
Our interviewees from Rostock and Lübeck demonstrate important differences concerning	73.68000030517578	676.7435302734375	12.000457763671875	434.33492279052734	160
personal preferences and actually practiced gender arrangements in a partnership. The	73.68000030517578	704.3435668945312	12.000450134277344	412.8288803100586	160
western German interviewees do opine egalitarian attitudes concerning women participating	73.68000030517578	731.9435424804688	12.000450134277344	442.8914108276367	160
27	510.239990234375	780.6469116210938	12.000450134
in occupational life and labor division in partnerships, but in most cases only when there are	73.68000030517578	74.82354736328125	12.00042724609375	442.52709197998047	162
no children, yet. Upon the birth of the first child the male breadwinner model, exemplified	73.68000030517578	102.423583984375	12.00042724609375	434.30306243896484	162
by the grandparents, is usually adopted. This model is partially modernized by	73.68000030517578	130.0235595703125	12.00042724609375	376.41551971435547	162
acknowledging that women, mothers respectively, are needed to participate in gainful	73.68000030517578	157.62359619140625	12.00042724609375	411.10201263427734	162
employment. Besides insufficient public childcare, the traditional ideal of a mother, which is	73.68000030517578	185.22357177734375	12.00042724609375	444.83702850341797	162
internalized by our interviewees, disfavors full-time employment. Mothers are widely	73.68000030517578	212.82354736328125	12.00042724609375	411.7572250366211	162
regarded as the nature’s best guardian who fends for a good development of the child. Many	73.68000030517578	240.423583984375	12.00042724609375	443.4033737182617	162
women struggle to reconcile their wish for children and their mother image with their	73.68000030517578	268.0235595703125	12.00042724609375	410.15355682373047	162
conceptions concerning professional life. They are unsure whether and when to get a child or	73.68000030517578	295.62359619140625	12.00042724609375	446.9688034057617	162
relinquish having children in favor of practicing their profession.	73.68000030517578	323.34356689453125	12.00042724609375	311.51158905029297	162
An egalitarian partnership arrangement, where women return to full-time employment after	73.68000030517578	360.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	438.81127166748047	163
getting a child, childcare is organized cooperatively and public institutions are trusted, is	73.68000030517578	388.383544921875	12.00042724609375	425.13631439208984	163
much more common and natural for the eastern German interviewees. Deviations from the	73.68000030517578	415.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	434.85094451904297	163
two-income model are mainly caused by unemployment or vocational training and less by	73.68000030517578	443.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	432.76073455810547	163
refusal or reservations regarding institutional childcare.	73.68000030517578	471.3035888671875	12.00042724609375	265.71346282958984	163
So, how do intergenerational relationships affect the passing on (and transition) of gender	73.68000030517578	508.86358642578125	12.00042724609375	430.20433807373047	164
roles and partnership arrangements?	73.68000030517578	536.5835571289062	12.00042724609375	173.58358001708984	164
We demonstrated that western and eastern Germans usually maintain close relationships,	73.68000030517578	574.0235595703125	12.000442504882812	426.9602279663086	165
which are characterized by frequent interactions and mutual support, to their parents and	73.68000030517578	601.62353515625	12.000457763671875	424.6926498413086	165
parents-in-law. However, differences concerning the attributed importance of and access to	73.68000030517578	629.2235107421875	12.000457763671875	437.57747650146484	165
certain types of support were evident.	73.68000030517578	656.9434814453125	12.000457763671875	180.50615692138672	165
The western German interviewees benefit from more frequent and higher material transfers.	73.68000030517578	694.383544921875	12.000457763671875	441.1448287963867	166
Financial security is also an especially important precondition for starting a family (cf. also	73.68000030517578	721.9835815429688	12.000450134277344	437.75292205810547	166
Author YEAR). Thus the interviewed young adults attach value to the opportunity of	73.68000030517578	749.5835571289062	12.000450134277344	408.17467498779297	166
28	510.239990234375	780.6469116210938	12.000450134277344	11.241455078125	167
receiving material support from their parents. This also applies essentially to practical	73.68000030517578	74.82354736328125	12.00042724609375	411.75569915771484	168
support in childcare. The grandparent’s help is necessary because of insufficient public	73.68000030517578	102.423583984375	12.00042724609375	417.8321762084961	168
childcare possibilities and unwanted public childcare for little children or longer periods of	73.68000030517578	130.0235595703125	12.00042724609375	436.5485153198242	168
time since external care is evaluated negatively. These close intergenerational relationships	73.68000030517578	157.62359619140625	12.00042724609375	437.6438522338867	168
provide certain material and practical support (most likely from grandparents to parents), but	73.68000030517578	185.22357177734375	12.00042724609375	445.5011520385742	168
also pass on or negotiate oriental knowledge. Concerning the importance of support related	73.68000030517578	212.82354736328125	12.00042724609375	437.42488861083984	168
to childcare, the western German interviewees feel in a way dependent on their parent’s help	73.68000030517578	240.423583984375	12.00042724609375	444.69982147216797	168
who also possess considerable power to sanction if their children act outside their	73.68000030517578	268.0235595703125	12.00042724609375	391.21617889404297	168
expectations. The social trade-off simultaneously constitutes interdependency (Blau 1964),	73.68000030517578	295.62359619140625	12.00042724609375	436.5284957885742	168
whereby the grandparents emphatically formulate certain role expectations to their children,	73.68000030517578	323.22357177734375	12.00042724609375	441.31627655029297	168
especially their daughters who ought to take care of the children primarily. Since most	73.68000030517578	350.8235778808594	12.00042724609375	414.61153411865234	168
grandparents strongly opine a male breadwinner model, a modernization is limited. Indeed,	73.68000030517578	378.423583984375	12.00042724609375	437.9208297729492	168
the two-income model including children is unimaginable for most of our western German	73.68000030517578	406.0235595703125	12.00042724609375	435.1622543334961	168
interviewees or even offensively refused by both generations. However, even the	73.68000030517578	433.62353515625	12.00042724609375	388.4369125366211	168
interviewees in Lübeck have undergone change and both generations emphasize preference	73.68000030517578	461.22357177734375	12.00042724609375	438.3555221557617	168
of a modernized breadwinner model where the mother works part-time. Especially parents of	73.68000030517578	488.8235778808594	12.00042724609375	446.8456344604492	168
daughters are aware that partnerships and also occupations lack stability compared to their	73.68000030517578	516.423583984375	12.00042724609375	433.8030014038086	168
times. Thus they often urge their daughter to learn a profession and return to their occupation	73.68000030517578	544.0235595703125	12.00042724609375	447.1888961791992	168
part-time shortly after the birth. For this they offer support concerning childcare.	73.68000030517578	571.7435913085938	12.00042724609375	386.8123092651367	168
Contrary, the access to comparably small material and partially practical support does not	73.68000030517578	609.1834716796875	12.000457763671875	430.12899017333984	169
prevent the eastern German interviewees from starting a family: they do not necessarily	73.68000030517578	636.7835693359375	12.000457763671875	420.72994232177734	169
require a high degree of financial security. Regular childcare via the grandparents is also	73.68000030517578	664.383544921875	12.000457763671875	424.9846420288086	169
considered unnecessary, because most interviewees perceive sufficient public care facilities	73.68000030517578	691.9835205078125	12.000457763671875	439.9557418823242	169
and adequate care. In comparison to the western German interviewees they do not	73.68000030517578	719.5835571289062	12.000450134277344	393.41942596435547	169
experience such strong dependency on the grandparents. Hence, the eastern German	73.68000030517578	747.1835327148438	12.000450134277344	403.74385833740234	169
29	510.239990234375	780.6469116210938	12.000450134277344	11.241455078125	170
interviewees enjoy more leeway following gender models, partnership arrangement	73.68000030517578	74.82354736328125	12.00042724609375	400.8336410522461	171
respectively, different from their parents. Originally we assumed that, due to the societal	73.68000030517578	102.423583984375	12.00042724609375	424.8009567260742	171
turnaround, orientational knowledge of the grandparents in eastern Germany had become	73.68000030517578	130.0235595703125	12.00042724609375	428.12068939208984	171
obsolete. However, the interviews in Rostock showed that the younger generation shares	73.68000030517578	157.62359619140625	12.00042724609375	425.5659408569336	171
many beliefs and values with their parents: the two-income model with children and flexibly	73.68000030517578	185.22357177734375	12.00042724609375	444.5110397338867	171
managing family and professional life is still natural, coping with adverse circumstances is	73.68000030517578	212.82354736328125	12.00042724609375	435.5044479370117	171
passed on from generation to generation. Thus it is important that changed circumstances do	73.68000030517578	240.423583984375	12.00042724609375	443.00292205810547	171
not conclude outdated orientational knowledge. The type of passed on orientational	73.68000030517578	268.0235595703125	12.00042724609375	400.1917953491211	171
knowledge ought to be subject to research. We claim the eastern German interviewees are	73.68000030517578	295.62359619140625	12.00042724609375	431.79537200927734	171
better prepared for the current situation in the unified Germany – e.g. difficult employment	73.68000030517578	323.22357177734375	12.00042724609375	436.78136444091797	171
situation, problems arranging family and career – because both partners show more	73.68000030517578	350.8235778808594	12.00042724609375	399.76097869873047	171
flexibility, pragmatism and willingness to work full-time. Part-time employment or non-	73.68000030517578	378.423583984375	12.00042724609375	424.66466522216797	171
working mothers are possible, an arrangement which is less opposed by grandparents in	73.68000030517578	406.0235595703125	12.00042724609375	421.60347747802734	171
eastern Germany than the two-income model in western Germany. For this reason the	73.68000030517578	433.62353515625	12.00042724609375	411.4416732788086	171
eastern German interviewees are also less likely to respond to the mentioned difficulties with	73.68000030517578	461.22357177734375	12.00042724609375	446.8809127807617	171
postponing the decision for parenthood or relinquish having children. Although the eastern	73.68000030517578	488.8235778808594	12.00042724609375	435.92598724365234	171
Germans hardly raise issues concerning gender equality, one must record that in practice	73.68000030517578	516.423583984375	12.00042724609375	425.43859100341797	171
women still contribute more to chores and childcare.	73.68000030517578	544.1436157226562	12.00042724609375	252.56829071044922	171
Our data does not suffice to answer the question concerning change or persistency and	73.68000030517578	581.5835571289062	12.000442504882812	414.73226165771484	172
reproduction of unequal gender roles and partnership arrangements clearly, least of all	73.68000030517578	609.1834716796875	12.000457763671875	413.84871673583984	172
representatively for eastern and western Germany. The investigation of people with a low	73.68000030517578	636.7835693359375	12.000457763671875	430.1789779663086	172
educational level would be especially interesting, as our sample lacked those. Many factors	73.68000030517578	664.383544921875	12.000457763671875	437.80135345458984	172
caused the still existing differences between eastern and western Germany, which	73.68000030517578	691.9835205078125	12.000457763671875	392.3491744995117	172
subsequently enforce the reproduction of gender inequalities and traditional family models:	73.68000030517578	719.5835571289062	12.000450134277344	438.4036178588867	172
the fiscal system, labor market structures, personal preferences, cultural aspects etc.	73.68000030517578	747.1835327148438	12.000450134277344	401.7860641479492	172

However, the availability, (alleged) dependency and actual exchange of social support and	73.68000030517578	74.82354736328125	12.00042724609375	434.2132797241211	174
orientational knowledge between grandparents and parents also play an important role. We	73.68000030517578	102.423583984375	12.00042724609375	436.53096771240234	174
hereby claim the mentioning of this insufficiently considered factor.	73.68000030517578	130.1435546875	12.00042724609375	326.8259811401367	174
To formulate a concluding thesis: Receiving cognitive orientation from the grandparents	73.68000030517578	167.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	424.5042953491211	175
causes the passing on of traditional role models, which the younger parent generation orients	73.68000030517578	195.18353271484375	12.00042724609375	445.20128631591797	175
itself by. This intensifies if there are dependencies concerning material and/or practical	73.68000030517578	222.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	417.9128646850586	175
support. However, the passed on models are bound to change according to current societal	73.68000030517578	250.38360595703125	12.00042724609375	433.42284393310547	175
circumstances. Parents and their children in western Germany assume that the pure	73.68000030517578	277.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	398.4568099975586	175
housewife model has become impractical and employment of the mother necessary and thus	73.68000030517578	305.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	442.52513885498047	175
cause a modernization of the male breadwinner model in practice. However, the traditional	73.68000030517578	333.1835632324219	12.00042724609375	436.47579193115234	175
attitude, that mothers above all have to take care of their children, persists. Either way an	73.68000030517578	360.7835693359375	12.00042724609375	427.00875091552734	175
occupation is secondary. This opposes the implementation of the two-income model and an	73.68000030517578	388.383544921875	12.00042724609375	438.8506393432617	175
egalitarian labor division in partnerships. The availability and (alleged) dependency	73.68000030517578	415.98358154296875	12.00042724609375	401.9957504272461	175
concerning grandparental material and practical support also provokes the western German	73.68000030517578	443.58355712890625	12.00042724609375	437.1017074584961	175
interviewees to be emotionally dependent on them and their judgments thus limiting	73.68000030517578	471.1835632324219	12.00042724609375	404.46480560302734	175
opportunities to modernize.	73.68000030517578	498.903564453125	12.00042724609375	132.4572525024414	175
The passing on from one generation to the next is beneficial for the eastern German	73.68000030517578	536.4635620117188	12.00042724609375	401.0659408569336	176
interviewees. This enables finding a flexible arrangement of chores and employment in a	73.68000030517578	564.0635986328125	12.00042724609375	426.79048919677734	176
partnership, eases compatibility of family and professional life and lowers labor market	73.68000030517578	591.54345703125	12.000457763671875	419.7337875366211	176
risks. This discourages desisting from the ideal two-income model (employment of mothers	73.68000030517578	619.1435546875	12.000457763671875	440.73009490966797	176
is still valued positively), but also accepts the male breadwinner model if necessary. What	73.68000030517578	646.7435302734375	12.000457763671875	432.15218353271484	176
seems to be an adjustment to western German conditions may also be interpreted as “typical	73.68000030517578	674.343505859375	12.000457763671875	442.3870162963867	176
