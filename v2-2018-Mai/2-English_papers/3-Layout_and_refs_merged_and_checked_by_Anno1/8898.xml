Abstract: Elite physicians have been portrayed as opposed to the use of laboratory science in the	144.6999969482422	194.99249267578125	9.247314453125	392.10108947753906	5
hospital. In this paper John Harley WARNER's research regarding use of the terms "natural" and	144.6999969482422	209.092529296875	9.0	386.6050567626953	5
"normal" in case notes in the U.S., as representative of the growing influence of laboratory science	144.6999969482422	223.29248046875	9.0	393.7040557861328	5
in the hospital, is compared to use of these words at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and Adden-	144.6999969482422	237.39251708984375	9.0	397.0970001220703	5
brooke's Hospital, Cambridge, England. Discourse at Bart's appears to support the view of elite	144.6999969482422	251.592529296875	9.0	378.7801055908203	5
opposition to the laboratory. However, the case notes reveal that the bacteriological laboratory was	144.6999969482422	265.6925048828125	9.0	395.49513244628906	5
used at least as often as at Addenbrooke's. This apparent contradiction is investigated by examin-	144.6999969482422	279.89251708984375	9.0	391.9970245361328	5
ing how the words "natural" and "normal" were used, and the reception of experimental physiology	144.6999969482422	293.99249267578125	9.0	392.6079864501953	5
at the hospitals. Samuel GEE, a physician at Bart's in the late nineteenth century, who also, at first	144.6999969482422	308.1925048828125	9.0	393.27406311035156	5
glance, had contradictory views on the use of the laboratory in the hospital, is examined through his	144.6999969482422	322.29248046875	8.999969482421875	389.2996368408203	5
practice and writings in order to understand that representations of reception of laboratory science	144.6999969482422	336.4924621582031	9.0	391.0039825439453	5
are not straightforward. Analysing changes in language over time shows that rhetoric and practice	144.6999969482422	350.59246826171875	9.0	391.00416564941406	5
are not always aligned, and that language cannot always be seen as an indicator of the latter.	144.6999969482422	364.79248046875	9.0	373.9821319580078	5

Elite London physicians have presented themselves as both opposed to laboratory	144.6999969482422	683.479736328125	11.0	386.9997100830078	21

of the rise of laboratory biomedical sciences. Current historiography has	144.6999969482422	711.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	351.23204040527344	21

them as considering medicine an art rather than a science. This case has	144.6999969482422	740.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	358.07899475097656	21

London1. An analysis of discourse in the case notes from Bart's between 1880	144.6999969482422	107.55914306640625	11.62054443359375	380.76405334472656	24
and 1920 appears to confirm the idea that physicians were reluctant to fully	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	366.39402770996094	24
support the changes in ideology that experimental laboratory science brought to	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	389.0100860595703	24
medicine. This is especially highlighted when Bart's is compared to	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	325.86305236816406	24
Addenbrooke's Hospital, at the time the unofficial teaching hospital for the	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	359.8260040283203	24
University of Cambridge, and to hospitals in the United States of America.	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	359.62001037597656	24
However, the idea that elite physicians were not opposed to the laboratory has	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	382.43202209472656	24
recently been raised regarding the practice of elite physicians who used	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	349.5950469970703	24
commercial bacteriological laboratories, as only elite practitioners with wealthy	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	380.9999542236328	24
patients could have afforded the prices charged by these institutions	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	332.8209991455078	24
(WORBOYS, 2004). Looking at medical practice at Bart's confirms this view, and	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	394.4949493408203	24
shows that the elite physicians who worked there welcomed the new science of	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	385.86305236816406	24

The understanding of discourse in this paper is informed by work on the U.S..	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	377.7560577392578	25
One of the major findings in John Harley WARNER's (1997a) pioneering study of	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	394.9099884033203	25
patient records is the change of language from "natural" to "normal" over time. He	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	399.15809631347656	25
shows, with examples of two U.S. hospitals, that the use of the word "natural" to	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	389.6100616455078	25
describe a state of well-being had been "almost completely replaced" by "normal"	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	395.9040069580078	25
by the mid-1870s. "Natural" related to an individual's well-being, which could differ	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	399.16297912597656	25
with the seasons, or with ethnicity, location or sex, for example (WARNER,	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	364.4889678955078	25
1997a, pp.85-86). The term "natural" refers to disease as non-specific, and as	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	380.56300354003906	25
"systemic imbalances in the body's natural harmony" (WARNER, 1997a, p.86)2.	144.6999969482422	418.8591003417969	11.620574951171875	388.04701232910156	25
"Normal" is a word from experimental physiology which belongs to the second	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	379.3111114501953	25
half of the nineteenth century, when "universalized norms defined by laboratory	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	385.99501037597656	25
science" became the way to consider well-being (WARNER, 1997a, pp.86-87).	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	383.74195861816406	25
This is reflected in the graphical and quantitative representation of temperature,	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	388.36305236816406	25

appropriation of laboratory science, and how much they believed in the worth of its	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	388.69984436035156	30

There will be slightly more focus on Bart's in this paper, as this is the hospital	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	375.3209991455078	31

from the use of the word "natural" to the word "normal". In order to examine the	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	386.57911682128906	31
differences between the hospitals I shall first examine how Bart's and	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	337.1949920654297	31
Addenbrooke's have been represented by historians. The creation of case notes	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	391.24195861816406	31

will be considered in light of the use of laboratory sciences at the two English	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	374.9580841064453	31
hospitals, and the "double lives" which Bart's physicians appeared to lead,	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	360.98402404785156	31

Although being linked by the theme "Time and Discourse" to the other papers in	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	389.4580841064453	32
this volume, this contribution is different in that it looks at change in discourse	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	377.8209991455078	32
over a long time period of forty years. Also, it looks at the late nineteenth and	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	375.4950714111328	32
early twentieth centuries whereas the other papers examine contemporary events	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	397.67897033691406	32
or the very recent past. However, MOREIRA and especially MOTZKAU, ground	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	387.01600646972656	32
their work historically. The paper also differs from almost all of the others by	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	370.3159942626953	32
examining the use of particular words to examine changing concepts, rather than	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	394.7420196533203	32
a wider framework of discourse. The use of these words is, however, analysed to	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	395.2100372314453	32
examine the more general change in ideology regarding the use of laboratory	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	377.04200744628906	32
science in medicine. There are similarities to ELGAARD JENSEN's paper, which	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	392.5630645751953	32
looks at a single word in examining the construction of the "future" in discourse in	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	396.20509338378906	32
a study of representation of a new kind of office space, analysing how this word is	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	398.6890411376953	32
used to persuade "witnesses" and how it is then replicated. The identity of the	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	378.4261016845703	32
company is constructed through this word, and in this paper on the history of	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	373.26295471191406	32
medicine, words are also seen to illustrate a changing identity of physicians over	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	391.8419952392578	32

Historian of medicine, Christopher LAWRENCE, focuses on the physicians at this	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	397.4049835205078	38
hospital, especially in his article on the interwar years (LAWRENCE, 1998), giving	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	398.61598205566406	38

examined how London hospital physicians differed from those in the rest of the	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	384.32606506347656	39
country, except perhaps Oxford. Roy PORTER (2001, p.255) describes London's	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	385.39991760253906	39
elite physicians of the nineteenth century as having "plush positions of professional	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	396.53199768066406	39

themes in his articles on the London medical profession and their clinical practice	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	395.54701232910156	39
from 1850-1939, is the idea of gentility amongst the elite. He attributes this	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	363.9521026611328	39
mentality to the "distinguished lay governors" who selected physicians by "class	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	387.79908752441406	39

Gerald GEISON (1978, pp.9, 81 and 96) considers that Cambridge was a	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	357.9630584716797	52

a physician to Addenbrooke's (ROOK et al., 1991, p.58). So there must only have been a small	158.8000030517578	740.3924560546875	9.0	379.4971160888672	54

was agreed that the University would pay the hospital £300 per year, and the	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	374.37403869628906	58
Regius Professor could be a Physician, with the Professor choosing whether he	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	388.37904357910156	58

purposes. ALLBUTT declined the offer of beds to supervise, telling the Hospital	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	386.4679718017578	58
he already had enough for teaching purposes (ROOK et al., 1991, p.248). He did	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	395.1210479736328	58

Addenbrooke's' X-rays were initially carried out at the Cavendish Laboratory, by	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	387.9629669189453	58

1896. Indeed, Mr. HAYLES was, according to some Cambridge medical	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	350.1420135498047	58

1991, p.332). Addenbrooke's got its own machine in 1903, firstly with surgeons	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	384.56398010253906	58

interesting considering the view discussed earlier of Bart's and technological	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	372.00001525878906	58

closely connected in geographical terms. In the late nineteenth century,	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	348.0049591064453	58

to medicine (GEISON, 1978, p.108)6. In 1883-4, the scientists at the University	144.6999969482422	135.859130859375	11.62054443359375	383.09400939941406	65

University. A university-wide decision was made to give more power in decision-	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	389.6630401611328	65
making to residents of the University, as opposed to non-residents. This meant	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	384.5049591064453	65

physiological pathologist, rather than a clinical pathologist (WEATHERALL, 2000,	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	396.55799865722656	65

would "blight the hopes of those who were looking forward to the establishment of	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	398.61000061035156	65

From the clinical records at Bart's it is clear that the internal medicine case notes	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	393.14198303222656	67
were not actually completed by the physicians examined in this paper, but by	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	374.2420196533203	67
clinical clerks. Their names always begin with "Mr." rather than "Dr." in the	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	361.03099060058594	67
internal medicine case notes. However, there are indicators that the physicians	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	384.33204650878906	67
had a heavy influence on the case notes. Geoffrey BOURNE (1963, pp.35 and	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	383.0950469970703	67

mentioned in the case notes were medical students in the clinical years of their	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	383.9309844970703	67
degree. Clerking involved taking histories and physical examinations. Physicians	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	392.0160675048828	67
were involved in this process though. BOURNE describes how John DRYSDALE	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	393.59303283691406	67
led students to describe the condition of the patient through his "Socratic method	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	393.92103576660156	67
of careful questioning", and then led them through "examination, inspection,	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	369.85804748535156	67
palpation, percussion and auscultation." These notes were read out to the	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	359.7889862060547	67

In a couple of instances in the casebooks, physicians' involvement is illustrated.	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	387.7940216064453	68
For example, physicians signed requests for the pathologist to undertake a	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	364.96299743652344	68

The symbol was used frequently in 1893 (in five out of ten cases) and in 1897 (in	144.6999969482422	197.0797119140625	11.0	394.3209991455078	76

(SBH 16/39 and 16/43). This again shows the influence of physicians on their	144.6999969482422	239.47967529296875	11.0	376.7631378173828	76

that Samuel GEE wrote part or all of 69 out of 90 sets of case notes between	144.6999969482422	267.7796630859375	11.0	375.7160186767578	76

example, and a sheet detailing diet and treatments prescribed. Later, extra pages	144.6999969482422	380.97967529296875	11.0	397.29994201660156	77
such as pathology and X-ray reports were included. These are not in specific	144.6999969482422	395.1796875	11.0	374.3629913330078	77

WARNER shows the transition from "natural" to "normal" with his study of the	144.6999969482422	593.2797241210938	11.0	377.1260528564453	79

compared to the 405 cases examined at Bart's and 1418 at Addenbrooke's is	144.6999969482422	635.6796875	11.0	376.3889923095703	79
more significant for trends. However, there are noticeable differences which can	144.6999969482422	649.8796997070312	11.0	389.97901916503906	79

The change is significant with hardly any records using "natural" by the 1870s	144.6999969482422	369.6796875	11.0	378.5110626220703	85

right up until 1920, with "normal" not even becoming predominant by the last	144.6999969482422	747.2797241210938	11.000007629394531	372.3520050048828	87

"normal" throughout most of the period. WARNER considers that the use of	144.6999969482422	470.2796936035156	11.0	368.51002502441406	92

Although the sample is small compared to WARNER's, the word natural was	144.6999969482422	498.5796813964844	11.0	363.30503845214844	92
evidently very much in use at Bart's throughout the period 1880-1920, indicating	144.6999969482422	512.6796875	11.0	389.69996643066406	92
that medical practice would, like language, not be affected as much as other	144.6999969482422	526.8796997070312	11.0	371.8050079345703	92

WARNER (1997a, pp.5-6, 85-7) framed the change from "natural" to "normal" as	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	393.8629913330078	119
coinciding with the gradual growth of experimental physiology as a model science	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	397.23707580566406	119
for medicine. The use of therapeutics changed from acting on the body as a	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	370.36305236816406	119
whole to restore the patient's individual "natural" balance, to working on specific	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	387.84205627441406	119
parts of the body in line with knowledge gained from experimental physiology,	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	378.14698791503906	119
with the aim of returning the body to universalised "measured, quantified norms"	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	390.8990020751953	119
determined or influenced by the laboratory. The influence of experimental	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	357.80494689941406	119
physiology may point to why changes in language were so different at	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	339.80992126464844	119

Mid to late nineteenth century German experimental physiology is associated with	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	398.19410705566406	120
"biophysics" and the use of instruments (and also chemistry), sometimes	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	354.69996643066406	120
resulting in graphical representation such as the recording of the pulse by the	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	377.1260528564453	120
kymograph and sphygmograph (CRANEFIELD, 1957, p.407; FRANK, 1988,	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	370.61097717285156	120

nineteenth century, the University of Cambridge was arguably the "leading center	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	395.85804748535156	120
of physiological research in England, if not the world" (GEISON, 1978, pp.183-4).	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	395.72608947753906	120
The style of experimental physiology was not perhaps as exacting as in Germany,	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	399.1470489501953	120
with less emphasis on graphical representation, and more on the senses. In	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	369.4099884033203	120

1870 the Royal College of Surgeons introduced a requirement that thirty classes	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	391.77406311035156	124

with students themselves partaking in experiments, and the University of London	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	393.14295959472656	124
adopted this requirement in 1871 (GEISON, 1978, pp.329). GEISON considers	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	385.0160675048828	124
this development led to the growth of physiology in Britain (GEISON, 1978,	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	364.9580841064453	124
pp.150-1). The discipline of physiology in Britain as a whole expanded between	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	385.91603088378906	124
1870 and 1900, at least arresting the flow of physiologists to the Continent	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	362.2839813232422	124

Keir WADDINGTON (2003, pp.125-6) has presented physiology at Bart's as	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	370.91603088378906	125
being taught reluctantly10. However, many of the initial problems which physiology	144.6999969482422	404.6590881347656	11.62060546875	397.2160186767578	125
faced were also present in Cambridge, such as lack of space for students	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	349.59983825683594	125
(GEISON, 1978, pp.171-2). Although Bart's did not have the reputation of the	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	367.42604064941406	125
Cambridge school of physiology, Thomas Lauder BRUNTON was very	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	343.97901916503906	125
enthusiastic about experimental pharmacology and physiology, publishing widely,	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	396.04701232910156	125
and working on treatments which had practical applications such as the action of	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	392.61000061035156	125
digitalis. Like contemporaries at Cambridge, he spent time at the University	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	366.56797790527344	125
College London laboratories, and in laboratories in Vienna, Berlin and at	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	351.81004333496094	125
LUDWIG's laboratory in Leipzig in the early 1870s. However, rather than	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	353.1420135498047	125
specialising in experimental physiology like GASKELL, he combined research	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	377.91102600097656	125
with hospital medicine (WHITE FRANKLIN, 1974, pp.180-83; LAWRENCE, 1985,	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	397.3579864501953	125
pp.516-17). Therefore, the impact of physiology at Bart's is not straightforward	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	381.4950714111328	125
and requires further investigation, but no doubt did not have the same influence	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	387.56410217285156	125

Bacteriology, and its forerunners from the 1840s (ideas of "specific chemical,	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	375.1890411376953	126

10 WADDINGTON (2003, p.131) also presents bacteriology as being negatively received at Bart's	144.6999969482422	756.5924682617188	9.0	393.19105529785156	128
in the 1880s and presents a picture of Samuel GEE being opposed to the use of the laboratory, so	158.8000030517578	766.5924682617188	9.0	383.90379333496094	128

diphtheria. There was a slow acceptance of the bacteriological examination for	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	382.76307678222656	131

Bart's physician may help to illuminate why discourse was so different from	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	365.0789337158203	131

The concept of "double lives" can be used as a device to try to understand why	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	385.45802307128906	133
physicians' images were presented differently at different times, and why practice	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	396.14698791503906	133
was different to language at Bart's. Samuel GEE is an ideal character to use as a	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	396.16297912597656	133

his own writings used within this, shows him to be apparently leading a	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	344.1630096435547	133
completely different life to that shown by his medical practice on the wards at	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	375.0630645751953	133

Samuel GEE began his professional career at Bart's in 1870, becoming a full	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	374.8570098876953	134

GEE has been portrayed as an advocate of medicine as an art. Indeed,	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	348.0210418701172	135

(WADDINGTON, 2003, p.117). GEE's patients were diagnosed with Widal's tests	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	396.55702209472656	142

also be seen that GEE (MS36, pp.135-6, 305 and 306) used the bacteriological	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	385.9580841064453	143

and again concerning phthisis, that amongst all the methods of diagnosis, the	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	377.92604064941406	144
most important was, "above all, detection of tubercle bacilli in the sputa". He even	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	397.5320587158203	144

typhoid accompanied by delirium, he considered that "testing the blood by	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	360.2629852294922	144

He wrote a very similar comment privately, showing his conviction about the worth	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	399.38404846191406	149

the same manner as it could be used for inflammation (GEE, 1915b, p.95). These	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	398.44801330566406	149

GEE's advocacy of opposing ideas was part of his personality. LEGG (1915,	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	372.02101135253906	150

difficult to unravel." GEE (1915c, pp.216 and 229; MS35, p.241) wrote publicly	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	381.3000030517578	150
and privately about his dislike of dogmatism. In spite of these attacks on	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	351.73204040527344	150
dogmatism, GEE (1915c, p.236) had a "kindly feeling" towards the "Empiric sect",	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	397.80397033691406	150
which was, apparently, although in his category of dogmatic sects, "much less	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	380.20497131347656	150
dogmatic" than his other examples. GEE is not the glowing example of an	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	359.53196716308594	150
advocate of empiricism which he has been portrayed as though, as he states that	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	396.4729766845703	150
"the empiric … is the ant which gathers facts but does not transmute them … his	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	393.20497131347656	150
harvests are scanty. Well for him that all physicians are not empirics" (GEE,	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	369.4560089111328	150
1915c, pp.239-40)14. Indeed, LEGG (1915, p.363) considered GEE a sceptic15.	144.6999969482422	418.8591003417969	11.620574951171875	382.4469757080078	150
GEE's lack of conviction about anything is demonstrated by LEGG's recollection	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	390.31605529785156	150

"opinions on one subject, books or men, rarely last the same for any time. One would	167.39999389648438	476.8360900878906	10.0	374.1600036621094	151
have talk with him, and a fortnight after resume the conversation at the point where it	167.39999389648438	490.93609619140625	10.0	372.1700744628906	151
was left off and then it would be found that the whole tone of his thought had	167.39999389648438	505.1361083984375	10.0	335.3200988769531	151

Indeed, his aphoristic style of writing, privately, and publicly in HORDER's	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	358.49000549316406	152
collection of his aphorisms, is perfect for GEE's undogmatic and eclectic way of	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	387.2100372314453	152
thinking. GEE wrote privately, "[t]he advantage of the aphoristic way of writing is	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	390.0890655517578	152

disarranging the structure" (GEE, MS34, p.124). GEE (MS34, pp.126 and 140-	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	383.35804748535156	152

This doubt in GEE's thinking helps to explain why he may have been slightly	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	370.9889678955078	153
reticent about the new experimental sciences infiltrating clinical medicine. He	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	374.60499572753906	153
appears to have considered many innovations and new ideas, not accepting any	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	391.57899475097656	153
belief in particular. He did not wholly accept empiricism or experimental science.	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	390.2840118408203	153
LEGG's (1915, p.363) comment, "[t]hough he knew so much, yet his scepticism	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	387.6630401611328	153

Addenbrooke's and the U.S., can be explained more easily. Older physicians had	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	395.6950225830078	173

GEE shows that medical practice was perhaps torn between an old and a new	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	381.3209991455078	173
