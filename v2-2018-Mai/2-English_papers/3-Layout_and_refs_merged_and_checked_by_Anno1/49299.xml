We decided to use the LG approach to complement the case-study research	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	373.5271759033203	28
methodology as it has proved useful in previous studies in engaging with	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	353.63902282714844	28
participants, supporting them to talk about their experiences and collecting	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	362.62608337402344	28

adolescent relationships are profoundly impacted by adolescent substance abuse	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	397.1332550048828	28
given the various psychosocial and economic stresses associated with	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	343.39808654785156	28
adolescent substance abuse (see for example JACKSON & MANNIX, 2003;	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	370.14991760253906	28

WEGNER, AREND, BASSADIEN, BISMATH & CROS, 2014). In light of this we	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	386.96888732910156	28

could influence the kind of information they are willing to recall. In order to	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	359.80992126464844	28
facilitate recall of these events we thought to use a data collection tool that will	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	381.48011779785156	28

In the following sections we provide an overview of the LG and the methodology	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	389.6862335205078	29
of our study. We will then discuss our findings in relation to the usefulness of the	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	392.31520080566406	29
LG. Finally we outline some of the practical challenges we faced in using the LG	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	390.5990753173828	29
and provide some ideas on how to overcome these challenges. [3]	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	323.7469940185547	29

The LG is a tool used to construct a visual chronological framework of a person's	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	394.4052276611328	31
life (RICHARDSON, ONG, SIM & CORBETT, 2009; WILSON et al., 2007). It	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	373.0209503173828	31
generally takes a chart-like structure with several rows and columns, where the	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	384.9340362548828	31
rows usually represent the person's life in years (each row is a particular year)	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	380.0060577392578	31
and the columns represent significant life events (WILSON et al., 2007). The	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	373.3400421142578	31
significant life events are selected aspects of the participants' lives that the	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	363.77012634277344	31
researcher wishes to explore. These aspects are closely related to the research	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	388.12416076660156	31
questions of the study and can include topics such as family life, friends and	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	370.8760528564453	31
social relationships, place of residence, occupation and so forth. For example, the	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	398.83827209472656	31
LG was used to explore the life course of cancer patients using selected aspects	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	392.7881622314453	31
such as "personal life events," "education, lifestyle," "residence," "occupation"	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	377.98219299316406	31
and "other" (NOVOGRADEC, 2009, p.2). A completed LG then allows the	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	358.8090362548828	31
researcher to assess how the participant's life has changed over a certain period	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	392.88722229003906	31
of time and when these changes occurred. When the LG is used to facilitate	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	370.7770538330078	31
qualitative data gathering, it further allows the researchers to unpack how the	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	376.37611389160156	31

qualitative interviews. BELL (2005, p.53) however warns that while the LG may	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	383.82313537597656	36
improve the quality of the data collected, it could also restrict "the extent to which	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	394.05311584472656	36

use the LG during the second interview, we also included questions that focused	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	392.4582061767578	40
on when certain experiences occurred and when relationships changed. For	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	369.95216369628906	40

Following the first interview with the mother, the interviewer (first author) partially	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	392.16102600097656	44
filled in the LG with some of the information that was gathered during the first	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	376.0020294189453	44
interview. The partially completed LG was then co-completed during the second	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	388.4871368408203	44
interview. In this case, the mother indicated that she would like the interviewer to	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	392.29212951660156	44
continue filling in the grid on her behalf as she did not want to do the actual	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	366.1290740966797	44
writing but was comfortable to do the activity. [9]	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	235.04701232910156	44
The second interview with the mother commenced with a recap of the LG. This	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	384.0100860595703	45
helped ensure that the mother was primed to discuss her experiences in greater	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	390.0602569580078	45
depth using the partially completed LG as a guide. The LG approach proved to be	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	399.03627014160156	45
useful during this interview both as a means to document information chronologically,	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	398.4746856689453	45
and facilitating the recall of events and experiences. It is our experience that the	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	389.73023986816406	45
LG was well received, appeared to be easily understood by the mother, and	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	368.7752227783203	45
allowed us to ask sensitive questions (described in the findings). [10]	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	335.14698791503906	45

The pilot continued with the adolescent participant. Given the favorable outcomes	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	397.2211456298828	47
of the interviews with the mother, we decided to incorporate the LG during the	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	379.1371612548828	47
first interview with the adolescent to determine how he will respond to a blank LG.	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	397.6061553955078	47
The same processes were followed as with the mother: the LG was introduced	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	382.4370880126953	47
and explained to the adolescent and was then co-completed. This approach was	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	392.0841827392578	47
found to be acceptable because, as in the case of his mother, the LG appeared	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	387.03529357910156	47
to have been understood and easy to co-complete. Practically, using the LG in	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	382.1400909423828	47
this way also allowed the interviewer to check and therefore capture the	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	349.3380889892578	47
information more accurately without having to correct it in a next interview. The	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	383.83412170410156	47

Given the various challenges associated with the accuracy of participant recall in	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	392.82118225097656	49
retrospective studies, researchers have since argued that the inclusion of	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	356.9831085205078	49

reliability) in subject self-report (AMODEO & GRIFFIN, 2009). We therefore	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	367.33399963378906	49
interviewed five parent-adolescent pairs, each consisting of one mother and her	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	388.33326721191406	49

children was used. The adolescents' LG comprised eleven columns by roughly 30	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	397.95826721191406	54
rows, depending on the age of the participant. The mothers' LG was eleven	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	367.4110870361328	54

space should there be more than one significant event per year to document. In	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	388.09120178222656	54
using the LG we were interested in when significant events occurred and how the	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	396.0001983642578	54

up questions such as "tell me about how you felt when your child told you that he	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	393.7891387939453	54

The participants generally requested that the interviewer complete the LG.	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	361.9550323486328	55

Given that a blank lifegrid could prove to be daunting to participants with complex	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	396.1651153564453	56

our meetings. The interviewer explained that the LG will be used during the	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	366.0030059814453	56

that there is no right or wrong answers and that the information that will be written	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	397.56214904785156	56
is fully dependent on what will be discussed during the interview. Lastly, it was	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	380.5340118408203	56

We found the LG useful to establish interviewer-participant rapport and "breaking	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	395.2742462158203	63

complete a jigsaw puzzle." WILSON et al. (2007) add that the practical	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	344.2230987548828	63
completion of the LG averts the need for continuous eye contact which can	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	365.15611267089844	63

particularly important for sensitive research such as the current study as it allows	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	393.5581817626953	92
the participants the space to pause or return to certain issues when they are	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	371.1951446533203	92
ready to discuss those (WILSON et al., 2007). This was also a key finding in	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	371.84400939941406	92

Furthermore, while some researchers might argue that the information collected	144.6999969482422	296.5797119140625	11.0	389.21315002441406	121
in LG interviews can be elicited in conventional questioning, we found the LG	144.6999969482422	310.6796875	11.0	374.96803283691406	121
useful in encouraging the participants to tell their stories in a less confronting and	144.6999969482422	324.87969970703125	11.0	395.54920959472656	121
more innovative way (SHERIDAN et al., 2011; WILSON et al., 2007). WILSON et	144.6999969482422	338.97967529296875	11.0	395.5600128173828	121
al. (2007) point out that conventional interviewing have the potential to be boring	144.6999969482422	353.1796875	11.0	390.96217346191406	121
and repetitive. The LG, they argue, was useful in their work to discuss sensitive	144.6999969482422	367.2796936035156	11.0	386.46315002441406	121
issues without confronting participants with a long list of personal questions	144.6999969482422	381.47967529296875	11.0	366.79505920410156	121
(ibid.). SHERIDAN et al. (2011) further add that timeline interviews can represent	144.6999969482422	395.5796813964844	11.0	394.1631622314453	121
an "aide-memoire, focusing attention beyond what is possible through talk alone,	144.6999969482422	409.7796936035156	11.0	393.48121643066406	121
thus becoming not only a piece of data in its own right but a vehicle through	144.6999969482422	423.87969970703125	11.0	368.1370391845703	121
which further data were produced" (p.554). In this regard, it is our experience that	144.6999969482422	438.0796813964844	11.0	396.7482452392578	121
the LG itself represented the lives of the participants during the interviews in such	144.6999969482422	452.1796875	11.0	396.9571075439453	121
a way that it became the object of discussion rather than the parents'	144.6999969482422	466.37969970703125	11.0	336.1161651611328	121
experiences. This physical focus on the LG might have encouraged the	144.6999969482422	480.47967529296875	11.0	347.2811737060547	121

reflecting on their lives, emotions and experiences through the LG. [24]	144.6999969482422	508.7796630859375	11.0	346.44700622558594	121

The LG is usually completed by one participant at a time (see for example	144.6999969482422	565.3796997070312	11.0	360.00807189941406	123

the LG with couples who completed it together (BELL, 2005). We used the LG	144.6999969482422	607.8796997070312	11.0	380.9301300048828	123

abuse treatment centers, etc.) the interviewer was able to pick this up and	144.6999969482422	678.5797119140625	11.0	360.1730499267578	123
discuss it with the other. This was at times a challenging activity as it required the	144.6999969482422	692.7797241210938	11.0	396.1870880126953	123

recalled information is less important than meaning and experience. In our study	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	391.4572296142578	181
we were not only interested in when life events occurred, but also the subjective	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	388.98207092285156	181
experiences and meanings of these life events, and how these events influenced	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	393.7012481689453	181
and changed the lives of the participants. Given our focus on experiences (and	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	384.14222717285156	181
with concerns pertaining to recall in the back of our minds) we decided to	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	355.8610076904297	181
interview the mothers and adolescents while the adolescent was completing	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	369.6660919189453	181
his/her treatment at the rehabilitation centers. It is our experience that this	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	359.7330780029297	181
facilitated recall as the participants were reflecting on current and fairly recent	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	377.93812561035156	181
experiences. [29]	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	83.94700622558594	181
Furthermore researching sensitive issues, like those discussed in our study, is a	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	390.09303283691406	182
challenging task which required us to identify methodologies that are	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	334.5210723876953	182
appropriately sensitive while at the same time facilitative. Using the literature as	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	387.25502014160156	182
our guide (see for example BUTLER & BAULD, 2005; USHER et al., 2007), we	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	385.0219268798828	182
understood that talking about the adolescent's substance abuse would be a	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	367.89515686035156	182
difficult task for both the mothers and the adolescents (especially to a "stranger").	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	396.9462432861328	182
In this regard, we were cognizant of the possibility of selective recall where	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	363.89100646972656	182
participants are unable (or perhaps unwilling) to recall certain events, or show	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	378.21302795410156	182
selective recall bias in favor of what is "easier" to discuss. Studies show that	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	370.66712951660156	182
individuals have the tendency to forget information that they perceive self-	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	359.98609924316406	182
threatening (for full discussions on these issues, please refer to GREEN,	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	354.3319854736328	182
SEDIKIDES & GREGG, 2007; SAUNDERS, 2012). We therefore recognized that	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	394.83412170410156	182
participant recall, which was essential to obtain data that is information rich in our	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	395.3952178955078	182
study, was intrinsically dependent on our participants' abilities and willingness to	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	389.54310607910156	182
tell their stories. As put forth by BROWN and REAVY (2014) recall operates as a	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	393.7450714111328	182
shared activity and in our study the LG acted as a quasi-neutral stimulus to the	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	383.4712677001953	182
participants memories that accommodated the complexities of recall and	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	353.3970489501953	182

Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing Adolescents	144.6999969482422	61.24884033203125	8.0	331.12794494628906	184
facilitated discussions in a non-threatening and sensitive way and extended the	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	386.0012969970703	185
study beyond the traditional 1:1 interview. [30]	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	224.14698791503906	185
Some of the practical challenges (and solutions) we encountered with the LG are	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	394.3941192626953	186
also important to note here. Initially, the interviewer used a semi-structured	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	364.17701721191406	186
interview guide that posed questions chronologically which, as discussed earlier,	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	391.79811096191406	186
did not appropriately lend itself to the conversational and the non-linear way in	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	380.42408752441406	186
which the participants recalled their experiences. It is our experience that a	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	364.71607971191406	186
formative phase helps allay anxieties about the tool, but also serves to prime the	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	391.80921936035156	186
participant in identifying key questions and life events categories, such as	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	358.3910675048828	186
relationships, school, work etc. that will be discussed in the LG interview. It might	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	394.1081085205078	186
also be useful to identify possible life-events from the literature and incorporate	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	384.74708557128906	186
these in the LG interview. In some instances the participants thought that the LG	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	392.3042755126953	186
was a way for the interviewer to document aspects of the participants' lives rather	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	396.3192901611328	186
than an activity to be co-completed by the participants and the interviewer. Once	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	391.6001739501953	186
this was brought to the attention of the interviewer, she was able to explain in as	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	390.56617736816406	186
much detail as needed that the LG is way to facilitate discussions. It is therefore	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	389.07008361816406	186
useful for researchers to introduce the LG in such a way that the participants are	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	392.4472198486328	186
not distracted by the notion of providing the "right answer" but are comfortable to	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	393.0192413330078	186
discuss their experiences. [31]	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	148.3470001220703	186
When using the LG with participant pairs (collateral informants) it is important for	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	392.7111358642578	187
researchers to be careful not to "take sides" when cross-referencing and	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	353.1660614013672	187
comparing events. In our study we respected that the participants' accounts	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	368.39015197753906	187
reflected their subjective experiences and perspectives. We certainly recognized	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	392.0402374267578	187
the significance of the participants' silences and selective recall as it tells us	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	369.0060577392578	187
something about the significance of particular experiences. In cross-referencing	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	388.09120178222656	187
or comparing events between the participant pairs we were less interested in	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	373.7580108642578	187
whose accounts were "right" or "wrong." Rather we found the LG useful in that it	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	390.25819396972656	187
allowed us to use relevant information obtained from one participant (f.e., the	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	375.1221466064453	187
adolescent) to probe for more detail from the other participant (f.e., the parent).	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	385.6161651611328	187
This afforded us an opportunity to gain a more informed understanding of the	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	376.3540802001953	187
participants' experiences and perspectives. [32]	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	231.94700622558594	187
A further challenge relates to simultaneously conducting and analyzing the LG	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	380.7870635986328	188
interviews. Given the fluidity of the participants' conversations, it is important for	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	387.7721710205078	188
the interviewer to continually verbally note the dates (in days, months or years)	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	383.2511749267578	188
that they are referring to when discussing the life events during the interview. In	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	387.2110137939453	188
our study for example, the interviewer sometimes neglected to record time and	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	383.4491729736328	188
date sequences which may conflate events in the coding of the transcripts. This is	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	399.0801544189453	188
especially imperative for researchers who are interested in tracking changes in	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	383.37208557128906	188
life-events and experiences. [33]	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	158.7469940185547	188

This article describes the utility of the LG in qualitative inquiries. We found the LG	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	397.6501007080078	192
approach useful in helping explore the breadth and depth of events as we were	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	385.53919982910156	192
not only interested in when significant events occurred but also the participants'	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	386.47413635253906	193
experiences of, and changes in, these selected areas of their lives. While the LG	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	393.22816467285156	193
worked well in our study, it is advisable that researchers conduct a formative	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	372.0420684814453	194

their research questions are appropriately addressed. The LG as a tool and	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	367.6421661376953	195
