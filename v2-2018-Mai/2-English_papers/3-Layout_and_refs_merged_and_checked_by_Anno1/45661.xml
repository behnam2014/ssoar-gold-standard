1. Introduction	90.02400207519531	404.5841369628906	11.040008544921875	71.0494384765625	4
Can a person expect to get a car driving license just by attending the theoretical classes? Let us	90.02400207519531	423.30413818359375	11.040008544921875	433.54673767089844	4
hypothetically assume the person manages to get a license, but will he be able to drive the car? No.	90.02400207519531	442.2641296386719	11.040008544921875	436.3940887451172	4
To be a perfect car driver a person has to and does take real life driving classes. He develops new	90.02400207519531	461.22412109375	11.040008544921875	433.2318572998047	4
skills by actually driving along with the trainer.	90.02400207519531	480.18414306640625	11.040008544921875	209.02378845214844	4
Higher education aims at an optimal blend of knowledge and skills. It provides a license to the	90.02400207519531	509.5841369628906	11.040008544921875	433.5381317138672	5
student for driving successfully through the maze of what, when, why, who and how. Usually the	90.02400207519531	528.5440673828125	11.040008544921875	433.6310272216797	5
next step after higher education is a professional career. This is why role and importance of active	90.02400207519531	547.504150390625	11.040008544921875	433.37620544433594	5
learning, and not passive learning (in which an instructor depends solely or predominantly on	90.02400207519531	566.494140625	11.040008544921875	433.1103973388672	5
passive lectures), is crucial throughout higher education.	90.02400207519531	585.4541015625	11.040008544921875	248.7523651123047	5
2. Active learning	90.02400207519531	614.9741821289062	11.039993286132812	82.89936828613281	6
Roots of active learning can be traced to Confucius (551-479 BC), who stated, “I hear and I	90.02400207519531	633.6941528320312	11.039993286132812	433.5309295654297	6
forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand”. Socrates (470-399 BC) had similar views	90.02400207519531	652.774169921875	11.039993286132812	433.6350555419922	6
when he said that "I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think".	90.02400207519531	671.7341918945312	11.039993286132812	360.0760040283203	6
Dale (1969) established following relationships between level of involvement of learner and how	90.02400207519531	701.01416015625	11.039993286132812	433.3568572998047	7
much the learner remembers:- “We remember: 10% of what we read, 20% of what we hear, 30%	90.02400207519531	719.994140625	11.040000915527344	433.8226776123047	7
of what we see, 50% of what we hear and see, 70% of what we say 90% of what we do”.	90.02400207519531	738.9541625976562	11.040000915527344	389.2360076904297	7
Studies show that classroom attention-span of students varies from 15 to 25 minutes (Bligh, 1972	90.02400207519531	73.0941162109375	11.0400390625	433.6345672607422	8
as cited by Cashin, 1985). Meyers & Jones (1993) found that students’ classroom attention is poor	90.02400207519531	92.05413818359375	11.0400390625	433.55198669433594	8
for 40% of the time and they retain 70% of the information during the first ten minutes and only	90.02400207519531	111.01409912109375	11.0400390625	433.5719451904297	8
20% of the information during the last ten minutes of a lecture. In a 1997 national survey in USA,	90.02400207519531	129.97412109375	11.0400390625	433.53599548339844	8
of more than 250,000 freshmen at nearly 500 universities, 35.6% of the students said that they	90.02400207519531	148.93414306640625	11.0400390625	433.4922332763672	8
were frequently bored in class. (Berk, 2003)	90.02400207519531	168.01409912109375	11.0400390625	194.3722686767578	8
All these facts stress on the need of active learning environment in particular when, feedback	90.02400207519531	197.29412841796875	11.0400390625	433.72630310058594	9
from students has shown that passive lecture in higher education is not a preferred method of	90.02400207519531	216.254150390625	11.0400390625	433.15452575683594	9
learning. (Sander et al., 2000 as cited by Huxman, 2005)	90.02400207519531	235.244140625	11.0400390625	249.12232971191406	9
2.1 Active Learning: Defined	90.02400207519531	264.76409912109375	11.0400390625	135.6886444091797	10
Literature review highlighted the following characteristics of active learning.	90.02400207519531	283.6041259765625	11.0400390625	338.67430114746094	10
- Learning is enhanced by involving the student in activities and relationships, inside and	90.02400207519531	302.56414794921875	11.0400390625	433.2875213623047	10
outside the classroom. (Astin, 1984)	108.0199966430664	321.524169921875	11.03997802734375	159.48384857177734	10
- “Lectures are not well suited to higher levels of learning: application, analysis, synthesis,	90.02400207519531	340.484130859375	11.040008544921875	433.23924255371094	10
influencing attitudes or values. Lecturing is best suited to the lower levels of knowledge and	108.0199966430664	359.4441223144531	11.040008544921875	415.2477035522461	10
understanding.” (Cashin, 1985)	108.0199966430664	378.40411376953125	11.040008544921875	140.60469818115234	10
- “Learning is not a spectator sport. Students do not learn much just by sitting in classes	90.02400207519531	397.3841247558594	11.040008544921875	433.4379119873047	10
listening to teachers, memorizing pre-packaged assignments, and spitting out answers. They	108.0199966430664	416.3441162109375	11.040008544921875	415.41609954833984	10
must talk about what they are learning, write about it, relate it to past experiences and apply	108.0199966430664	435.30413818359375	11.040008544921875	415.23641204833984	10
it to their daily lives.” (Chickering & Gamson, 1987)	108.0199966430664	454.3841247558594	11.040008544921875	234.66265106201172	10
- Higher-order thinking through analysis, synthesis and evaluation is more important than	90.02400207519531	473.3441162109375	11.040008544921875	433.5548553466797	10
reading, writing and discussing. (Bonwell & Eison, 1991)	108.0199966430664	492.30413818359375	11.040008544921875	254.27532196044922	10
- “Active learning involves providing opportunities for students to meaningfully talk and listen,	90.02400207519531	511.2641296386719	11.040008544921875	433.5736541748047	10
write, read, and reflect on the content, ideas, issues and concerns of an academic subject.”	108.0199966430664	530.22412109375	11.040008544921875	415.31368255615234	10
(Meyers & Jones, 1993)	108.0199966430664	549.18408203125	11.040008544921875	106.35930633544922	10
- “Although humans appreciate the common and the familiar, and often resist change, the	90.02400207519531	568.174072265625	11.040008544921875	433.3208465576172	10
brain seeks and reacts to innovative occurrences.” (Angelo, 1991 as cited by Forrest, 2004)	108.0199966430664	587.1341552734375	11.039993286132812	405.2749252319336	10
- “In fact, rote learning (e.g., memorizing terminology) is frustrating because the brain resists	90.02400207519531	606.0941772460938	11.039993286132812	433.22154235839844	10
meaningless stimuli.” (Forrest, 2004)	108.0199966430664	625.1741333007812	11.039993286132812	164.82024383544922	10
Thus we may derive following definition:-	90.02400207519531	654.4541625976562	11.039993286132812	187.4223175048828	11
Active learning involves designing, implementing, maintaining and promoting, within and outside	90.02400207519531	683.7341918945312	11.039993286132812	433.37864685058594	12
classroom, environment for learning, through creating opportunities for active engagement with	90.02400207519531	702.6941528320312	11.039993286132812	433.6478729248047	12
the subject matter. It strives for higher-order thinking and in-depth comprehension of the learner.	90.02400207519531	721.7941284179688	11.040000915527344	426.8790740966797	12
2.2 Active Learning: Drawbacks	90.02400207519531	73.3341064453125	11.0400390625	152.2594451904297	13
Active involvement and interaction of the students translate into loss of teaching time as	90.02400207519531	92.05413818359375	11.0400390625	433.1654510498047	13
substantial classroom time is spent on multiple questioning and feedback sessions, (Lammers &	90.02400207519531	111.01409912109375	11.0400390625	433.3347625732422	13
Murphy, 2002 as cited by Huxman, 2005) especially while handling large classes.(Bonwell, C. &	90.02400207519531	129.97412109375	11.0400390625	433.3379364013672	13
J. Eison, 1991) It results into lesser content coverage in the classroom. (Murray & Brightman,	90.02400207519531	148.93414306640625	11.0400390625	433.53599548339844	13
1996 as cited by Huxman, 2005). But the biggest roadblock is a creation of the instructor himself	90.02400207519531	168.01409912109375	11.0400390625	433.55393981933594	13
and that is fear of failure, fear of loss of control due to enhanced classroom discussions, fear of	90.02400207519531	186.97412109375	11.0400390625	433.1654510498047	13
lack of student participation, and fear of criticism of a new method. (Bonwell, C. & J. Eison, 1991)	90.02400207519531	205.93414306640625	11.0400390625	436.9412078857422	13
2.2.1 Handling drawbacks: Short Lectures	90.02400207519531	235.484130859375	11.0400390625	199.28025817871094	14
An analysis of research papers on higher education by Chilcoat (1989) found that, continuous	90.02400207519531	254.2041015625	11.0400390625	433.5836639404297	14
rapid lecturing happens at a rate of 120 to 240 words per minute but most of the students can	90.02400207519531	273.16412353515625	11.0400390625	433.53330993652344	14
write down only 20 words per minute. Result is half cooked notes and poor understanding during	90.02400207519531	292.1241455078125	11.0400390625	433.71763610839844	14
lecture time.	90.02400207519531	311.2041015625	11.0400390625	54.9129638671875	14
A solution to the above problem can be found in a study conducted by Ruhl et al. (1987), in which	90.02400207519531	340.484130859375	11.040008544921875	433.3863983154297	15
the instructor paused for two minutes for three times during a lecture, and during these pauses	90.02400207519531	359.4441223144531	11.040008544921875	433.1654510498047	15
students worked in pairs to re-discuss the topic discussed by the instructor and then reworked on	90.02400207519531	378.40411376953125	11.040008544921875	433.2875213623047	15
their class notes to fill up the gaps left while taking down the notes during lecture. During the	90.02400207519531	397.3841247558594	11.040008544921875	433.58323669433594	15
pauses students did not engage in discussion with the instructor. At the end of the lecture three	90.02400207519531	416.3441162109375	11.040008544921875	433.5317840576172	15
minutes were given to let the students write down their free recall. Results proved that short	90.02400207519531	435.30413818359375	11.040008544921875	433.39024353027344	15
lectures of 12 to 18 minutes followed by pauses for student interaction enhance students’ learning.	90.02400207519531	454.3841247558594	11.040008544921875	432.8507537841797	15
Bonwell and Eison (1991), suggest to conduct guided lecture in which instructor lectures	90.02400207519531	483.66412353515625	11.040008544921875	433.41490173339844	16
continuously for 20 to 30 minutes without the students taking notes and then allots five minutes	90.02400207519531	502.6241149902344	11.040008544921875	433.2095184326172	16
for free recall writing by the students followed by small groups of students discussing and	90.02400207519531	521.5841064453125	11.040008544921875	433.0220184326172	16
analyzing the topic.	90.02400207519531	540.5440673828125	11.040008544921875	86.52775573730469	16
2.2.2 Handling drawbacks: Revised lecture information density	90.02400207519531	570.214111328125	11.040008544921875	296.4433135986328	17
Russell et al. (1984) conducted a research on 123 medical students and divided them into three	90.02400207519531	588.9341430664062	11.039993286132812	433.20970153808594	17
groups with no significant difference in cumulative GPA’s. First group was exposed to high	90.02400207519531	607.8941650390625	11.039993286132812	433.65599060058594	17
density lecture with 90% new content, second group was exposed to medium density lecture with	90.02400207519531	626.8541870117188	11.039993286132812	433.16551208496094	17
70% new content and third to low density lecture with 50% new content. In each lecture the	90.02400207519531	645.8141479492188	11.039993286132812	433.19859313964844	17
remaining time was spent on reinforcing the core ideas by actively involving the students and by	90.02400207519531	664.774169921875	11.039993286132812	433.5376434326172	17
relating the content to prior experience. Tests after the lectures confirmed that learning and	90.02400207519531	683.7341918945312	11.039993286132812	433.1876678466797	17
retention was higher with low density content.	90.02400207519531	702.6941528320312	11.039993286132812	203.7983856201172	17
Fedler & Brent (1996) suggest to discuss only core, critical and difficult topics in class, to give	90.02400207519531	732.1141357421875	11.040000915527344	433.40940856933594	18
brief writing assignments to the students on the self covered topics and then to test the students on	90.02400207519531	751.0741577148438	11.040000915527344	433.26487731933594	18
those topics. Wilke (2003) conducted a research on 141 students in human physiology and	90.02400207519531	73.0941162109375	11.0400390625	433.23387145996094	19
found that active learning improved students’ content achievement even when the content is	90.02400207519531	92.05413818359375	11.0400390625	433.4753875732422	19
reduced. Research had proved time and again that reduced lecture time and reduced lecture	90.02400207519531	111.01409912109375	11.0400390625	433.2958221435547	19
information density enhances learning.	90.02400207519531	129.97412109375	11.0400390625	171.02064514160156	19
2.2.3 Handling drawbacks: Expectations and responsibilities	90.02400207519531	159.6141357421875	11.0400390625	283.3502960205078	20
Lesser lecture time in the classroom and lower density content should not lead to lower	90.02400207519531	178.3341064453125	11.0400390625	433.52513122558594	20
expectations of the students or instructor. Chickering & Gamson (1987) suggest “expect more and	90.02400207519531	197.29412841796875	11.0400390625	433.5731658935547	20
you will get more”. Seeler et al. (1994) suggests that active learning environment does not mean	90.02400207519531	216.254150390625	11.0400390625	433.6029510498047	20
structure less learning environment and it does not mean undermining the importance of theory.	90.02400207519531	235.244140625	11.0400390625	433.09922790527344	20
Active learning environment not only increases the opportunities for interaction and involvement	90.02400207519531	254.2041015625	11.0400390625	433.0218963623047	20
but also responsibilities. Following are some important expectations and responsibilities as	90.02400207519531	273.16412353515625	11.0400390625	433.4930877685547	20
suggested by Seeler et al. (1994).	90.02400207519531	292.1241455078125	11.0400390625	146.5344696044922	20
Students must be more aware and be ready to be responsible for their own professional	90.02400207519531	321.524169921875	11.03997802734375	433.1765594482422	21
development. They must increase their level of involvement in the active learning environment	90.02400207519531	340.484130859375	11.040008544921875	433.22068786621094	21
and focus on application of theory to real life practice. But this does not mean that the instructor is	90.02400207519531	359.4441223144531	11.040008544921875	433.28306579589844	21
less responsible for active learning environment. Seeler et al. (1994) further suggest active	90.02400207519531	378.40411376953125	11.040008544921875	433.54148864746094	21
learning depends on the success of the instructor in helping the students successfully manage	90.02400207519531	397.3841247558594	11.040008544921875	433.3678436279297	21
transition from passive style of learning to the new one. Instructor needs to understand ability of	90.02400207519531	416.3441162109375	11.040008544921875	433.1765594482422	21
the student, develop new skills, be aware of practical applications of theory to design exercises	90.02400207519531	435.30413818359375	11.040008544921875	433.23179626464844	21
and assignments accordingly, adopt the role of facilitator and mentor. Instructor must rely on	90.02400207519531	454.3841247558594	11.040008544921875	433.3124237060547	21
feedback and make changes, if necessary.	90.02400207519531	473.3441162109375	11.040008544921875	183.50694274902344	21
Stinson & Milter (1996) also highlight instructor’s skill development and student transition as two	90.02400207519531	502.6241149902344	11.040008544921875	433.1986541748047	22
major pillars of active learning environment. They point out that the instructor needs to be an	90.02400207519531	521.5841064453125	11.040008544921875	433.2192840576172	22
active listener and a coach. So that he can encourage the students to take responsibility of their	90.02400207519531	540.5440673828125	11.040008544921875	433.1765594482422	22
own learning. This can be done effectively when the instructor gives continuous and prompt	90.02400207519531	559.5340576171875	11.040008544921875	433.58079528808594	22
feedback to the students. (Chickering & Gamson 1987)	90.02400207519531	578.6141357421875	11.040008544921875	243.22584533691406	22
2.2.4 Handling drawbacks: Student and instructor rapport	90.02400207519531	608.1341552734375	11.039993286132812	275.7402801513672	23
Confucius believed in affection and empathy towards students (Huanyin, Y., 1999). Chickering &	90.02400207519531	626.8541870117188	11.039993286132812	433.44541931152344	23
Gamson (1987) adviced instructors to “encourage contact between student and faculty”. Tiberius	90.02400207519531	645.8141479492188	11.039993286132812	433.57701110839844	23
& Billson (Tiberius & Billson, 1991 as cited by Fleming, 2003) emphasized on need of a trust	90.02400207519531	664.774169921875	11.039993286132812	433.31773376464844	23
based, open and cooperative relationship between an instructor and his students which is guided,	90.02400207519531	683.7341918945312	11.039993286132812	433.1543426513672	23
not by control, but by mutual agreement.	90.02400207519531	702.6941528320312	11.039993286132812	179.74424743652344	23
Active learning demands involvement. Involvement demands interaction. Fruitful interaction	90.02400207519531	73.0941162109375	11.0400390625	433.2869110107422	24
demands rapport. But that does not mean that an instructor has to indulge in students’	90.02400207519531	92.05413818359375	11.0400390625	433.1876678466797	24
appeasement. He has to rather strive for a growth oriented relationship with sincerity and honesty.	90.02400207519531	111.01409912109375	11.0400390625	431.38743591308594	24
2.3 Co-operative active learning	90.02400207519531	140.65411376953125	11.0400390625	152.67320251464844	25
Active learning may be implemented through different routes. One of the popular routes is	90.02400207519531	159.3741455078125	11.0400390625	433.63340759277344	25
cooperative active learning. Students’ involvement amongst themselves is crucial for successful	90.02400207519531	178.3341064453125	11.0400390625	433.60508728027344	25
active learning environment. As Chickering & Gamson (1987) stated, “learning isn’t solo race	90.02400207519531	197.29412841796875	11.0400390625	433.42039489746094	25
rather it’s a team effort which depends on collaboration and cooperation amongst students.” In	90.02400207519531	216.254150390625	11.0400390625	433.5336151123047	25
cooperative learning a class is divided into smaller groups to enhance understanding and learning	90.02400207519531	235.244140625	11.0400390625	433.5126190185547	25
of students through positive interdependence, individual accountability, continuous interaction,	90.02400207519531	254.2041015625	11.0400390625	433.27586364746094	25
teamwork, to accomplish orderly thinking, problem solving, critical analysis and clear expression	90.02400207519531	273.16412353515625	11.0400390625	433.23179626464844	25
(Johnson et al. 1998).	90.02400207519531	292.1241455078125	11.0400390625	95.12063598632812	25
Imagine six stand alone desktop computers and now compare it with a group of six networked	90.02400207519531	321.524169921875	11.03997802734375	433.5970916748047	26
computers. Which would give higher volume of fast information sharing and processing? Off	90.02400207519531	340.484130859375	11.040008544921875	433.23179626464844	26
course the networked group. Cooperative learning aims at developing a network of human brains	90.02400207519531	359.4441223144531	11.040008544921875	433.5481414794922	26
to achieve higher levels of learning, and to prevent this network from crashing the size of the	90.02400207519531	378.40411376953125	11.040008544921875	433.1764373779297	26
teams is kept smaller. Student attendance is essential in a cooperative learning environment as	90.02400207519531	397.3841247558594	11.040008544921875	433.12132263183594	26
absence of one or few team member(s) might disturb the task accomplishment and create a	90.02400207519531	416.3441162109375	11.040008544921875	433.44139099121094	26
negative impact on the team spirit. (McManus, 1996). Finlay and Faulkner (2005) conducted a	90.02400207519531	435.30413818359375	11.040008544921875	433.49461364746094	26
project in which self help reading groups of 3-5 students were formed. Each student had to read a	90.02400207519531	454.3841247558594	11.040008544921875	433.43797302246094	26
different topic each week and then had to write one page synopsis which was later discussed with	90.02400207519531	473.3441162109375	11.040008544921875	433.3384246826172	26
the group. After the reading students asked questions among themselves. 73% of the students	90.02400207519531	492.30413818359375	11.040008544921875	433.2427215576172	26
expressed positive perception of the method. Boud et al. (1999) refer to a term “peer learning” in	90.02400207519531	511.2641296386719	11.040008544921875	433.63536071777344	26
which students learn in a group without intervention of an instructor.	90.02400207519531	530.22412109375	11.040008544921875	302.84925842285156	26
Cooperative learning aims at self help in pursuit of knowledge. It may partially involve the	90.02400207519531	559.5340576171875	11.040008544921875	433.15452575683594	27
instructor or it may be practiced without instructor’s intervention. One logical adaptation would	90.02400207519531	578.6141357421875	11.040008544921875	433.62254333496094	27
be to initiate cooperative learning with higher degree of instructor’s involvement and intervention	90.02400207519531	597.5741577148438	11.039993286132812	433.28538513183594	27
and to gradually reduce the involvement after judging the degree of self sufficiency of the group.	90.02400207519531	616.5341796875	11.039993286132812	433.1215057373047	27
Cooperative learning may promote social loafing. Latane et al. (1979) in their research found that	90.02400207519531	635.494140625	11.039993286132812	433.47373962402344	27
individuals tend to reduce effort when performing in a group. This is called social loafing. Maniar	90.02400207519531	654.4541625976562	11.039993286132812	433.1544647216797	27
(2002) researched team work in business and sports and found that individual input reduces with	90.02400207519531	673.4141235351562	11.039993286132812	433.16551208496094	27
the increase in size of a team. To prevent social loafing he suggests to evaluate each individual on	90.02400207519531	692.3741455078125	11.039993286132812	433.22630310058594	27
his/her contribution, give smaller awards along the way instead of rewarding the group at the end	90.02400207519531	711.3341674804688	11.040000915527344	433.1876678466797	27
of the task.	90.02400207519531	730.3141479492188	11.040000915527344	48.56495666503906	27

Since 1988, University of Hawai at Manoa has been running “writing intensive” classes which	90.02400207519531	92.05413818359375	11.0400390625	433.3651580810547	28
aims at “learning through writing”. (UHM 2006) An internal study has found that students have	90.02400207519531	111.01409912109375	11.0400390625	433.62010192871094	28
positive perception of the program and writing intensive assignments enhance learning amongst	90.02400207519531	129.97412109375	11.0400390625	433.42527770996094	28
the students, but they need to be taught how to write to learn. The strategy used by the university	90.02400207519531	148.93414306640625	11.0400390625	433.39646911621094	28
is to guide students to improve their analytical skills through synthesis of the journal articles,	90.02400207519531	168.01409912109375	11.0400390625	433.65599060058594	28
improve their reading skills through writing summaries, learn data collection techniques , to	90.02400207519531	186.97412109375	11.0400390625	433.6588592529297	28
improve their analytical skills by examining research articles and then to present their own views	90.02400207519531	205.93414306640625	11.0400390625	433.4745330810547	28
through writing intensive assignments. Plagiarism may be cited as a big drawback of writing	90.02400207519531	224.89410400390625	11.0400390625	433.3644256591797	28
intensive assignments but a software like ‘Turnitin’ (www.turnitin.com) helps to keep a check on	90.02400207519531	243.8841552734375	11.0400390625	433.54673767089844	28
students indulging in plagiarism.	90.02400207519531	262.8441162109375	11.0400390625	144.23672485351562	28
2.5 Problem based active learning	90.02400207519531	292.3641357421875	11.0400390625	158.64968872070312	29
Problem based learning is a self directed effort of a student towards understanding the solution of	90.02400207519531	311.2041015625	11.0400390625	433.6123504638672	29
a problem. In this process the student identifies what he knows and what he needs to know to	90.02400207519531	330.16412353515625	11.040008544921875	433.1875457763672	29
solve the problem. (Barrows and Tamblyn 1980) Instead of feeding the students with readymade	90.02400207519531	349.1241149902344	11.040008544921875	433.15440368652344	29
content through lectures and discussions, problem based learning begins with a challenge of	90.02400207519531	368.0841369628906	11.040008544921875	433.5237274169922	29
presenting a real life problem through case studies, research papers, assignment etc to the students,	90.02400207519531	387.04412841796875	11.040008544921875	436.00291442871094	29
the answer to which they have to find on their own, individually and/or collectively. This method	90.02400207519531	406.0241394042969	11.040008544921875	433.24266052246094	29
drastically changes the role of the students as well as the instructor.	90.02400207519531	424.984130859375	11.040008544921875	296.31224060058594	29
The usual practice of teaching is to explain the concept to the students and then follow with	90.02400207519531	454.3841247558594	11.040008544921875	433.4113006591797	30
questions. Problem based learning (PBL) is exactly opposite as in PBL the beginning is with a	90.02400207519531	473.3441162109375	11.040008544921875	433.5198211669922	30
problem and in due course of time students acquire knowledge and skills to solve the problem. A	90.02400207519531	492.30413818359375	11.040008544921875	433.58689880371094	30
teacher is no more a provider of quick and easy answers rather he becomes a facilitator in search	90.02400207519531	511.2641296386719	11.040008544921875	433.3381805419922	30
of relevant information. The biggest challenge for successful implementation of PBL is the	90.02400207519531	530.22412109375	11.040008544921875	433.58702087402344	30
willingness and ability of the instructor to create a learning environment which is not teacher	90.02400207519531	549.18408203125	11.040008544921875	433.52134704589844	30
centered and in which the student actively guides his own learning, individually or in a group.	90.02400207519531	568.174072265625	11.040008544921875	433.65599060058594	30
(Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980).	90.02400207519531	587.1341552734375	11.039993286132812	128.66598510742188	30
Second most important challenge while implementing PBL is the selection of a problem. Stinson	90.02400207519531	616.5341796875	11.039993286132812	433.60435485839844	31
& Milter, (1996) suggest the selected problem should reflect real life circumstances and be	90.02400207519531	635.494140625	11.039993286132812	433.4285125732422	31
contemporary to facilitate the process of learning and doing. They further suggest the problem to	90.02400207519531	654.4541625976562	11.039993286132812	433.65599060058594	31
be ill-structured, as real life problems are rarely structured. An ill-structured problem would	90.02400207519531	673.4141235351562	11.039993286132812	433.62498474121094	31
enable the student to comprehend ill defined situations. Duch (1996) insists that an effective	90.02400207519531	692.3741455078125	11.039993286132812	433.45396423339844	31
problem must engage and motivate students, should be connected to previously learned	90.02400207519531	711.3341674804688	11.040000915527344	433.54490661621094	31
knowledge, be open ended and not limited to one correct answer, must encourage higher level of	90.02400207519531	730.3141479492188	11.040000915527344	433.43370056152344	31
learning by asking for solutions based on facts and logic. Duch (1996) further clarifies that instead	90.02400207519531	749.3941650390625	11.040000915527344	433.33116149902344	31
of dividing the problem into smaller units to be individually solved by a student, an effective	90.02400207519531	73.0941162109375	11.0400390625	433.5890350341797	32
problem should encourage total involvement of a students group and prevent “divide and	90.02400207519531	92.05413818359375	11.0400390625	433.27586364746094	32
conquer” of the assignment. We may conclude that PBL attempts to bridge the gap between	90.02400207519531	111.01409912109375	11.0400390625	433.3531951904297	32
education and research.	90.02400207519531	129.97412109375	11.0400390625	103.70599365234375	32
3. Multiple intelligence and multi-sense oriented learning.	90.02400207519531	159.6141357421875	11.0400390625	270.28599548339844	33
Gardner’s (1993) concept of multiple intelligence identified that each individual has following	90.02400207519531	178.3341064453125	11.0400390625	433.74021911621094	33
eight facets of intelligence. Logical-mathematical intelligence makes a learner quick with	90.02400207519531	197.29412841796875	11.0400390625	433.5283660888672	33
numbers, strong in reasoning and scientific thinking. Verbal-linguistic makes a learner	90.02400207519531	216.254150390625	11.0400390625	433.55149841308594	33
comfortable with languages and communication including verbal and written assignments etc.	90.02400207519531	235.244140625	11.0400390625	433.5356903076172	33
Musical-rhythmic intelligence relates to recognition and use of sounds and audio presentations.	90.02400207519531	254.2041015625	11.0400390625	433.65599060058594	33
Naturalist intelligence relates to ability to work with nature, field trips, real life situations. Visual-	90.02400207519531	273.16412353515625	11.0400390625	433.6123504638672	33
spatial relates to sense of sight and ability to make mental images and concept maps. Inter-	90.02400207519531	292.1241455078125	11.0400390625	433.7323455810547	33
relational relates to inter personal skills such as communication and team work. Intra relational is	90.02400207519531	311.2041015625	11.0400390625	433.5155487060547	33
associated with understanding of self. Bodily-kinesthetic is associated with body movements.	90.02400207519531	330.16412353515625	11.040008544921875	411.15586853027344	33
Visual based instructions using audio visual models, films, 3D graphs enhance the productivity of	90.02400207519531	349.1241149902344	11.040008544921875	433.22813415527344	33
active learning environment (Cashin,1985; Bonwell & Eison 1991). VARK (Visual, Aural,	90.02400207519531	368.0841369628906	11.040008544921875	433.57505798339844	33
Read/Write, Kinesthetic) learning strategy attempts to create an active learning environment. In	90.02400207519531	387.04412841796875	11.040008544921875	433.50962829589844	33
visual learning an instructor uses gestures and picturesque language, pictures, videos, posters,	90.02400207519531	406.0241394042969	11.040008544921875	433.53904724121094	33
slides, colour flow-charts, colour graphs and diagrams, underlining and different colour	90.02400207519531	424.984130859375	11.040008544921875	433.3124237060547	33
highlighters etc.	90.02400207519531	443.9441223144531	11.040008544921875	70.97615051269531	33
In aural learning classroom discussions between learner and instructor and amongst learner play	90.02400207519531	473.3441162109375	11.040008544921875	433.35813903808594	34
an important role. Outside classroom strategy involves spending time in a quiet place and	90.02400207519531	492.30413818359375	11.040008544921875	433.3763885498047	34
recalling the ideas and speaking out the answers aloud or inside head to register the content in	90.02400207519531	511.2641296386719	11.040008544921875	433.22068786621094	34

Read/write learning strategy works well when the content involves lots of definitions, glossaries,	90.02400207519531	559.5340576171875	11.040008544921875	433.5898895263672	35
manuals, dictionaries. This strategy requires the students to undertake multiple writing and	90.02400207519531	578.6141357421875	11.040008544921875	433.53404235839844	35
reading sessions. To reinforce learning frequent multiple choice tests are suggested.	90.02400207519531	597.5741577148438	11.039993286132812	368.13990783691406	35
In kinesthetic learning strategy field tours and trips, lectures with real life examples, laboratory	90.02400207519531	626.8541870117188	11.039993286132812	433.3915252685547	36
sessions, learning from trial and error etc is given emphasis. Use of case studies and applications	90.02400207519531	645.8141479492188	11.039993286132812	433.17649841308594	36
to help with principles and abstract concepts is suggested. (Complete information on VARK	90.02400207519531	664.774169921875	11.039993286132812	433.4929656982422	36

Active learning is more than a technique or a tool. Active learning is a way of life. There are three	90.02400207519531	140.41412353515625	11.0400390625	433.4653778076172	39
major components of an active learning environment and they are students, instructors and	90.02400207519531	159.3741455078125	11.0400390625	433.2538299560547	39
institute/management. Active learning environment demands behavior modification on the part of	90.02400207519531	178.3341064453125	11.0400390625	433.51268005371094	39
students, instructors and institute/management. The speed and intensity of implementing a step	90.02400207519531	197.29412841796875	11.0400390625	433.2428436279297	39
by step comprehensive active learning environment in higher education has to be determined by	90.02400207519531	216.254150390625	11.0400390625	433.2174530029297	39
the desire, ability and willingness of the students, instructors and institute/management.	90.02400207519531	235.244140625	11.0400390625	385.09642028808594	39
Instead of developing and implementing a learning environment which is decided by the	90.02400207519531	254.2041015625	11.0400390625	433.2538299560547	39
management/faculty/consultant, the need identification for an activity based environment in the	90.02400207519531	273.16412353515625	11.0400390625	433.19859313964844	39
mindset of the students has to be given importance. There is a need of a paradigm shift from the	90.02400207519531	292.1241455078125	11.0400390625	433.2599334716797	39
usual approach of ‘how I like to teach’ to ‘how the learner wants to learn and how the learner will	90.02400207519531	311.2041015625	11.0400390625	433.59690856933594	39
