Abstract	54.0	241.55523681640625	12.822509765625	51.99150848388672	6
When policymakers design programs and policies, they often want to understand why	54.0	267.02740478515625	11.836181640625	486.98895263671875	7
individuals engage in particular behaviors. Collecting survey data about respondentsʼ	54.0	279.84991455078125	11.836181640625	487.0018310546875	7
reasons for their behavior presents important challenges, and there is little methodological	54.0	292.67236328125	11.836181640625	486.99908447265625	7
research on this topic. We conducted an experiment to investigate the best practices for	54.0	305.494873046875	11.836181640625	487.004638671875	7
asking questions about respondentsʼ reasons for their behavior. We embedded a split ballot	54.0	318.3175048828125	11.836212158203125	487.01568603515625	7
experiment in a face-to-face survey of 608 entrepreneurs in Ethiopia. Respondents were	54.0	331.1400146484375	11.836181640625	487.0067138671875	7
asked questions about why they did not engage in three business practices (advertising,	54.0	343.9626159667969	11.836181640625	487.00811767578125	7
sharing product storage, and switching suppliers). When asked these questions, respondents	54.0	356.7851257324219	11.836181640625	486.9984130859375	7
were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: close-ended questions, open-ended	54.0	369.6076354980469	11.836181640625	487.006591796875	7
questions with interviewer probing, and open-ended questions without probing. Respondents	54.0	382.43023681640625	11.836181640625	486.99847412109375	7
endorsed more responses when asked close-ended (versus open-ended) questions.	54.0	395.2527160644531	11.836181640625	487.01019287109375	7
Close-ended responses produced higher rates of socially undesirable responses and fewer	54.0	408.0752258300781	11.836181640625	487.005615234375	7
“other” responses. Notably, probing had no effect on the number or types of responses given.	54.0	420.8978271484375	11.836181640625	487.00872802734375	7

Introduction	54.0	79.07061767578125	15.78155517578125	91.94822692871094	18
When policymakers design programs and policies, they often want to understand why	54.0	107.5841064453125	11.836181640625	486.98895263671875	19
individuals act in particular ways. Although some researchers caution against asking	54.0	120.4066162109375	11.836181640625	487.0078125	19
respondents to cite reasons why they do (or do not) engage in behaviors (Pasek and	54.0	133.22918701171875	11.836181640625	487.0030517578125	19
Krosnick 2010: 41; Wilson 2010), data about respondent motivations for their behavior are	54.0	146.05169677734375	11.836181640625	487.008056640625	19
analytically useful. By understanding the causes of peopleʼs behavior, policymakers can take	54.0	158.874267578125	11.836181640625	487.00628662109375	19
steps to reduce undesirable behaviors or encourage desirable behaviors. For example,	54.0	171.69677734375	11.836181640625	487.00067138671875	19
questions in the National Health Interview Survey ask respondents why they delayed seeking	54.0	184.519287109375	11.836181640625	487.00677490234375	19
medical care, allowing researchers to understand barriers to healthcare access (Centers for	54.0	197.3419189453125	11.836181640625	487.00933837890625	19
Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). The Current Population Survey also asks individuals	54.0	210.16436767578125	11.836181640625	487.0008544921875	19
why they did not vote or register to vote, shedding light on mechanisms underlying political	54.0	222.98687744140625	11.836181640625	486.99969482421875	19
participation (United States Census Bureau, 2010).	54.0	235.80950927734375	11.836181640625	266.7815856933594	19
Given the value of data about individualsʼ motivations for behavior, it is notable that there is	54.0	260.46807861328125	11.836181640625	486.99371337890625	20
little research on best practices for designing these questions. To address this gap, we	54.0	273.29071044921875	11.836181640625	487.0045166015625	20
embedded a split ballot experiment in a face-to-face survey of 608 entrepreneurs in Ethiopia.	54.0	286.11322021484375	11.836181640625	487.008544921875	20
Conducting the survey in a developing country allowed us to study this topic in a context that	54.0	298.9356689453125	11.836181640625	487.00775146484375	20
poses additional challenges to asking such questions. In our survey, we randomly assigned	54.0	311.75830078125	11.836181640625	487.00640869140625	20
one of three methods for asking respondents about reasons for their behavior. The methods	54.0	324.580810546875	11.836181640625	486.9970703125	20
differ in whether questions are close-ended versus open-ended, and whether interviewers	54.0	337.4034118652344	11.836181640625	486.9974365234375	20
probed respondents. Our analysis evaluates the three methods by comparing numbers of	54.0	350.2259216308594	11.836181640625	487.00299072265625	20
endorsed responses and the number of socially desirable responses in particular.	54.0	363.0484313964844	11.836181640625	424.53179931640625	20
Background	54.0	387.7978515625	15.781585693359375	91.99240112304688	21
There are many ways to collect survey data about reasons for respondentʼs behavior. The	54.0	416.31121826171875	11.836181640625	487.006591796875	22
method we adopt in this paper involves pre-specifying a list of possible reasons for behavior	54.0	429.1338195800781	11.836181640625	487.00555419921875	22
on the instrument, and then having interviewers record whether each response applies or not	54.0	441.9563293457031	11.836181640625	487.00701904296875	22
(using yes/no responses for each item).[1] When designing this type of question, researchers	54.0	454.77880859375	11.836181640625	486.9930419921875	22
must make two key decisions (Wilson 2010). First, should interviewers ask close-ended	54.0	467.6014099121094	11.836181640625	487.0078125	22
questions—reading each possible response and then recording a yes/no response for each?	54.0	480.4239196777344	11.836181640625	487.006591796875	22
Or should interviewers ask open-ended questions and then record yes/no responses based	54.0	493.2464294433594	11.836181640625	487.0067138671875	22
on the respondentʼs open-ended answer? Second, if open-ended questions are used, should	54.0	506.06903076171875	11.836181640625	487.00701904296875	22
interviewers probe respondents for clariﬁcation? In the following sections, we draw from	54.0	518.8914794921875	11.836181640625	487.0068359375	22
previous literature to develop expectations about the advantages and disadvantages of	54.0	531.7139892578125	11.836181640625	487.0018310546875	22
different types of close-ended and open-ended questions.	54.0	544.53662109375	11.836181640625	301.41192626953125	22
Close-Ended Versus Open-Ended Questions	54.0	569.1151733398438	11.836181640625	248.8817138671875	23
Asking close-ended questions (rather than open-ended ones) is a form of standardized	54.0	593.85400390625	11.836181640625	487.009033203125	24
interviewing, in which each respondent hears the exact same question and response options,	54.0	606.676513671875	11.836181640625	487.0081787109375	24
regardless of the interview ﬂow or tone (Converse and Schuman 1974; Schober and Conrad	54.0	619.4991455078125	11.836181640625	487.0067138671875	24
2002). This approach has the advantage of encouraging respondents to consider reasons	54.0	632.3215942382812	11.836181640625	486.99591064453125	24
they had not previously thought about. It also encourages respondents to think about the	54.0	645.1441040039062	11.836181640625	487.005615234375	24
issue from a variety of perspectives, which may result in a greater number of endorsed	54.0	657.9666748046875	11.836181640625	487.0067138671875	24
responses and may also limit “donʼt know” responses. Further, close-ended questions may	54.0	670.7891845703125	11.836181640625	486.99725341796875	24
reduce respondentsʼ concerns about reporting socially undesirable answers. Reading	54.0	683.6116943359375	11.836181640625	487.0091552734375	24
response options may give tacit approval for socially undesirable answers and may help	54.0	696.434326171875	11.836181640625	487.0067138671875	24
develop a sense of trust between a respondent and the interviewer. It also means that	54.0	709.2568359375	11.836181640625	486.99957275390625	24
respondents do not have to verbally state a socially undesirable admission about	54.0	722.0792846679688	11.836174011230469	487.01611328125	24
themselves, which is the case in an open-ended question format.	54.0	734.90185546875	11.836181640625	339.75640869140625	24

Close-ended questions also have disadvantages, many of which are rectiﬁed by open-ended	54.0	55.57891845703125	11.836181640625	487.006591796875	29
formats. Reading close-ended response options during the interview can be time consuming	54.0	68.4013671875	11.836181640625	487.00335693359375	29
and feel repetitive to the respondent. Open-ended questions, in contrast, may be more	54.0	81.223876953125	11.836181640625	487.01019287109375	29
engaging for respondents because they comport more with conversational norms and allow	54.0	94.0465087890625	11.836181640625	486.99884033203125	29
respondents to better communicate the reasoning behind their behavior (Fowler 1995).	54.0	106.8690185546875	11.836181640625	487.00909423828125	29
Open-ended questions have also been shown to solicit meaningful, salient information from	54.0	119.69146728515625	11.836181640625	487.0023193359375	29
respondents (Geer 1988; Geer 1991). In addition, close-ended questions may suffer from	54.0	132.51409912109375	11.836181640625	487.0057373046875	29
primacy or recency effects, where the ﬁrst (or last) response options are more likely to be	54.0	145.33660888671875	11.836181640625	487.00103759765625	29
endorsed, whereas primacy and recency effects are eliminated with open-ended questions.	54.0	158.15911865234375	11.836181640625	487.0081787109375	29
Finally, reading response options may implicitly convey the researcherʼs values or	54.0	170.981689453125	11.836181640625	487.01129150390625	29
preferences, potentially biasing respondents in a particular direction. Open-ended questions,	54.0	183.80419921875	11.836181640625	487.00836181640625	29
in contrast, do not have this limitation, and also provide an opportunity to collect data about	54.0	196.626708984375	11.836181640625	487.009521484375	29
issues researchers had not previously considered.	54.0	209.44927978515625	11.836181640625	262.8708801269531	29

complete or detailed response. Probing can facilitate respondent comprehension of the	54.0	284.41180419921875	11.836181640625	487.0125732421875	31
question and may reduce errors in the interviewerʼs coding of responses. An exchange with	54.0	297.23431396484375	11.836181640625	487.00518798828125	31
the interviewer also may encourage respondents to think more deeply about their answers.	54.0	310.0567626953125	11.836181640625	487.00823974609375	31
This increased engagement with the question-answer process, as well as with the	54.0	322.87939453125	11.836212158203125	487.01025390625	31
interviewer, may yield more endorsed answers, reduce respondent satisﬁcing, and increase	54.0	335.7019348144531	11.836181640625	487.006591796875	31
reports of socially undesirable behaviors. Schaeffer and Maynard (2008) show that directive	54.0	348.5244140625	11.836181640625	487.00714111328125	31
probes or requests for conﬁrmation from interviewers increase a respondentʼs likelihood of	54.0	361.3470153808594	11.836181640625	487.00921630859375	31
reporting embarrassing or incriminating responses.	54.0	374.1695251464844	11.836181640625	266.0903625488281	31
There are three potential drawbacks of probing. First, probing gives interviewers more	54.0	398.8282165527344	11.836181640625	487.0067138671875	32
discretion and may lead to increased interviewer errors and variance. For example, Fowler	54.0	411.6507263183594	11.836181640625	487.002685546875	32
and Mangione (1990) ﬁnd that the number of probes, directive probes used, and occasions	54.0	424.47332763671875	11.836181640625	486.99725341796875	32
where an interviewer failed to probe are associated with increased error. They also suggest	54.0	437.29583740234375	11.836181640625	487.00775146484375	32
that probing may introduce interviewer-level variance, which decreases the efﬁciency of	54.0	450.1184387207031	11.836181640625	487.00811767578125	32
survey estimates. However, Schober and Conradʼs (1997) small-scale experimental study	54.0	462.94091796875	11.836181640625	486.99957275390625	32
ﬁnds no evidence that probing increases interviewer error or variance. Second, probing may	54.0	475.763427734375	11.836181640625	487.0064697265625	32
increase the number of “other” responses if the interviewer cannot code the response into	54.0	488.5859375	11.836181640625	487.00115966796875	32
one of the pre-existing categories due to the nuanced response from the respondents. Third,	54.0	501.4085693359375	11.836181640625	487.02001953125	32
the conversational nature of the interview may increase administration time, increasing	54.0	514.2310180664062	11.836181640625	487.006591796875	32
survey costs and ﬁeld data collection time.	54.0	527.0535278320312	11.836181640625	221.48211669921875	32
In sum, the literature suggests that there are advantages and disadvantages of using	54.0	551.7122802734375	11.836181640625	487.000732421875	33
close-ended versus open-ended questions, as well as probing versus not probing. Given the	54.0	564.5347900390625	11.836181640625	486.99566650390625	33
lack of research in this area, we designed a split ballot experiment to investigate the quality	54.0	577.3572998046875	11.836166381835938	487.0074462890625	33

We analyze data from the Kal Addis Business Survey (KABS), a paper-and-pencil interview	54.0	668.0662841796875	11.871337890625	487.00323486328125	36
of 608 entrepreneurs in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. Eligible respondents were	54.0	680.9238891601562	11.836181640625	487.00677490234375	36
owners or senior managers of small and medium businesses (between 3 and 99 employees)	54.0	693.7465209960938	11.836181640625	486.99591064453125	36

2012. All interviewers also participated in a three day training and pre-test of the instrument.	54.0	94.0465087890625	11.836181640625	487.00860595703125	41
Throughout data collection, survey managers held quality review meetings with interviewers	54.0	106.8690185546875	11.836181640625	486.99981689453125	41
to enhance standardization and to answer questions about ﬁeld implementation. The mean	54.0	119.69146728515625	11.836181640625	487.0067138671875	41
administration time was 29 minutes (standard deviation = 9 minutes).	54.0	132.51409912109375	11.836181640625	360.40936279296875	41
Because a sampling frame of entrepreneurs was not available in Addis Ababa, KABS used	54.0	157.17279052734375	11.836181640625	487.0032958984375	42
respondent-driven sampling (RDS). RDS is a method of chain referral sampling that	54.0	169.99530029296875	11.836181640625	487.01141357421875	42
combines a snowball sample with a mathematical model that adjusts for the non-random	54.0	182.81787109375	11.836181640625	487.00543212890625	42
selection of the initial set of respondents (Heckathorn 1997). To implement RDS in KABS, we	54.0	195.640380859375	11.836181640625	487.00543212890625	42
initially recruited a convenience sample of 24 individuals through personal networks. These	54.0	208.462890625	11.836181640625	487.00677490234375	42
individuals were interviewed and then provided with three invitations to recruit up to three	54.0	221.2855224609375	11.836181640625	487.00244140625	42
individuals to participate in the study. Each additional wave of recruits was asked to recruit	54.0	234.10797119140625	11.836181640625	487.008056640625	42
up to three additional individuals. Recruited individuals contacted the ﬁeld data collection	54.0	246.93048095703125	11.836181640625	487.0072021484375	42
teams, who then scheduled and conducted the interview in a location of the respondentʼs	54.0	259.75311279296875	11.836181640625	486.9976806640625	42
choosing. We provided a leather wallet to respondents for completing the survey and mobile	54.0	272.57562255859375	11.836181640625	487.01409912109375	42

KABS included questions about three business practices: advertising, switching to a new	54.0	392.9101257324219	11.836181640625	486.9986572265625	124
supplier to buy raw materials, and sharing product storage with another business. We	54.0	405.7326354980469	11.836181640625	487.0113525390625	124
present the exact question wording for these questions in the Appendix. These three	54.0	418.55523681640625	11.836181640625	487.0008544921875	124
practices facilitate economic growth and are practices that policymakers would like to	54.0	431.3777160644531	11.836181640625	487.0067138671875	124
encourage in developing countries. Therefore, understanding why individuals do not engage	54.0	444.2002258300781	11.836181640625	487.00640869140625	124
in these practices is important for policymakers who design interventions to stimulate	54.0	457.0228271484375	11.836181640625	487.0067138671875	124
economic growth. In different parts of the interview, respondents were asked if they engaged	54.0	469.8453369140625	11.836181640625	487.006103515625	124
in these business practices. Those who said they did not take part in each business practice	54.0	482.6679382324219	11.836181640625	487.0072021484375	124
were asked why not. We generated pre-speciﬁed reasons for each behavior during formative	54.0	495.49041748046875	11.836181640625	487.0069580078125	124

about reasons for respondentʼs behavior. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of	54.0	596.097900390625	11.836181640625	487.0103759765625	126
three methods (Table 2). Each respondent was assigned to the same method across all three	54.0	608.9205322265625	11.836181640625	487.00543212890625	126

In the open-ended with probing method, interviewers asked an open-ended question instead	54.0	297.19921875	11.87127685546875	487.003662109375	147
of reading the response options. The interviewer then coded the respondentʼs open-ended	54.0	310.0567626953125	11.836181640625	487.006591796875	147

interviewing (i.e., interviewer has discretion to select the appropriate response.) All three	54.0	438.2821350097656	11.836181640625	486.99151611328125	147
methods contained an “other (specify)” response. During preliminary analysis, we recoded	54.0	451.104736328125	11.836181640625	487.00653076171875	147
some “other” responses into existing pre-speciﬁed categories or created new categories	54.0	463.9272155761719	11.836181640625	486.997314453125	147
when the other (specify) meaning was unambiguous.	54.0	476.74981689453125	11.836181640625	276.6553649902344	147

Our analysis seeks to identify the method that produces the most useful data about why	54.0	526.0672607421875	11.836181640625	486.997314453125	149
individuals do not engage in the three business practices. Because obtaining validation data	54.0	538.8897094726562	11.836181640625	487.0032958984375	149
for this type of information is difﬁcult, we focus on the number of endorsed responses and	54.0	551.7122802734375	11.836181640625	486.9932861328125	149
socially undesirable responses in particular. Another possible indicator is timing data, but	54.0	564.5347900390625	11.836181640625	487.0020751953125	149
because KABS used paper-and-pencil interviewing (like most surveys in developing	54.0	577.3572998046875	11.836166381835938	487.01263427734375	149
countries), timing data on individual questions were not available. Below, we describe each	54.0	590.1798095703125	11.836181640625	487.00634765625	149
indicator and present hypotheses.	54.0	603.00244140625	11.836181640625	177.4290008544922	149
Number of endorsed responses: The number of responses that respondents select is	54.0	627.6259765625	11.871337890625	486.99664306640625	150
indicative of greater engagement with the subject matter. A greater number of responses is	54.0	640.483642578125	11.836181640625	487.00750732421875	150
also analytically useful because it helps analysts understand multiple inﬂuences on behavior.	54.0	653.3062133789062	11.836181640625	483.7158203125	150
Hypothesis 1: The close-ended method will result in greater number of endorsed reasons	54.0	677.9298095703125	11.87127685546875	486.9998779296875	151
than either open-ended method because respondents must consider each option separately.	54.0	690.7523193359375	11.87127685546875	487.00775146484375	151
Support for this reasoning comes from the web survey literature, which shows that	54.0	703.6099243164062	11.836181640625	487.01495361328125	151
respondents endorse more responses when presented with a yes/no matrix (that requires an	54.0	716.4324951171875	11.836181640625	487.0045166015625	151
answer for each response) rather than a “check all” list (Smyth et al. 2006).	54.0	729.2550048828125	11.836181640625	391.6260070800781	151

Hypothesis 2: Open-ended with probing will lead to a greater number of endorsements than	54.0	55.5438232421875	11.87127685546875	487.0030517578125	156
open-ended without probing. During probing, interviewers may encourage respondents to	54.0	68.36627197265625	11.87127685546875	487.008544921875	156
think about the issue from multiple angles and therefore provide more responses.	54.0	81.223876953125	11.836181640625	424.4833068847656	156
Socially undesirable reporting: We assume that respondents are reluctant to endorse	54.0	105.84759521484375	11.87127685546875	486.999755859375	157
responses that are socially undesirable, and that increases in socially undesirable reporting	54.0	118.7052001953125	11.836181640625	487.010498046875	157
reﬂect a more preferable method. This logic has been widely used in other areas, such as	54.0	131.5277099609375	11.836181640625	486.9935302734375	157
mode effects on reports of sexual activity (Tourangeau and Smith 1996) and smoking	54.0	144.35028076171875	11.836181640625	487.00311279296875	157
(Currivan et al. 2004). We include a range of socially undesirable measures in our study,	54.0	157.17279052734375	11.836181640625	487.0098876953125	157
ranging from more sensitive (e.g., reporting distrust of others) to less sensitive (e.g.,	54.0	169.99530029296875	11.836181640625	487.00726318359375	157
reporting lack of knowledge about an issue).	54.0	182.81787109375	11.836181640625	231.32037353515625	157
Hypothesis 3: The close-ended method will yield more socially undesirable reporting than	54.0	207.4415283203125	11.87127685546875	487.01080322265625	158
either open-ended method because the interviewer-supplied responses give tacit approval to	54.0	220.26397705078125	11.87127685546875	487.01068115234375	158
the possibility of the response. In addition, the respondent only has to say “yes” to endorse a	54.0	233.12158203125	11.836181640625	487.005126953125	158
socially undesirable behavior in the close-ended method, whereas the respondent must	54.0	245.90911865234375	11.87127685546875	487.00701904296875	158
verbalize the socially undesirable behavior in the open-ended methods.	54.0	258.7315673828125	11.87127685546875	372.6036682128906	158
Hypothesis 4: Open-ended with probing will lead to more socially undesirable reports than	54.0	283.39031982421875	11.87127685546875	487.01220703125	159
open-ended without probing. Probing may help an interviewer build rapport with a	54.0	296.2127685546875	11.87127685546875	487.0029296875	159
respondent and uncover issues that respondents do not immediately discuss.	54.0	309.07049560546875	11.836181640625	404.1641540527344	159

endorsed, and the mean number of reasons. For “more than one reason” and “mean number	54.0	425.4596252441406	11.836181640625	487.00885009765625	162

for Hypothesis 2: probing had no effect on the number of reasons respondents endorse.	54.0	245.9442138671875	11.836181640625	458.47308349609375	276

Next, we investigated how question design affected the number of socially undesirable	54.0	295.2615966796875	11.836181640625	487.0113525390625	278

In Table 4, we show the reasons respondents provided for not advertising, separately by	54.0	357.401611328125	11.836181640625	486.99725341796875	280
experimental group. Several of these reasons are socially undesirable, such as the reason	54.0	370.22412109375	11.836181640625	487.00653076171875	280
that advertising might lead to an “increase government inspections or auditing.” This reason	54.0	383.046630859375	11.836181640625	487.007080078125	280
is socially taboo because it indirectly refers to bribes: In developing countries such as	54.0	395.8692321777344	11.836181640625	486.99615478515625	280
Ethiopia, advertising increases a businessʼ prominence, making it an easier target for	54.0	408.69171142578125	11.836181640625	487.0057373046875	280
government ofﬁcials to demand bribes through unnecessary inspections or audits.	54.0	421.51422119140625	11.836181640625	487.00665283203125	280
Respondents may not endorse this reason because they prefer to avoid discussing about the	54.0	434.3368225097656	11.836181640625	487.01556396484375	280
sensitive topic of bribes, and also to minimize being perceived as having paid bribes. Of	54.0	447.1593322753906	11.836181640625	487.01055908203125	280
respondents in the close-ended group, 14% cited this reason, twice as high as the	54.0	459.9818115234375	11.836181640625	487.01263427734375	280

Table 4 also contains two other reasons that, while not socially undesirable, may be sensitive	54.0	279.33209228515625	11.836181640625	487.00726318359375	328
to the method of questioning. These reasons include not advertising because it is too	54.0	292.15460205078125	11.836181640625	487.0091552734375	328
complicated or because the respondent had never thought of advertising. Although these	54.0	304.97711181640625	11.836181640625	487.0067138671875	328
reasons are not socially taboo, respondents may hesitate to report these reasons because	54.0	317.7996826171875	11.836181640625	487.006591796875	328
the reasons suggest that respondents have low levels of sophistication in running a	54.0	330.6222229003906	11.836181640625	487.01141357421875	328

In Table 6, we show the reasons that respondents provided for not sharing product storage	54.0	374.2435302734375	11.836181640625	487.00897216796875	379
with another business. The sample sizes in this table are small because only respondents	54.0	387.0660095214844	11.836181640625	486.99859619140625	379
who reported using storage (22% of the entire sample) were asked subsequent questions	54.0	399.8885192871094	11.836181640625	486.98883056640625	379

Not trusting other businesses is a socially taboo topic because community cohesion is valued	54.0	437.36981201171875	11.836181640625	487.00634765625	380
in Ethiopia and openly discussing distrust of others is discouraged. This reason was	54.0	450.19232177734375	11.836181640625	487.0042724609375	380
endorsed by 30% of the close-ended group, signiﬁcantly higher than the open-ended with	54.0	463.01483154296875	11.836181640625	487.0067138671875	380
probing group (10%). Only 14% of the open-ended without probing group cited this reason.	54.0	475.8374328613281	11.836181640625	487.0079345703125	380
This result supports Hypothesis 3 (close-ended responses will increase socially undesirable	54.0	488.659912109375	11.836181640625	486.995361328125	380
reporting), but there is no support for Hypothesis 4 (that probing increases socially	54.0	501.482421875	11.836181640625	486.99365234375	380
undesirable reports). The experimental manipulation did not affect reports about “never	54.0	514.3050537109375	11.836181640625	487.005615234375	380

Our goal was to investigate best practices for asking respondents about reasons for their	54.0	345.3681335449219	11.836181640625	487.00933837890625	428
behavior. Respondents endorsed more responses when asked close-ended (versus	54.0	358.19073486328125	11.836181640625	487.00067138671875	428
open-ended) questions. This ﬁnding suggests that close-ended questions may spark greater	54.0	371.0132141113281	11.836181640625	487.004638671875	428
engagement with the subject matter because respondents are forced to consider each option	54.0	383.8357238769531	11.836181640625	487.00823974609375	428
on its own, rather than reporting “top of mind” responses. Close-ended responses also	54.0	396.6582336425781	11.836181640625	487.011474609375	428
produced higher rates of socially undesirable responses, suggesting that close-ended	54.0	409.4808349609375	11.836181640625	487.00897216796875	428
responses may help to elicit attitudes on sensitive topics. Providing socially undesirable	54.0	422.3033142089844	11.836181640625	487.013916015625	428
reasons through close-ended questions may reduce the stigma of the response. An	54.0	435.1258239746094	11.836181640625	486.998291015625	428
alternative hypothesis is that respondents had simply never thought of that reason before.	54.0	447.94842529296875	11.836181640625	487.00347900390625	428
We leave it to future research to distinguish between these explanations.	54.0	460.77093505859375	11.836181640625	379.6171875	428
Second, probing did not affect the number of overall responses or the number of socially	54.0	485.42962646484375	11.836181640625	486.99786376953125	429
undesirable responses provided. This lack of an effect is notable, particularly because the	54.0	498.25213623046875	11.836181640625	487.006103515625	429
professional interviewers had experience and training in probing. In fact, for two out of three	54.0	511.07470703125	11.836181640625	487.0057373046875	429
questions, probing leads to more “other” responses that could not be classiﬁed into existing	54.0	523.897216796875	11.836181640625	487.00738525390625	429
or new categories. It is possible that spending time on probing may not be an efﬁcient use of	54.0	536.7197265625	11.836181640625	487.00897216796875	429
interviewersʼ efforts, particularly because interviewer probing may also introduce additional	54.0	549.5423583984375	11.836181640625	487.0074462890625	429
variance into estimates. However, additional studies based on larger sample sizes are	54.0	562.3648681640625	11.836181640625	487.0126953125	429
needed to replicate this null ﬁnding, particularly for more difﬁcult questions where probing	54.0	575.1873779296875	11.836166381835938	487.0091552734375	429
might be more effective. Future research could also investigate what types of probes are	54.0	588.0098876953125	11.836181640625	487.00543212890625	429

In sum, our results provide tentative support for the idea that close-ended questions without	54.0	625.4910888671875	11.836181640625	487.023681640625	430
probing are the preferred method of asking respondents to provide reasons for their	54.0	638.313720703125	11.836181640625	486.9971923828125	430
behavior, at least for this population and topic. We are limited, however, in that we do not	54.0	651.13623046875	11.836181640625	487.01123046875	430
have a gold standard that could specify which of the three designs produces the most valid	54.0	663.958740234375	11.836181640625	487.00714111328125	430
data. Future research should investigate the validity of different methods, particularly the	54.0	676.7813110351562	11.836181640625	487.0159912109375	430
assumption that the additional responses provided by the close-ended questions are	54.0	689.6038208007812	11.836181640625	487.0078125	430
meaningful. Researchers should also consider the possibility is that there is no method that	54.0	702.4263305664062	11.836181640625	487.010009765625	430
provides “true” reports, but simply that the three methods collect different types of data. For	54.0	715.248779296875	11.836181640625	486.98297119140625	430
example, open-ended questions may produce reasons that are immediately accessible in	54.0	728.0714111328125	11.836181640625	487.01019287109375	430

Our results demonstrate the feasibility of asking respondents questions about reasons for	54.0	93.06011962890625	11.836181640625	487.00726318359375	436
their behavior, but also raise questions about the validity of these data. Rates of item	54.0	105.8826904296875	11.836181640625	487.004638671875	436
non-response were less than 1% for these items, suggesting that individuals are willing to	54.0	118.7052001953125	11.836181640625	487.0025634765625	436
provide reasons for their behavior. However, our results cannot show whether the reasons	54.0	131.5277099609375	11.836181640625	486.9970703125	436
provided are accurate. Respondents may intentionally misreport reasons for their behavior or	54.0	144.35028076171875	11.836181640625	487.00579833984375	436
otherwise rationalize their behavior. Citing reasons for behavior may be cognitively	54.0	157.17279052734375	11.836181640625	487.00439453125	436
burdensome, particularly when respondents do not often consciously think about why they do	54.0	169.99530029296875	11.836181640625	487.0067138671875	436
(or do not) engage in behaviors. For example, asking about topics a respondent has not	54.0	182.81787109375	11.836181640625	487.0081787109375	436
considered before may encourage the respondent to create an answer on the spot, leading	54.0	195.640380859375	11.836181640625	487.006591796875	436
to inconsistent responses across items designed to measure similar concepts (Wilson 2013).	54.0	208.462890625	11.836181640625	487.00677490234375	436
Alternatively, interviewers may make errors when classifying responses. Because of these	54.0	221.2855224609375	11.836181640625	487.006591796875	436
limitations, we view respondent self-reports about why they engage in behaviors as one of	54.0	234.10797119140625	11.836181640625	487.0048828125	436
several possible research methods (in addition to qualitative research and experiments) that	54.0	246.93048095703125	11.836181640625	487.007568359375	436
policymakers could use when designing policies or programs to modify behavior.	54.0	259.75311279296875	11.836181640625	420.5998229980469	436
We encourage future research on the best practices and validity of asking respondents	54.0	284.41180419921875	11.836181640625	486.998291015625	437
questions about reasons for their behavior, particularly in larger samples in different	54.0	297.23431396484375	11.836181640625	487.00811767578125	437
populations and substantive content areas. Research could fruitfully investigate various	54.0	310.0567626953125	11.836181640625	486.9970703125	437
designs for designing these questions, such as using showcards for close-ended lists or	54.0	322.87939453125	11.836212158203125	487.005615234375	437
coding verbatim open-ended responses. Another promising avenue for future research is to	54.0	335.7019348144531	11.836181640625	487.00885009765625	437
study how to ask questions about why individuals do engage in behaviors rather than why	54.0	348.48931884765625	11.87127685546875	486.992919921875	437
they do not. We believe that future research about if and when it is appropriate to ask these	54.0	361.3118896484375	11.871307373046875	487.007568359375	437

individuals engage in particular behaviors.	54.0	386.9920349121094	11.836181640625	220.13873291015625	437

[1] An alternative method is collecting verbatim responses to open-ended questions and then	54.0	449.13201904296875	11.836181640625	487.00653076171875	439
coding the verbatim responses post-hoc, ideally with multiple coders. Although this method	54.0	461.91943359375	11.87127685546875	487.00958251953125	439
may reduce coding errors, it is also time and labor intensive. The survey we analyze in this	54.0	474.77703857421875	11.836181640625	486.9970703125	439

so it used immediate classiﬁcation methods by interviewers.	54.0	500.422119140625	11.836181640625	312.80657958984375	439
