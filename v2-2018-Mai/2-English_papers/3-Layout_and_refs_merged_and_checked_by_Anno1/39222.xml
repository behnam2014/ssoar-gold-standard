This article sets out to understand the context and influences of Irish migration to	113.42001342773438	173.05670166015625	9.9599609375	345.4721984863281	16

while for the younger generation – the fathers – fatherhood was played out in the	113.42001342773438	218.94281005859375	10.0335693359375	345.614013671875	16

in context. Secondly, it compares the life courses of the two generations and the social	113.41995239257812	322.7264404296875	9.9599609375	345.6669616699219	16

Thirdly, it explores men’s accounts of transmission. Finally, it discusses the ways in	113.41995239257812	345.5727233886719	9.96002197265625	345.3902587890625	16
which the experience of migration from a poor rural society plays out in the lives of	113.41995239257812	357.1665954589844	9.959991455078125	345.51239013671875	16

field in which generational processes occur (Kohli 1999). As emphasised by Bourdieu	113.42010498046875	304.12640380859375	9.9599609375	345.4999694824219	22
(1990), the social context in which the idea of a “generation” becomes meaningful is	113.42010498046875	315.45281982421875	9.96002197265625	345.3304748535156	22

be implicit as well as explicit (Bernstein 1996). The notion of “family habitus”	113.4188232421875	384.45269775390625	9.96002197265625	345.3292236328125	22
(Bourdieu 1990) denotes a set of dispositions related to particular practices which	113.4188232421875	396.0461730957031	9.959991455078125	345.69500732421875	22
may lead to regularities in patterns of transmission across family generations (ibid.). It	113.4188232421875	407.56646728515625	9.959991455078125	345.4399108886719	22

lies. Their first child was born there when Seamas was 24. After five years and a	113.42019653320312	350.20648193359375	9.959991455078125	345.4925231933594	56
second child the couple had saved enough money to put down a deposit on a large run	113.42019653320312	361.72637939453125	9.959991455078125	345.88836669921875	56
down property. By this time Seamas’ wife who was business minded was working	113.42019653320312	373.1726989746094	9.96002197265625	345.44293212890625	56
part time. Later, she set up her own building company, which was atypical both for	113.42019653320312	384.6462707519531	9.959991455078125	345.795166015625	56
her time and compared with the other cases. This did not influence Seamas’ view of	113.42019653320312	396.0929870605469	10.0335693359375	345.84613037109375	56
himself as the family breadwinner, albeit it meant the family was relatively well off as	113.42019653320312	407.68646240234375	9.959991455078125	345.7291259765625	56
a consequence. The couple refurbished the property with help from family and friends	113.42019653320312	419.20635986328125	9.959991455078125	345.35003662109375	56
over several years. Work remained at the centre of Seamas’ identity; he worked long	113.42019653320312	430.6526794433594	10.0335693359375	345.8047790527344	56
hours, often seven days a week, with periods away from home. He was still working	113.42021179199219	442.2664489746094	9.959991455078125	345.38035583496094	56
at the time we interviewed him. From his current vantage point, his definition of a	113.42022705078125	453.66644287109375	9.959991455078125	345.2830810546875	56

Seamas was proud of being a provider:	113.42027282714844	534.185791015625	9.959991455078125	156.1591033935547	58

It was his wife, he said, who had influenced the children’s aspirations and career	113.42028045654297	603.1121826171875	9.959991455078125	345.34879302978516	60
choices and been the disciplinarian. Seamas positioned himself as “the easy one”.	113.4202880859375	614.632080078125	10.033493041992188	326.06866455078125	60
Compare this life course trajectory with that of Seamas’ son, Willie. Willie, the	127.34027099609375	626.1820068359375	10.033554077148438	331.71990966796875	60

school along with many Irish origin children. On the advice of his mother’s friend, he	113.42025756835938	649.1019287109375	10.033554077148438	345.4886169433594	60
went to a “good” Catholic secondary school some distance from home and studied	113.42027282714844	660.621826171875	9.959991455078125	345.47117614746094	60

ble upward mobility through entry to the finance industry which was booming at the	113.42031860351562	177.49688720703125	9.9599609375	345.2514953613281	64
time (the 1990s); he joined an Irish bank, drawing on the social capital of his Irish	113.42031860351562	189.016357421875	9.9599609375	345.3212890625	64
heritage. There he met his wife to be, also of Irish origin.	113.42031860351562	200.53668212890625	9.9599609375	228.21511840820312	64
Aged 29, the couple married and two years later their son was born (eight at inter-	127.34021759033203	212.05657958984375	9.9599609375	331.9565658569336	64
view). Two more children followed. Willie became a father later in the life course	113.42044067382812	223.57647705078125	9.9599609375	345.29345703125	64
than his father and under much more favourable material conditions. By then, with	113.42044067382812	235.09637451171875	9.9599609375	345.8492126464844	64
two incomes from a well-paid industry, they had already bought their own house.	113.42037963867188	246.49639892578125	9.9599609375	345.4799499511719	64
Like his father, Willie’s life was driven by work. He too worked very long hours and	113.42037963867188	257.94268798828125	9.96002197265625	345.2005920410156	64
was often away from home and so lacked time for his children. However, despite the	113.42037963867188	269.56671142578125	9.9599609375	345.3019104003906	64
fact that Willie had a university education and was in a management job, he and his	113.42037963867188	281.08660888671875	9.9599609375	345.3319396972656	64
family continued to live within a stone’s throw of his parents where Willie had grown	113.42044067382812	292.53289794921875	9.96002197265625	345.3607482910156	64
up. He also sent his children to his former Catholic primary school.	113.42042541503906	304.12640380859375	9.9599609375	268.71922302246094	64
The accounts of the two men mirror one another. Seamas said that communication	127.34032440185547	315.52642822265625	9.9599609375	331.5953140258789	64
between them was limited when Willie was a child mainly because he (Seamas) was	113.42034912109375	327.04632568359375	9.9599609375	345.4514465332031	64
always working, a pattern which continued into adulthood. Like Seamas, Willie did	113.42034912109375	338.56658935546875	9.959991455078125	345.23223876953125	64
not recall his father spending much time with his father as a child: “he was never	113.42034912109375	350.0129089355469	10.0335693359375	345.50860595703125	64
there”, noting the similarities with his own fathering: “they’ll be in bed by the time	113.42034912109375	361.5328063964844	9.96002197265625	345.28228759765625	64
I’m home.” Willie’s memory of his relationship with his father while he was growing	113.4195556640625	373.0527038574219	9.96002197265625	345.47723388671875	64
up confirmed his father’s account – “non-confrontational” and sticking to “nice easy	113.418701171875	384.45269775390625	10.0335693359375	345.73699951171875	64
soft subjects which remains the case now”. Willie confirmed that his mother was the	113.41905212402344	395.97259521484375	10.0335693359375	345.6087188720703	64

Both, father and son described living in different worlds on account of their work	127.339111328125	419.08636474609375	9.959991455078125	331.7013244628906	64
and interests, using the same words. Seamas referred obliquely to differences in their	113.41912841796875	430.60626220703125	9.959991455078125	345.251220703125	64
education and occupations “you know we’re in different worlds, kind of thing now”	113.41912841796875	441.95257568359375	10.0335693359375	345.4286193847656	64
while Willie noted:	113.4192123413086	453.5460510253906	9.959991455078125	77.1098403930664	64

both in construction. I went into the financial industry and um, I’m sure no	127.33943176269531	488.0024719238281	9.959991455078125	317.7232208251953	65
more than I didn’t know what they did – to a technical level they don’t have a	127.33944702148438	499.5223693847656	9.959991455078125	317.9149169921875	65

I honestly think there’s more of a conscious effort for the father [today] to	127.33853912353516	614.4822998046875	9.960006713867188	317.7149887084961	67
have more one to one time with the children than previously and probably get	127.33853912353516	626.0726928710938	9.960006713867188	317.8151168823242	67
more engaged in what the children are up to and how they’re developing.	127.33853149414062	637.4323120117188	9.960006713867188	294.3341369628906	67
Willie considered himself “slightly more engaged” with his first born than his father	113.41851806640625	660.5018310546875	9.959991455078125	345.3907165527344	68
was with him at the same age, for example knowing more about his son’s school and	113.41851806640625	672.021728515625	10.033554077148438	345.3968505859375	68
friends. At the same time, he suggested a similar segregation of marital roles for his	113.41852569580078	683.6155395507812	9.960006713867188	345.3723678588867	68

build a better life for himself and his family. A further clue lies in the cultural sphere	113.41943359375	322.60650634765625	9.9599609375	345.2410888671875	74

strong continuities. Given that original identities play a pivotal role in constructing	113.41943359375	345.5263671875	9.959991455078125	345.6493225097656	74
biographical continuities, it is significant that Willie did not break with religious tradi-	113.41943359375	357.0462646484375	9.959991455078125	345.87646484375	74
tion, that he married into an Irish family, that he still felt Irish, and that he stayed	113.41921997070312	368.5665588378906	9.959991455078125	345.7043762207031	74
geographically close to his parents.	113.41921997070312	380.0864562988281	9.959991455078125	140.64352416992188	74
The transmission of identity is however habitual and not necessarily open to re-	127.33911895751953	391.6063537597656	9.959991455078125	331.9574203491211	74
flection, as may be seen in the way Seamas responded to questions relating to trans-	113.41961669921875	403.00634765625	9.959991455078125	345.9975280761719	74
mission in the interview. Seamas could not think what he had inherited from his father	113.42041015625	414.5262451171875	9.959991455078125	345.2809143066406	74
nor how he had influenced Willie except that he wanted a better life for him, just as	113.42041015625	426.046142578125	9.959991455078125	345.3481750488281	74
his had been better than his father’s.	113.42041015625	437.49285888671875	9.96002197265625	144.42861938476562	74
I didn’t want him to go out working like (inaudible) you know what I mean	127.3403091430664	460.5228576660156	9.959991455078125	317.56432342529297	75
working. It was great, he had school, he had a good childhood, you know what	127.34030151367188	471.9632568359375	9.959991455078125	317.9562072753906	75
I mean.	127.34030151367188	483.483154296875	9.959991455078125	30.048980712890625	75
However, Seamas pointed to aspects of identification, claiming his children and their	113.42040252685547	506.5857849121094	9.959991455078125	345.34098052978516	76
families as Irish:	113.42041015625	518.105712890625	9.959991455078125	66.43295288085938	76
They’re all Irish, they’ve always you know (pause) they’ve always been round	127.3403091430664	540.92236328125	9.959991455078125	317.6301803588867	77
with Irish and their friends here are Irish or Irish descent.	127.34030151367188	552.482666015625	9.959991455078125	233.0604248046875	77
Seamas also asserted their similar tastes describing how father and son both enjoyed a	113.42040252685547	575.585693359375	9.959991455078125	345.31153106689453	78
pint and watching Gaelic football together. Also striking is the fact that Willie contin-	113.42041015625	587.1055908203125	9.960006713867188	345.87677001953125	78
ues to live near his parents in the same, now gentrified, community where he grew up.	113.42050170898438	598.62548828125	9.960006713867188	345.77020263671875	78
But despite this communication between father and son was limited. Seamas com-	113.42050170898438	610.0254516601562	9.960006713867188	345.8766784667969	78
mented, emphasising the value he attached to ‘long hours’:	113.42050170898438	621.501953125	10.033554077148438	235.7388916015625	78
We don’t really, we don’t communicate much better now, no. Well I don’t see	127.34040069580078	644.5123901367188	9.960006713867188	317.87654876708984	79
him to be honest, he’s always – you know we’re in different worlds, kind of	127.34039306640625	656.0322875976562	10.000411987304688	318.0132141113281	79
thing now … but I mean he does his own thing. He works good long hours ac-	127.34037780761719	667.4322509765625	10.000411987304688	318.03721618652344	79

On the other hand, living so close Seamas helped Willie and his family with practical	113.42001342773438	154.5770263671875	9.9599609375	345.3805236816406	82
matters. For their part, both, his son and his grandsons helped Seamas with comput-	113.42001342773438	166.09649658203125	9.9599609375	345.87677001953125	82
ers. Moreover, close contact between the female generations was maintained.	113.42022705078125	177.49688720703125	9.9599609375	309.0749206542969	82
Similarly, Willie suggested strong themes of Irish identity. He holds an Irish pass-	127.34012603759766	189.016357421875	9.9599609375	331.9571762084961	82
port and counted himself as Irish while at the same time integrating country of birth	113.42059326171875	200.53668212890625	9.9599609375	345.6346740722656	82
and residence into his identity:	113.42059326171875	212.05657958984375	9.9599609375	122.51728820800781	82
Depends if it’s convenient to be one or t’other. Um, yeah I would see myself as	127.34049224853516	234.9930419921875	9.96002197265625	317.50170135498047	83
Irish. But it depends on who it’s going to annoy most typically.	127.34049224853516	246.39306640625	9.96002197265625	251.03865814208984	83
He remained a Catholic and a church goer, if an infrequent one. Willie gave a rich	113.42050170898438	269.56671142578125	9.9599609375	345.5376892089844	84
account of the mainly cultural capital passed on both by his parents, referring to their	113.42050170898438	281.08660888671875	9.9599609375	345.34112548828125	84
strong work ethic which he also wanted for his children. Like his father he spoke of	113.42050170898438	292.60650634765625	9.9599609375	345.3514099121094	84
family resemblances (Mason 2008), noting his delight at having been stopped in the	113.42050170898438	304.12640380859375	9.9599609375	345.5536804199219	84
street by someone remarking on his own son’s resemblance to his grandfather. He	113.42050170898438	315.45281982421875	9.96002197265625	345.32275390625	84
also felt that he had inherited his father’s social skills (“social demeanour”) and he	113.42050170898438	326.97271728515625	10.0335693359375	345.75982666015625	84
identified with his father’s equal treatment of others:	113.42050170898438	338.4930114746094	10.0335693359375	210.72665405273438	84
I don’t give two hoots if you earn two grand a year or two million quid a year.	127.34000396728516	361.50311279296875	9.959991455078125	317.6479721069336	85
I will treat you exactly the same. I think that’s a big thing I’ve probably got	127.33999633789062	373.02301025390625	9.959991455078125	317.6598815917969	85
from him (pause) and then to a degree socialising in places that serve alcohol	127.33999633789062	384.4634094238281	9.959991455078125	317.71160888671875	85
is probably another major thing.	127.33999633789062	395.9833068847656	9.959991455078125	130.74032592773438	85
Among others, Willie saw his parents as role models for his children:	113.42050170898438	419.08636474609375	9.959991455078125	276.8256530761719	86
... between us spending hundreds of hours a week with them (Mm) um, by the	127.34000396728516	441.9632873535156	9.959991455078125	317.7249069213867	87
way you act, by the way you talk – the views you have – how you encourage	127.33999633789062	453.4427795410156	10.000396728515625	318.0472412109375	87
them to discuss their views and develop their views – all of that will have a	127.33987426757812	464.96307373046875	10.000396728515625	318.0019226074219	87
huge consequence on them probably.	127.34010314941406	476.5229797363281	9.959991455078125	148.5810089111328	87
At the same time, he stressed that his parents did not intervene in areas such as reli-	113.42020416259766	499.6256408691406	9.959991455078125	345.8763656616211	88
gious upbringing or education.	113.42001342773438	511.0256042480469	9.959991455078125	122.45712280273438	88
For his part Willie said he had no fixed ambitions for his sons; he would like to	127.33991241455078	522.5455322265625	9.959991455078125	331.5389633178711	88
give them financial stability without handing everything to them on a plate. To some	113.419921875	534.0657958984375	9.959991455078125	345.321533203125	88
extent his easy-going attitude is like his father’s:	113.419921875	545.5121459960938	10.033538818359375	194.09909057617188	88
My level of empathy is you know short of having a limb hanging off, you know,	127.34001922607422	568.5626220703125	9.959991455078125	318.1129837036133	89
I’m not really worried about what happens to you, because it’ll be all right	127.34002685546875	579.9222412109375	9.959991455078125	317.651611328125	89

Reflecting at the end of the interview, Willie showed his awareness of the historical	113.4205322265625	614.5855712890625	9.960006713867188	345.4416198730469	90
context which created discontinuity between his own life and that of his father. His	113.4205322265625	626.1355590820312	9.960006713867188	345.5019836425781	90
narrative demonstrates a detailed understanding of what it meant for men like his	113.4205322265625	637.5355834960938	9.960006713867188	345.46990966796875	90

To my mind I was brought up in a totally different economic environment to my	127.34002685546875	154.51409912109375	9.96002197265625	317.85797119140625	93

ferent world, you know. I think for both of them there was a lack of education,	127.33975219726562	211.99365234375	9.96002197265625	317.65069580078125	93

from and the world they experienced, especially from like the ages of twelve,	127.33975219726562	246.4334716796875	9.96002197265625	318.16998291015625	93

eration, but I just don’t see that same leap happening between the childhood I	127.33981323242188	269.46337890625	10.00042724609375	317.74005126953125	93

Interestingly, Willie’s eight year old son, Michael, expressed some resistance to his	113.41991424560547	304.05279541015625	9.96002197265625	345.3300552368164	94
father’s practices. He said he did not want the same kind of job and thought his father	113.419921875	315.45281982421875	10.0335693359375	345.6107177734375	94

... because sometimes he’s in a meeting and when there’s an argument then	127.33972930908203	349.9828186035156	10.000396728515625	317.7488021850586	95
sometimes he isn’t back till like two, three (in the morning) … which I get real-	127.33972930908203	361.5027160644531	10.000396728515625	318.1566696166992	95

Michael gave a consistent and graphic account which confirmed what he saw to be	113.4198226928711	396.0457763671875	9.959991455078125	345.40637969970703	96

rather critical of this, suggesting his father needed more practice, especially with	113.41983032226562	511.0252380371094	9.959991455078125	345.4512023925781	96

However, grandfathers did not pass on their own disadvantages to their sons but	127.3395767211914	327.04632568359375	9.9599609375	331.4888229370117	101
gave them stable if not materially well endowed childhoods. In Willie’s case, as in the	113.41958618164062	338.4930114746094	9.96002197265625	345.2884216308594	101
other Irish cases, the spur to work hard was transmitted to the fathers through their	113.41958618164062	350.08648681640625	9.959991455078125	345.2230224609375	101

ers, especially in Willie’s case. The institutional context of Roman Catholic schools	113.41940307617188	373.0527038574219	10.0335693359375	345.5845947265625	101

However, despite their upward occupational mobility, the fathers (with the same	127.3406982421875	453.6663513183594	9.959991455078125	331.36810302734375	101

generations. In Willie’s case, as in all but one of the Irish cases, as a son of a migrant	113.419921875	327.093017578125	10.033538818359375	345.6387634277344	105
it was the transmission of a will to succeed in education and the workplace which	113.42018127441406	338.68646240234375	9.959991455078125	345.48460388183594	105
appears to have been significant in reproducing particular fatherhood practices.	113.42019653320312	350.20635986328125	9.959991455078125	345.8896789550781	105
Structural ambivalence is also mediated via the transmission of cultural resources	113.42019653320312	361.72625732421875	9.959991455078125	345.41546630859375	105
which form part of the migrant family heritage in particular through the persistence of	113.42019653320312	373.24615478515625	9.959991455078125	345.3704528808594	105
a strong sense of Irish identity. Like Willie, the fathers’ “Irishness” was sustained in	113.42019653320312	384.57257080078125	10.0335693359375	345.47796630859375	105
their childhoods through growing up in Irish communities in the UK and annual pil-	113.42041015625	396.16644287109375	9.959991455078125	345.9961853027344	105
grimages made with parents to Ireland in the summer holidays. Irish identity also	113.4200439453125	407.68634033203125	9.959991455078125	345.3705749511719	105
continued to be closely entwined with religious identity (Bruce et al. 2004, 13) but did	113.4200439453125	419.20623779296875	9.959991455078125	345.4377746582031	105
not preclude identification with Britain. Irish identity was transmitted between fathers	113.4200439453125	430.72613525390625	9.959991455078125	345.39105224609375	105
and sons sometimes through passing on Irish names; and importantly via cultural	113.4200439453125	442.26593017578125	9.959991455078125	345.32049560546875	105
performance such as going to church and cultural centres some of which pertained to	113.4200439453125	453.6659240722656	9.959991455078125	345.5003662109375	105
particular forms of masculinity; having “a pint” together at the pub, watching and	113.4200439453125	465.11224365234375	9.96002197265625	345.31103515625	105
playing particular Gaelic sports, a mutual interest in Irish music. The two generations	113.4200439453125	476.7057189941406	9.959991455078125	345.39117431640625	105
also pointed to the transmission of gendered family dispositions and resemblances	113.4200439453125	488.2256164550781	9.959991455078125	345.5186462402344	105
manifest in references to similar appearance, character and manner, propensities for	113.4200439453125	499.7455139160156	9.959991455078125	345.27130126953125	105
sociability and competence in “talking the talk” (an iconic Irish characteristic), as in	113.4200439453125	511.19219970703125	9.96002197265625	345.3693542480469	105
the case of Seamas and Willie. These forms of transmitted cultural capital are the	113.4200439453125	522.665771484375	9.959991455078125	345.4522399902344	105
means by which Irish male generations created a shared history in the context of the	113.4200439453125	534.1856689453125	9.959991455078125	345.3222351074219	105
migration experience.	113.4200439453125	545.70556640625	9.959991455078125	87.01029968261719	105
At the same time, as in Willie’s case, structural ambivalences of social mobility	127.3399429321289	557.1519165039062	9.96002197265625	331.6050338745117	105
were not entirely reconciled at a personal level. Willie constructed his world as very	113.419921875	568.745361328125	9.959991455078125	345.4010009765625	105
different from that of his migrant father, while also being conscious that this was part	113.419921875	580.1453857421875	9.960006713867188	345.58099365234375	105
of his heritage. There were therefore clear differences between the generations in a	113.419921875	591.6656494140625	9.960006713867188	345.7563171386719	105
Mannheimian sense. The second generation viewed their parents as members of a	113.419921875	603.185546875	9.960006713867188	345.38031005859375	105
particular generation which was shaped both by the harshness of their early lives in	113.419921875	614.7054443359375	9.960006713867188	345.351806640625	105
Ireland and by their experiences as migrants in a hostile society in which they had to	113.419921875	626.2554321289062	9.960006713867188	345.2513427734375	105
work very hard “to get by” – issues which few of the older generation were willing to	113.419921875	637.7017822265625	10.033554077148438	345.4704895019531	105
dwell upon in their interviews. In that sense migration was a clear generational mark-	113.419921875	649.1753540039062	9.960006713867188	345.8767395019531	105
